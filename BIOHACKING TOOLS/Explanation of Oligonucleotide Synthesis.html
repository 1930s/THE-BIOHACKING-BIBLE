  <p align="left"><font size="3">Oligonucleotide synthesis is a remarkably simple 
    process that has far reaching implications. Oligonucleotide synthesis is extremely 
    useful in laboratory procedures. It is used to make primers crucial in methods 
    such as PCR replication. Making a custom oligonucleotide is additionally useful 
    because they will only bind to the region of DNA that is complementary to 
    your custom oligonucleotide sequence. This allows specific segments of DNA 
    to be amplified. In addition, custom oligonucleotide synthesis allows other 
    sequences, such as restriction sites, to be added on to the desired oligonucleotide. 
    Custom oligonucleotides are generally 15-20 bases in length which can limit 
    how many additional sequences can be added on to the desired primer sequence.

  <p align="left"><font size="+3">Step 1: De-blocking</font><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">The first base, which is attached to the solid support, is at 
    first inactive because all the active sites have been blocked or protected. 
    To add the next base, the DMT group protecting the 5'-hydroxyl group must 
    be removed. This is done by adding a base, either dichloroacetic acid (DCA) 
    or trichloroacetic acid in dichloromethane (DCM), to the reaction column (IDT, 
    2000). The 5&#8217;-hydroxyl group is now the only reactive group on the base 
    monomer. This ensures that the addition of the next base will only bind to 
    that site. The reaction column is then washed to remove any extra acid and 
    by-products (BioSource, 2003).</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+3">Step 2: Base Condensation</font><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">The next base monomer cannot be added until it has been activated. 
    This is achieved by adding tetrazole to the base. Tetrazole cleaves off one 
    of the groups protecting the phosphorus linkage (IDT, 2000). This base is 
    then added to the reaction column. The active 5&#8217;-hydroxyl group of the 
    preceeding base and the newly activated phosphorus bind to loosely join the 
    two bases together. This forms an unstable phosphite linkage. The reaction 
    column is then washed to remove any extra tetrazole, unbound base and by-products 
    (BioSource, 2003).</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="rxngif.gif" width="659" height="442"></p>
  <p align="left">Figure 3. Top left: A fully blocked base next in line to be 
    added onto previous base. Top Right: The next base is now activated by tetrazole 
    (left) and the previous base is de-blocked ready for a base addition (right). 
    Bottom Right: 5'-hydroxyl of previous base binds to phosphorus linkage of 
    next base (arrow). Bottom Left: The base has been successfully been added

  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+3">Step 3: Capping</font><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">When the activated base is added to the reaction column some 
    does not bind to the active 5&#8217;-hydroxyl site of the previous base. If 
    this group is left unreacted in a step it is possible for it to react in later 
    additions of different bases. This would result in an oligonucleotide with 
    a deletion. To prevent this from occurring, the unbound, active 5&#8217;-hydroxyl 
    group is capped with a protective group which subsequently prohibits that 
    strand from growing again. This is done by adding acetic anhydride and N-methylimidazole 
    to the reaction column (IDT, 2000). These compounds only react with the 5&#8217;-hydroxyl 
    group. The base is capped by undergoing acetylation. The reaction column is 
    then washed to remove any extra acetic anhydride or N-methylimidazole (BioSource, 
    2003).</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="cap.gif" width="522" height="236"></p>
  <p align="left">Figure 4. The base on the left (already attached to the solid 
    support) did not bind to a base in the Base Condensation step. The unreacted 
    5'-hydroxyl is blocked from further reactions by acetylation. Image used with

  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+3">Step 4: Oxidation</font><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">In step 2 the next desired base was added to the previous base, 
    which resulted in a unstable phosphite linkage. To stabalize this linkage 
    a solution of dilute iodine in water, pyridine, and tetrahydrofuran is added 
    to the reaction column (IDT, 2000). The unstable phosphite linkage is oxidized 
    to form a much more stable phosphate linkage. </p>

  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+3">Repeat</font><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Steps one through four are repeated until all desired bases 
    have been added to the oligonucleotide. Each cycle is approximately 98/99% 
    efficient (IDT, 2000). <br>
  </p>
  <p align="center"><img src="cycle.gif" width="479" height="540"> </p>

    (B), base condensation (C), capping (C), and oxidation (D)are illustrated.

  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+3">Post Synthesis</font><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">After all bases have been added the oligonucletide must be cleaved 
    from the solid support and deprotected before it can be effectively used. 
    This is done by incubating the chain in concentrated ammonia at a high temperature 
    for an extended amount of time. All the protecting groups are now cleaved, 
    including the cyanoethyl group, the heterocyclic protection groups, and the 
    DMT group on the very last base (BioSource, 2003). </p>

  <p align="left"><font size="+3">Final Product</font><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">The final product is a mixture of the sought after oligonucleotide, 
    cleaved protective groups and oligonucleotides with internal deletions (IDT, 
    2000). This mixture of wanted and unwanted species is what the oligonucleotide 
    synthesis companies send to the recipient. To obtain a solution only containing 
    the desired oligonucleotide, the recipient must desalt the heterogeneous mixture.

  <p align="left"><font size="+3">Desalting</font><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Desalting is done to purify the solution. It removes any species 
    that may interfer with future reactions. The major problematic ingredient 
    in the heterogeneous mixture is the ammonium ion. To filter the solution of 
    the ammonium ions three different methods can be utilized. They are ethanol 
    precipitation, size-exlusion chromatography, or reverse-phase chromatography 
    (BioSource, 2003). </p>
