|<b>Research Interest:</b>
|Currently working on developing mapping populations and the methodology for mapping herbicide resistance genes in the Lolium species as well as in Echinochloa oryzoides and E. phyllopogon, major weeds infesting rice fields of California that have also evolved resistance to herbicides.

|<b>Research Summary:</b>
|To understand the inheritance, mechanism and molecular genetics of herbicide resistance genes in weeds using both classical and molecular plant breeding approches.  Collected and continues to obtain molecular marker (SSR and SRAP) data for studies on the genetic diversity and spread of invasive weeds, Cortaderia selloana.  Also developing mapping populations and the methodology for mapping herbicide resistance genes in the Lolium species as well as in <i>Echinochloa oryzoides</i> and <i>E. phyllopogon</i> , major weeds infesting rice fields of California that have evolved resistance to herbicides. Collected wild accessions and confirmed herbicide resistance
