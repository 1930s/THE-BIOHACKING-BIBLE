We are trying to put a immuno tag onto aiia and these are the PCR primers which we think will work

The primer at the 5’ end of the coding strand is the same as the coding strand.


 '''We are using this primer'''
 ______________________ = RESTRICTION SITES
                       ___________________________ = Immuno TAG
                                                  _____________________ = same as start of gene (ie. binds to - strand)
 gaattcgcggccgcttctagagGATTATAAAGATGATGATGATAAAGGTatgacagtaaagaagctttat

This was orderd orrignally and is right

'''Problem'''

This Primer was ordered

 _______________  = complemantary to end of gene (ie. binds to + strand)  
                _____________________ = RESTRICTION SITES (complementary to + sequence)
 aatcatcgaattattatgatcatcgccggcgacgtc

This primer should be complementary to the coding strand so the coding strand made from this primer will be

 Primer           aatcatcgaattattatgatcatcgccggcgacgtc
 Sequence Created GACGTCGCCGGCGATGATCATAATAATTCGATGATT


'''There are no restriction sites for spe1 and pst1.''' 

 '''The restriction sites can be cut by''' 
 Name	 Sequence 	SiteLength 	Overhang 	Frequency 	Cut Positions
 NaeI 	GCCGGC 	           6 		blunt 			1 		9 
 AcyI 	GRCGYC             6 		five_prime 		1		 2 
 BclI 	TGATCA 	           6 		five_prime 		1		 15 
 Cfr10I	RCCGGY 	           6 		five_prime 		1		 7 
 SgrAI 	CRCCGGYG 	   8 		five_prime 		1		 7 
 AatII 	GACGTC 	           6 		three_prime 		1		 5 
 Hpy99I CGWCG 	           5 		three_prime 		1		 7

However none of these are complementary to any of the registary restriction enzymes so new primers must be ordered.

'''Redisigning the primers'''

End of desired AiiA gene

 cgaaaactacgctttagtagcttaataaTACTAGTAGCGGCCGCTGCAG 3’
 					  
 			    Spe1	   ------ pst1

'''Order the Reverse and complement'''

 '''We are usin this primer'''
 CTGCAGCGGCCGCTACTAGTATTATTAAGCTACTAAAGCGTAGTTTTCG

This should work

==Sequencing aiiA==

We are sequencing from the plasmid into the part in both directions, This should give us two overlapping sequences which we can align to get the full sequence of the promoters, RBS, Terminators and protein.
