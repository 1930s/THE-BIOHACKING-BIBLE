==Example Question==
===Question from Steve Koch===
What did he say was kT in "biophysics units" again?
===Answer from Steve Koch===
I think he said about 4 pN - nm for room temperature--[[User:Skoch3|Skoch3]] 02:05, 19 January 2007 (EST)
===Follow on from Steve===
Today, Mike Pikaart was using "kcal / mol" which is the convenient unit for biochemistry.  I do believe that room temperature (300 Kelvin) is about 0.6 kcal / mol.  That is:
:: 4 pN - nm = 0.6 kcal / mol = 1/40 eV
