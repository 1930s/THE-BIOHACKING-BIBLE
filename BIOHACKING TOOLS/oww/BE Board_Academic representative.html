==Description==
We currently have three academic representatives.  One position is devoted more to the Industrial Seminar Series and the others to academic events, but the divisions are informal.  Everyone helps organize the BE retreat, run the annual student survey, and analyze and pass relevant results to BE administration. They also organize study breaks for first years and help maintain the BE Graduate Student Handbook. The ISS position is in charge of identifying, contacting, and hosting speakers from the industrial sector whose experience and expertise would help prepare BE students for future industrial positions and collaborations.

==Current and Past Activities==
*Seminar on Teaching Skills/TAing
*Curriculum development talks for undergrad program, 20.109 lab
*ISS Speakers from venture capital, startups, big pharmaceutical companies
