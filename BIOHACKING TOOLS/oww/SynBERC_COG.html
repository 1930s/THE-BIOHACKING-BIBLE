Welcome to the Construction Optimization Group (COG)!  

At the [http://synberc.private.openwetware.org/wiki/2007_Semi-Annual_Retreat-Sept_14-16%2C_2007 last SynBERC retreat] SynBERCers decided that solving the challenge of automated DNA assembly/cloning would be a priority for the center.    COG will be tasked with drafting a report for the upcoming NSF visit in March(?) that evaluates current assembly approaches and proposes a path forward.  This page is just getting started, please add/edit!

=Goals=
#Maintain communication across labs on status of automated assembly projects.  
#Produce a [[SynBERC:COG/Report|report]] with evaluation of current assembly approaches and recommendations for going forward.

=Meetings=
*[[SynBERC:COG/October 2007 Meeting]] - TK debrief on QIAcube
**[[SynBERC:COG/Homework]]: 
**#What's the cloning amount (and type) per lab ?
**#What experiment can't we do that we'd like to do?
*[[SynBERC:COG/December 2007 Meeting]] - Lane & Anderson research updates
*[[SynBERC:COG/January 2008 Meeting]] - Registry research update
