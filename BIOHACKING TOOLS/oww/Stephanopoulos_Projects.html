Our research is focused on Metabolic Engineering - the improvement of cellular properties, using modern genetic tools. This field encompasses two important components:

# '''The modification of biochemical pathways inside cells''', and
# '''The rigorous evaluation of the resulting cellular phenotypes.'''
 

Our most recent research has been focused on the following topics:

:* [[Stephanopoulos:Production of biochemicals in E. coli | '''Metabolic Engineering of <i>E.Coli</i> for the production of biochemicals''']]

:* [[Stephanopoulos:Inverse Metabolic Engineering | '''Inverse Metabolic Engineering''']]

:* [[Stephanopoulos:gTME | '''gTME''']]

:* [[Stephanopoulos:Flux Determination | '''Flux Determination''']]

:* [[Stephanopoulos:Hepatocyte Physiology | '''Hepatocyte Physiology''']]

:* [[Stephanopoulos:Metabolomics | '''Metabolomics''']]

:* [[Stephanopoulos:Rational Drug Design | '''Rational Drug Design''']]

:* [[Stephanopoulos:Systems Biology | '''Systems Biology''']]


To accomplish the above goals we make use of a diverse array of scientific tools and
methods, many of which have also become areas of research for our group:

:* [[Stephanopoulos:Bioinformatics and Systems Biology | '''Bioinformatics and Systems Biology''']] - Our group was one of the first to realize the importance of computational tools for handling the large volume of data generated by microarrays and other technologies.

:* [[Stephanopoulos:Methods for intracellular flux determination | '''Methods for intracellular flux determination''']] - Fluxes are determined by material balancing, NMR fine spectra analysis and GC-MS measurements.

:* [[Stephanopoulos:DNA microarrays | '''DNA microarrays''']] - We have developed full genome microarrays for ''Synechocystis'' Sp., and partial microarrays for ''C. glutamicum'', ''E. coli'', and the mouse genomes. 

:* [[Stephanopoulos:Bioreaction network analysis | '''Bioreaction network analysis''']]
