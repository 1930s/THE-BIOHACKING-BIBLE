===Miniprep===
1. Plasmids (2 samples each)
    R0010: lac operon promoter
    E7104: T7 promoter + GFP
    E0241: GFP
2. Protocol
    - w/ 5 mL samples, 1 mL saved for glycerol stock
    - rest of samples transferred to 1.5 eppendorfs and centrifuged to form pellet
    - supernatant removed and pellet resuspended in 250 microL Buffer P1
    - 250 microL Buffer P2 added and tube inverted 4-6 times for mixing
       (no vortexing to prevent shearing of genomic DNA; let sit for no longer than 5 min)
    - 350 microL Buffer N3 added and tube inverted 4-6 times for mixing
    - centrifuged @ 13,000 rpm for 10 min
       (formation of white pellet)
    - supernatant transferred to QIAprep spin column and centrifuged for 1 min
    - 0.5 mL Buffer PB added and centrifuged for 1 min
       (optional)
    - added 0.75 mL Buffer PE for washing and centrifuged for 1 min
    - flowthrough discarded and centrifuged for 1 min to remove residual buffer
    - QIAprep column transferred to 1.5 eppendorfs
    - 50 microL water added to center of column
       (let column stand for 1 min)
    - centrifuged for 1 min
    - nanodropped


===Digestion===
1. Materials
    8 microL DNA (R0010, E0241)
    2.5 microL 10x BSA
    2.5 microL 10x Buffer (Buffer 2)
    11 microL dH2O
    0.5 microL enzyme 1 and 2 (SpeI and PstI, XbaI and PstI)
    total vol = 25 microL
2. Protocol
    - checked www.neb.com to determine correct Buffer
    - digested @ 37 dC for 1 hr
    - heat shocked @ 97 dc for 15 min to inactivate restriction enzymes
    - added 0.1 microL (1 unit) of 10,000 units/mL CIP to vector DNA (R0010)
    - incubated vector DNA @ 37 dC for 1 hr
