Abstract 

<p>We describe a novel oxygen polarization sensor based on
a single molecule that changes the observed anisotropy
of its emission with variation of the oxygen concentration.
The approach is demonstrated both in solution and in
solid films. A simple mathematical description of the
sensor is included and experimentally verified. The technique
demonstrated here creates opportunity for development
of a new class of polarization-based dyes and
sensors.</p>
