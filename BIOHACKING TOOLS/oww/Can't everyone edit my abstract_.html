OpenWetWare is a growing on-line community of scientists.  Whilst it is possible that somebody would vandalise your page, it is very unlikely, as each user account is linked to a lab and university.  However, if you are worried about vandalism, you can check the history of your page by clicking history to see that only you have edited it.  You can also click "my watchlist" in the top right corner of your screen and keep track of all changes to this page in the future.
