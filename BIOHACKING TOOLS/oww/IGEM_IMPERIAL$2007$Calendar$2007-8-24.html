==Debrief==
===Modelling===
*Simulations almost completed - will be put on the wiki during the weekend
*Compared the modelled graph of pLux construct with the one got by experiment - have the same general shape but no peek in the model
*ID construct - problem with the constitutive promoter - need more data 

===Vesicles===
*Have small vesicles with GFP - have more in quantity than before but not entirely sure if they are actually vessicles
*Need to decide whether to concentrate on gene expression or proof of concept - need more people in the vesicles team

===Lab team===
*Finished makig the reaction mixture

===Protocols===
*Tested homemade cell extract with the reaction buffer - doean't work
*LuxR construct - works quite well in-vitro
*Will test comercial cell extract with the homemade reaction buffer

===Meeting with Prof. Kitney===
*Make presentations - make them see the big picture
*Need to confirm length of meeting
*Presentation teams:
*#Veso - Dirk, Alex
*#CBD - Alex, PPX, Ant, Lucas
