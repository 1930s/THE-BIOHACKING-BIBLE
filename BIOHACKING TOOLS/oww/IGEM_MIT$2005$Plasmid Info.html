===BioBrick Plasmids===

====1 series====
*high copy, good for cloning (as long as what we're cloning 
*get pSB1AK3

====2 series====
*variable copy, inducible plasmid
*adds an extra cloning step, if you have to move to desired vector  
*pSB2K3

====3 series====


====4 series====
*pSB4A3 might be a good option for final construct
