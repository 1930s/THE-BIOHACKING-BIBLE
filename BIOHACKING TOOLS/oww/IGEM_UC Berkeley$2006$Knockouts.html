==Procedure for Knockouts==
#50mL LB+Carb+Kan and 5mL starter culture plus 200mg/mL Arabinose
#Grow to OD=.8 (the higher the better)
#Spin approx. 40mL in 50mL conical, 3 minutes @ 8000
#Resuspend 30mL 10% glycerol
#Spin 3 minutes @ 7500
#Repeat glycerol suspension (step 4)
#Dump supernatant, resuspend in remaining liquid (don't add anything in this step)
#Electroporate 50ul cells and 1ul PCR product
#Rescue one hour @ 37C
#Plate

==Excising FRT-flanked cassettes with pCP20==
#Grow up a colony of the strain containing the cassette from a freshly restreaked plate
#Prepare a small scale electrocompetent cell prep, transform with pCP20
#Plate on Amp, or Cm+Amp, at 30 degrees
#Next day, use a tip or toothpick to swab some of the colonies, put in 4 mL of 2YT
#Grow to saturation at 37 degrees
#Dilute 10^6, plate on LB-only plates at 43 degrees
#Grow up and spot individual colonies on Amp and the excision marker
