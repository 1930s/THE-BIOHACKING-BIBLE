==General Info==
* From jellyfish ''Aeqorea victoria''
*[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?db=protein&val=1169893 wtGFP sequence] on NCBI
* 238 amino acids
* The fluorophore is tyrosine Y66 and the surrounding amino acids of Ser(65)-Tyr(66)-Gly(67) are also critical <cite>zacharias</cite>.
* Oxygen is required for maturation of the fluorophore

==GFP Variants==
*GFPmut3b - S65G, S72A
*[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_E0040 ''GFP''mut3*] - mutations from wt: S2R,S65G,S72A
**This is GFPmut3b<cite>Cormack</cite> with an accidental mutation at position 2 that doesn't affect function according to the authors.<cite>Andersen</cite>
*[[Emerald]] - F64L, S65T, S72A, N149K, M153T, I167T
* EGFP - F64L, S65T + optimized for human codons with 35-fold increase in fluorescence over GFP <cite>li97</cite>
* Other variants and their mutations can be found in Shaner supplementary table 2 <cite>shaner05</cite>

==Mutations==
* R96A: ''slows'' cyclization reaction from minutes to months
* S65T: 5-6x increase in amplitude and red shift 
* Y203I: eliminate excitation peak at 475nm, leaving lower peak of 399nm. emission remains at 511nm, producing large Stokes shift
* S65(G|T) and T203(Y|F|W|H) -> YFP
* Y66W: GFP -> CFP
* Y66H: GFP -> BFP (more blue than CFP), dim, easily photobleached
* Y66F: excitation 360nm, emission 442nm
* A206K: make monomeric
