===Took Out LC's of I14032, B0014, R0051===
*1ml for glycerol stock
*rest miniprepped (for sequencing and 3A ligation)
**when spun down, B0014 cells slightly reddish tint? Also, did not pellet well in spin down after adding buffer N3. Sample discarded and new LC made with second batch of transformed cells.
**Nanodrop results for other two: I14032(165.2 ng/µl), R0051(16.8 ng/µl)

===Gel Electrophoresis of Digestions===
Wells (top to bottom)
:*2-log, B0034, CPX, I14032, 1 kb
Expected lengths:
:*I14032: 37bp insert, 2.7kbp backbone
:*B0034: 12bp insert, 2kbp backbone
:*CPX: 720 bp insert, 3.5kbp backbone

===Transformations===
*Transformed DH5 alpha with the mer operon and the gfp part to send for sequencing
*PCR mer operon in psb3k3
*I3500 in psb3k3
