=== CO<sub>2</sub> independent medium with 0.5% FBS ===
====Description ====
Change cell cultures to this medium right before imaging under microscope
==== Ingredients ====
* 49-50 ml CO<sub>2</sub> independent medium
* 1 ml L-glutamine (200 mM)
* 250 ul 100% FBS (0.5%)

=== 0.5X trypsin in PBS (40ml)===
* warm up and add 2 ml 10X trypsin-EDTA (in freezer) to 38 ml PBS

===2% Gelatin (200 ml)===
* get 200 ml MQ H<sub>2</sub>O, weigh 4 g Gelatin (cell culture grade) and add to H<sub>2</sub>O, gently shake bottle, put on a tray containing some water, loose the cap of the bottle, autoclave with liquid cycle (30min). After take out, be sure to shake the bottle until gelatin desolve uniformly in liquid, keep in refrigerator for later use.
