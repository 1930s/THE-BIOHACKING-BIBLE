* Is it important that PO4 site and catalytic domain be grouped together?
**If so, then we must pass some sort of catalytic activity between devices.
**If not, then we can just pass concentration.

* Adequacy of Vmax as a signal carrier
** Vmax is only relevant at very high substrate concentrations
**At all other substrate concentrations, we care about both kcat and [E]
