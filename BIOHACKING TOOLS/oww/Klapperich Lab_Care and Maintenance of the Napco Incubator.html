How to care for the Napco Incubator

==Materials==

==Procedure==

Check that there is water in the basin every two or three days.
If the water runs out, the relative humidity will be too low, causing the temperature and CO2 levels to be uncontrollable.  If the incubator is over the temperature by several degrees, it may be necessary to reset the incubator.  This may be done by turning off the power on the left rear panel of the incubator, while unscrewing the outlet fuse on the rear panel.  Allow incubator to return to a temperature below 37.0 0C and restart the incubator, re-screwing the fuse first and then turning on the power.
