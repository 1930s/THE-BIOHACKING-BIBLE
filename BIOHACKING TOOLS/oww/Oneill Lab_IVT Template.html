Good hybridization using riboprobes requires a high purity, well designed template for ''in vitro'' transcription. This protocol provides a straightforward strategy for producing a template utilizing TA cloning and PCR amplification.

==Generating the Template==
#Clone the CDS or region of interest for your probe into a plasmid vector.
#*The simplest method for this is PCR amplification off cDNA followed by TA cloning. If this is not possible, traditional digestion and subcloning may be required.
#Determine the orientation of your insert by sequencing from the vector DNA.
#*It is critical to know the orientation of your insert relative to your cloning vector of choice.
#*This will allow you to choose the appropriate enzyme for IVT, and thus control which strand is synthesized.
#There are two methods for actually creating the template from this point.
##Typically the vector is linearized with a restriction endonuclease, such that the IVT enzyme will transcribe the insert without running onto the vector sequence.
##*This can become difficult for situations where no unique restriction site is available for use, or for very large inserts where complete transcripts may be less abundant.
##Alternatively, PCR amplification off the vector can be used to create a linear product including the appropriate viral promoter site.
##*This is very easy when using plasmids such as pBluescript or the TA cloning vectors like pSC-a (from Stratagene) and TOPO.
##*Utilize the M13 primer binding site flanking the viral promoter you wish to use in addition to a gene specific oligo and you will amplify a linear dsDNA molecule containing your entire insert plus the promoter you wish to use.
##*You will need to use the sequence derived orientation of your insert to determine which primers to use to transcribe the desired strand.
##The linear template must be cleaned up before use in IVT.
##*For digests, extract by [[Oneill_Lab:DNA_Extraction#PCI|PCI]] and [[Oneill_Lab:DNA_Extraction#Ethanol_Precipitation|ethanol precipitation]].
##*Clean PCR products with Qiagen PCR Purification column. Add 20 &mu;g ProK and 2 volumes [[Oneill_Lab:Chemicals#ReagentB|ReagentB]]. Incubate at 50&deg;C overnight. The following day extract with PCI and precipitation. Resuspend in 10 &mu;L of MilliQ water.
