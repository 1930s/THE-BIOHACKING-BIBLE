•	Dislodge cells with 1X trypisn/EDTA: 5-10 ml/150 cm2 flat. Incubate 37°C about 5 min.<br> Pipet cells up and down to obtain a uniform suspension.<br>
•	Mix with an equal volume of growth medium to stop trypsination.<br>
•	Spin 1.5-2 k to pellet cells<br>
•	Resuspend in 15ml ice-cold PBS. Spin to pellet (2X)
<br>•	Resuspend in 5ml cold PBS. (If it is known that 5ml is more volume than will ultimately be needed, resuspend the cells in an appropriate volume.)<br>
•	Count cells using a hemocytometer:<br> 
        o	450ul PBS
        o	25ul cell resuspension
        o	25ul Evan’s blue (or Trypan blue)
                __________________________
                  500ul Mix
<br>•	Apply about 25ul to hemocytometer. Count 4 squares having 16 sub squares/ square. Calculate average for the 4 squares.<br>
        o	Calculate: Avg. #cells X 104  X dilution factor (20 here)<br>
        o	=#cells/ml<br>
•	Adjust cell volume with PBS to obtain 1X107 cells/ml<br>
•	Mix 400ul cells with 5-10ug RNA in sterile eppendorf tube. Keep on ice. (Need one 2mm gap cuvette/ electorporation) Electroporate 1 cell sample wo/RNA.<br>
•	Electroporation:<br>
        o	Remove cuvette from ice immediately prior to electroporating. Warm by hand and pulse.<br>
        o	Pulse conditions: 450V (450V setting)
                • 720 ohms (R10)
                • 100uF
                • Pulse length should be about 0.7msec.<br>
•	Pulse twice in succession.<br>
•	Add 15ml growth media and put into 1 T75 flask.<br>
•	Harvest virus (supernatant) at 3+ CPE. Should be between 24-48 hrs.<br>
