==Prepare immunogen==

* 50 ug of antigen
* '''200ul of final injection volume per mice'''
** 100ul of antigen + PBS
** 100ul of adjuvant 
* allow some extra room for dead volumes in syringes, etc (prepare for 4 mice instead of 3, 8 mice instead of 6, etc)

'''NOTE:''' use ''complete'' Freud's adjuvant only in the primary injection. Any booster should be done by ''incomplete'' adjuvant or otherwise the 2ndary response may be lethal.

# load antigen + pbs in an eppendorf
# syringe adjuvant out of bottle (gauge 21 is recommended, nothing much thinner). '''DO NOT MIX''' at this point
#* can put into eppendorf and then pipette to be more precise (allowing sufficient time for the pipette to aspirate the viscous material) or leave in the 3ml syringe.
# load into 3ml syringe using 21g
# connect syringe to 3-way (one screw), making sure the screw side is closed
# connect other syringe
# mix adjuvant + antigen by repeatedly pushing and pulling. (push with one, pull with the other)
# go to mouse room

==Injection==
* prepare your cage
* prepare injection
# push all the immunogen in one of the two 3ml syringes
# screw off the empty 3ml syringe
# loosen the 1ml syringe by moving piston up and down a couple of times
# plug the 1ml syringe, making sure you have a good hold and can apply pressure (there is no screw)
# while holding the 1ml syringe (otherwise it flies away), push immunogen into it from the 3ml syringe
# take the 1ml syringe off and cap with a 25g 5/8 (nothing thinner as the adjuvant does not flow much)
transfer all immunogen emulsion

*immobilize each mice and inject IP.

==Schedule==

*generally, 10 days should pass after primary immunization. longer is fine, shorter (min ~ 7 days) can also work if one needs to rush. Consider that the peak cellular response occurs at days 4-7.
*booster injections can be done as close as 1 wk. from each other
