iGEM Meeting Notes 9/15


<u> Major Lab Goals for Jamboree: </u>
*Random library creation (realistically, given the time constraint this probably won't happen)
**Everyone should attempt, perhaps, as a side project
**Mainly George at the moment, possibly w/ Kevin in near future
*Fec (Shaunak, Ellenor) 
**Test controls (strep, his)
**Dual vector system didn't work (errors in seq?), use high-fidelityu polymerase
*Biobricking
**Fec (Alex)
**AIDA (Perry)
*Test OmpA-C-term insertions (Sammy, Mike)
*Target-quorum control system (Stephanie)


<u>Logistical iGEM things</u>
*Wiki: the one on MIT wiki counts, look at least year's
**Make one webpage that is pretty detailed
*Consider 2 posters
*Stand-in presentation/poster
**Little to no mention of random library, since this was not achieved
***Random library can be discussed as the "moving forward" (process-of-creating) portion
**Focus on results we have now
**Bring out which parts we've made (this needs to happen in any case)
***Slide to show parts available vs new assemblies
**Make this presentation <b> now</b> so we have a fall-back/de-stress element in the days before the Jamboree, when 

we'll also have more schoolwork


<u>Deadlines</u>
*9/22: lunch meeting, polish powerpoint (consolidate, make more clear, add new results, fix graphs)


<u>Team Members' Plans</u>
*George: possibly MCB 91r 
*Sammy: not 91r, possibly 5 hrs/week
*Ellenor and Shaunak: about 4 hrs/week each, probably no 91r
*Alex: no iGEM-related 91r; will potentially stop after Biobricking Fec
*Perry: Job at med school, will have less (no?) time to devote
*Kevin: still figuring out extracurricular commitments
*Stephanie: possibly (??) MCB 91r
