==Overview==
This is a part of the effort to provide a standardized, extensible, scalable and machine-processable interface for the [http://parts.mit.edu/ Registry of Standard Biological Parts]. Semantic Web technologies seem to provide a solution to this problem. The success of developing a Synthetic Biology ontology depends in part on a good definition of the [[Synthetic Biology:Abstraction hierarchy | BioBricks abstraction hierarchy]].
