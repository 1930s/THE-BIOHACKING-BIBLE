My work in the lab revolves around the multitude of human transfer RNA 
sequences. While humans use 51 anticodons (modifications permit them to 
translate all 61 possible codons), annotation of the human genome 
reveals 270 unique sequences of tRNAs. In other words, there are roughly 
five different tRNA sequences associated with each anticodon class. I am 
interested in studying the functional ramifications of these variations 
as well as characterizing human population-level variation in tRNA genes.
