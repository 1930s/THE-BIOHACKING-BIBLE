\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose, Policy, and Scope}
\paragraph{Purpose}

This document constitutes the Chemical Hygiene Plan required by the
U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and regulations of the
U.S. Department of Labor including 29 CFR 1910.1450 ``Occupational
Exposure to Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratories'' (the ``Laboratory
Standard''). The purpose of the Plan is to describe proper practices,
procedures, equipment, and facilities to be followed by employees,
students, visitors, and other personnel working in the \fullDLC(\DLC)
to protect them from potential health and physical hazards presented
by chemicals used in the workplace, and to keep exposures below
specified limits.


\paragraph{Policy and Scope}

It is the policy of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as
represented by the MIT Corporation and the Office of the President) to
provide a safe and healthy workplace in compliance with the U.S.
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and regulations of the U.S.
Department of Labor including the Laboratory Standard referenced
above. The full OSHA Laboratory Standard can be found at
\url{http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p\_id=10106&p\_table=STANDARDS}.

This plan applies to all laboratories in \DLC that are located in the
Stata Center, MIT Building 32, and all personnel who supervise or work
in these labs. The primary applicable labs are located in one
neighborhood of the building in rooms 306, 308, 311, 316, and 322.

\begin{comment}
While not required, non-laboratory areas where hazardous
chemicals are used or stored may be included and subject to this
plan. Special provisions for non-laboratory areas are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:osha_hazard_communication}.  
\end{comment}

\subsection{Plan Organization}

Part I contains information regarding the general administrative
components of this Chemical Hygiene Plan. This part outlines the
policy, purpose, and scope of the plan, and defines the roles and
responsibilities for developing and implementing the
Plan. Requirements for plan preparation and review, training, medical
evaluation, exposure assessment, recordkeeping, inspections and
audits, and overviews of other relevant regulations are detailed in
this part as well.

Part II contains the minimum required precautions and standard
operating procedures for working with laboratory chemicals in MIT
laboratories. These precautions address broad classes of chemicals and
include information and guidance in the following areas:

\begin{itemize}
\item Prior approvals
\item Common chemical hazards
\item Procedures for work with hazardous chemicals
\item Procedures for work with particularly hazardous substances
\item Personal protective equipment
\item Other safety equipment and engineering controls
\item Chemical labeling and storage
\item Chemical waste management
\item Signs and symptoms of chemical exposure
\item Emergency procedures
\item Shipping hazardous and dangerous materials
\end{itemize}

Part III contains standard operating procedures for specialized
materials, procedures, or practices related to chemical use that are
not adequately addressed in Part~II of this plan. A Standard Operating
Procedure (SOP) Template is contained in this part to provide
assistance to laboratory personnel generating specific safety
procedures.

\subsection{MIT EHS Management System}

MIT has designed and implemented a comprehensive and integrated Environment,
Health, and Safety Management System (EHS-MS). A highly collaborative effort
that drew on the leadership and expertise of faculty, researchers, students,
administrators, and staff, the EHS Management System has reshaped how all
members of the MIT community view their environment, health, and safety
responsibilities, carry out MIT's comprehensive and integrated environmental
commitment in their day-to-day activities, and assess MIT's performance
against our goals.

This management system provides better institutional accountability for
achieving and maintaining compliance with federal, state, and local
environment, health and safety regulations in MIT's departments,
laboratories, and centers, while simultaneously retaining the independence
of research and teaching. The EHS-MS also seeks to create a more sustainable
campus by encouraging the incorporation of positive initiatives into
activities, such as reducing wastes and toxics, preventing pollution, and
conserving and reusing resources. One of the defining features of MIT's
EHS-MS is to integrate regulatory compliance with positive initiatives and
educational programs in a decentralized academic research setting.

This Chemical Hygiene Plan is an integral component of the EHS-MS. It
is an administrative tool that provides for the establishment of safe
and sound workplace practices in the laboratory, and ensures the
Institutes regulatory compliance with the OSHA Laboratory Standard, 29
CFR 1910.1450. The Chemical Hygiene Plan incorporates and advances
core components of the EHS-MS, such as clarifying roles and
responsibilities, outlining training requirements, identifying
chemical risks, and documenting safe operating procedures to mitigate
those risks. More information on the EHS Management System can be
found at \url{http://web.mit.edu/environment/ehs/ehs_management.shtml}

\section{Roles And Responsibilities}

An essential component of any chemical safety program is to clearly
articulate and clarify the different roles and responsibilities of all the
stakeholders who work or visit in areas where chemicals are present.
Clarifying roles and responsibilities for implementing the Chemical Hygiene
Plan will establish accountability, streamline processes, enhance safety,
and avoid confusion and questions in meeting the Plans objectives.

plan meets requirements set forth in 29 CFR 1910.1450. Assistance in
creating the Chemical Hygiene Plan is provided by the MIT EHS Team.

\subsection{Initial Plan Approval}

The Chemical Hygiene Officer, is responsible for assuring that the
chemical hygiene plan is approved by EHS Office Industrial Hygiene
Program (IHP).  Once the CHO completes the initial plan, they must
submit the plan to IHP for a final review. An IHP representative will
review the plan against the requirements of the OSHA standard, the EHS
Office, and the EHS Management System, and will provide comments when
needed. The CHO must incorporate comments and resubmit the plan for
final approval. When a plan meets all requirements, the IHP will
provide a letter of approval to the CHO. The CHO must assure the plan

changes that must be incorporated into the plan due to changes in EHS
operations, the MIT EHS Management System, or changes in regulatory
requirements.

The Chemical Hygiene Officer will review, update, and submit the plan,
with any changes required, to the EHS Office by the deadline specified
by the IHP. The CHO should make sure that the plan update factors in
changes in operations as well as the changes requested by the IHP.

The IHP will review the plan and provide the CHO comments, when needed. When
comments are received, the CHO must incorporate them, and resubmit the plan.
Once the IHP considers the plan complete, they will provide a letter of
approval to the CHO.

Upon receipt of the letter of approval, the plan is considered final for the
year. The Chemical Hygiene Officer will see that the Chemical Hygiene Plan
and updates are distributed to or made available to those who are affected
by it. One copy of the Chemical Hygiene Plan and all updates will be
provided electronically to MIT EHS for reference use, and to facilitate the
annual update process.

\section{Training and Information}

MIT will provide laboratory personnel with information and training to
ensure that they are apprised of the hazards of the chemicals present in
their work area. The purpose of information and training is to ensure that
all individuals at risk are adequately informed about the work being
performed in the laboratory, associated hazards and actions to be taken to
protect themselves during normal operations, as well as emergencies.

\subsection{General Requirements}

{\em Anyone who has not met all training requirements is not allowed
to be in a laboratory area unaccompanied by trained lab personnel.}

\subsubsection{Training Requirements}
\label{sec:lab_training}

Chemical hygiene training requirements are detailed in the EHS-MS
training system (see
\url{http://web.mit.edu/environment/training}). The following 4
components are required if you indicate in the Training Needs
Assessment within the training system that you use potentially
hazardous chemicals in a laboratory or are a Principal Investigator or
Supervisor for those who use potentially hazardous chemicals in a
laboratory.

\begin{enumerate}
\item  
{\bf General Chemical Hygiene Training} -- can be taken as a web-based
course or taken by attending a class offered by the EHS
Office. Required once only before beginning work with potentially
hazardous chemicals in a laboratory.


\item
{\bf Read the Chemical Hygiene Plan} -- see your EHS Representative if
you do not know where to find this. Sign-off required once only before
beginning work with potentially hazardous chemicals in a laboratory.

\item
{\bf Lab specific chemical hygiene training} -- provided by the
Principal Investigator or his or her designee on lab specific chemical
hazards.  Required before beginning work with potentially hazardous
chemicals in a laboratory and annually thereafter (usually within a
lab group meeting). The topics covered will depend, in part, on the
nature of the lab and research being done. However, some suggested
topics are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Information about physical and health hazards of chemicals used
in the lab.  Many lab groups use too many chemicals to discuss each
one individually, so a grouping of chemicals by hazard type may be
used.

\item Lab specific rules for the use of fume hoods.

\item Information about location, use, and maintenance of personal
protective equipment, including designation of who is responsible for
assuring that a stock of this equipment is maintained.

\item Information about location of emergency response equipment, such
as, eyewash, safety showers, spill supplies, fire extinguishers, etc.

\item Procedures established for labeling materials.

\item Information on lab procedures for storing materials.

\item Information on lab specific waste management practices.

\item You will be asked to sign a roster indicating your attendance.
\end{enumerate}

\item
{\bf Managing Hazardous Waste} -- can be taken as a web-based course
or taken by attending a class offered by the EHS Office. Required
before beginning work with potentially hazardous chemicals and
annually thereafter.

\end{enumerate}



\subsubsection{Information Requirements}

Information that must be provided or made available to laboratory personnel
include:
\begin{itemize}

\item A copy of the OSHA Lab Standard. This information also can be
found from the OSHA web site.

\item The location and availability of the Chemical Hygiene Plan.

\item The Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) for OSHA-regulated
substances and the AGCIH Threshold Limit Values (TLVs) for hazardous
substances not given OSHA PELs.

\item Signs and symptoms associated with exposure to hazardous
substances used in the laboratory. General information is provided in
Section~\ref{sec:symptoms}.

\item The location and availability of known reference materials on
hazards, safe handling, storage and disposal of hazardous chemicals
found in the laboratory.
\end{itemize}

Hard copies of available safety information, including a copy of this
chemical hygiene plan, will be located on the shelves in the area of
32-311. A first aid kit exists in the cabinet outside room 32-322.

\subsection{Chemical Safety Information Sources}

There are numerous sources of chemical safety information. These
sources include:

\begin{itemize} 
\item Chemical Container Labels
\item Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) or Laboratory Chemical Safety
Summaries (LCSS)
\item Laboratory Signs
\item Health and Safety Reference Literature
\end{itemize}

In addition, your lab supervisor, Chemical Hygiene Officer, and EHS
Office staff are available to provide safety information. Safety
information sources are discussed in greater detail below.

\subsection{Chemical Container Labels}

Chemical container labels are a good resource for information on chemical
hazards. All containers of hazardous chemicals must have labels attached.
Labels on purchased chemicals must include:

\begin{itemize}
\item The common name of the chemical;

\item The name, address and telephone number of the company
responsible for the product; and

\item An appropriate hazard warning.
\end{itemize}

The warning may be a single word (i.e. Danger, Caution, Warning) or may
identify the primary hazard both physical (i.e. water reactive, flammable,
or explosive) and health (i.e. carcinogen, corrosive or irritant).

Most labels provide additional safety information to help workers protect
themselves from the substance. This information may include protective
measures and/or protective clothing to be used, first aid instructions,
storage information and emergency procedures.

Laboratory personnel are responsible for:
\begin{itemize}
\item Inspecting incoming containers to be sure that they are labeled
with the information outlined above.

\item Reading the container label each time a newly purchased chemical
is used. It is possible that the manufacturer may have added new
hazard information or reformulated the product since the last
purchase.

\item Ensuring that chemical container labels are not removed or
defaced, except when containers are empty.

\item Labeling any secondary containers used in the laboratory, to
prevent unknown chemicals or inadvertent reaction.

\item Verifying that chemical waste containers have complete and
accurate chemical waste labels.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs)}

Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) are documents, prepared by chemical
manufacturers that describe the physical and chemical characteristics of
hazardous chemicals; provide information about the chemicals physical and
chemical hazards; and list the means for controlling those hazards. MSDSs
also provide information about first aid, emergency procedures, waste
disposal and recommended exposure limits.

An MSDS should be reviewed before beginning work with a chemical to
determine proper use and safety precautions. Once a chemical is present in
the lab, the MSDS should be either book marked electronically or a hard copy
kept on hand for reference, in case of emergencies. Information required by
OSHA to be on an MSDS include:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
Product Identity & Reactivity Hazards\\
Hazardous Ingredients & Spill Clean-UP\\
Physical/Chemical Properties & Protective Equipment\\
Fire and Explosion Hazards & Special Precautions\\
Health Hazards
\end{tabular}

MSDSs and similar documentation can be obtained from a variety of
sources as outlined below:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf The Internet}. The EHS Office has compiled a list of links
to sites that contain MSDSs. This list can be accessed at
\url{http://web.mit.edu/environment/ehs/topic/msds.html}.

\item {\bf Laboratory Chemical Safety Summaries (LCSS)}. The LCSSs
provide concise critical discussions of the toxicity, flammability,
reactivity, and explosibility of 88 chemicals commonly used in
scientific research laboratories. These are particularly useful as
they address laboratory use of chemicals. They are available from the
Howard Hughes Medical Institute website at
\url{http://hhmi.org/research/labsafe/overview.html}.

\item {\bf Chemical Manufacturer}. A request may be made directly to
the chemical manufacturer or supplier. This is often the best source
for products or mixtures to determine what hazardous ingredients are
contained in the formulation.

\item {\bf EHS Office}. A comprehensive file of MSDS's for common
chemicals that are in use at MIT or have been used at MIT is available
through the EHS Office on the fourth floor of Building N52. They can
be reached at 2-EHSS (2-3477).
\end{itemize}

Please contact the EHS Office if you need assistance help in interpreting
MSDS information.

\subsection{Laboratory Emergency Contact Signs}

Each laboratory using hazardous materials at the Institute is required
to post a standardized sign on the entry door containing emergency
contact information on the key responsible parties for the
laboratory. This includes information on the department, lab, or
center; PI/Supervisor; EHS Representative; EHS Coordinator; and the
Department of Facilities. These signs are commonly called {\em
Emergency Green Cards}, and can be generated only by the EHS Office or
the DLC EHS Coordinators.

In addition, all laboratories must post appropriate laboratory entrance
precautionary signs if they are using biological, radiological, laser, or
other specialized hazards. These signs can be obtained by contacting the EHS
Office.


\subsection{Health and Safety Reference Literature}

The EHS Office maintains a library of reference materials addressing
environment, health and safety issues. These references include applicable
exposure standards and recommended exposure levels, as well as copies of the
OSHA Lab Standard and its Appendices. These materials, as well as additional
health and safety references, may be reviewed by visiting the EHS Office
located on the fourth floor of Building N52.



\section{Medical Evaluation and Surveillance}

\subsection{Medical Evaluation}

Employees or students who wish to discuss occupationally-related medical
issues with the MIT Medical Department, Occupational Medicine Service may do
so. During this medical evaluation, the clinician will determine if a
medical examination is necessary. Medical evaluations and examinations may
be arranged by contacting the Medical Department, Occupational Medicine
Service at 253-8552.


\subsubsection{When a Medical Evaluation May be Necessary}

Any employee who exhibits adverse health effects from an exposure as a
result of MIT-related research or work should report to the Medical
Department immediately for a medical evaluation.

Employees or students who work with hazardous materials are entitled to a
medical evaluation when any of the following conditions occur:

\begin{itemize}
\item the individual develops signs/symptoms associated with hazardous
chemicals to which they were exposed;

\item exposure monitoring results are routinely above action level or
PEL (permissible exposure limit) for a substance for which there are
monitoring/medical surveillance requirements; or

\item a spill, leak, explosion or other incident creates a likelihood
of exposure.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Information to Provide to the Clinician}

At the time of the medical evaluation, the following information shall be
provided to the clinician:

\begin{itemize}
\item identity of the hazardous chemicals to which the individual may
have been exposed;
\item description of the conditions under which the exposure occurred;

\item a description of the signs and symptoms of exposure, if any; and

\item where the exposure involves a new chemical, a copy of the
chemical information sheet (MSDS, or Material Safety Data Sheet) shall
be provided as well.
\end{itemize}

If a Supervisor's Report of Occupational Injury or Illness has been
completed, the Supervisor will provide the information above. In
instances where time does not permit for the Supervisors report to be
completed, the employee or individual assisting the employee to the
Medical Department will provide the information.

\subsubsection{Clinician's Written Opinion}

The MIT Medical Department and the Industrial Hygiene Program within
the Environment, Health, and Safety Office have a collaborative
relationship in dealing with chemical and other work-related exposures
that may result in the need for medical care.  This collaborative
relationship includes protecting patient information while ensuring
that supervisors receive the information necessary to ensure that an
individual's return to work following medical treatment for a
work-related exposure does not compromise the patient's health.

All patient medical information is protected by law and is considered
strictly confidential. A patient, however, is entitled to view his/her
medical record. When a work-related exposure has occurred that results in
medical examination and/or treatment, the Medical Department will notify the
supervisor of the incident, along with any recommended restrictions on work
activity.


\subsubsection{Additional Steps to be Taken}

MIT requires the Supervisors Report of Occupational Injury and Illness
to be completed within 24 hours, when a spill or other accident
triggers a medical evaluation or examination. The report, to be
completed by the Supervisor, is available online at:
\url{http://web.mit.edu/environment/ehs/topic/accident.html}.

\subsection{Medical Surveillance}

Medical surveillance is the process of using medical exams and/or biological
monitoring to determine potential changes in health as a result of a
hazardous chemical or other exposure. Certain OSHA standards require a
clinician evaluation as part of medical surveillance. Medical surveillance
is required when initial monitoring reveals exposure levels that exceed
levels (called action levels) allowed under OSHA standards. MIT Medical
Department provides medical surveillance services. If you expect that your
work will involve a hazardous exposure that can not be adequately controlled
by administrative or engineered measures, a baseline exam is advised before
beginning work. That baseline is compared against follow up exams to
determine any changes in health that may have resulted from exposure to the
hazard. In addition, medical surveillance is offered to employees or
students who are routinely exposed to certain hazards. Examples of hazards
that are monitored through the medical surveillance program include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Asbestos
\item Beryllium
\item Noise (Hearing Loss)
\end{itemize}


This is not a full list of hazards for which medical surveillance is
available. Individuals with questions pertaining to occupational hazards and
the possible need for medical surveillance are encouraged to contact the
Medical Department. The Medical Department in turn works collaboratively
with the EHS Office to determine the need for and extent of medical
surveillance.


\subsubsection{Enrollment in Medical Surveillance}

For those individuals whose work involves exposures with potential medical
surveillance requirements, it is the responsibility of supervisors to
identify new employees/students who are exposed to hazards, and to provide
names, work addresses, and MIT Identification Numbers (MIT ID) to the EHS
Office. Individuals not otherwise identified but who believe that they incur
hazardous exposures, or believe they may have been inadvertently omitted,
may self-enroll by dialing 253-1740. Supervisors who believe that
individuals have been inadvertently omitted from medical surveillance may
also contact this number. Finally, the EHS Office may identify individuals
or populations of individuals at risk and invite their participation.


More information on Medical Consultation, Evaluation, and Surveillance may
be obtained from the Medical Departments Occupational Medicine webpage at
\url{http://web.mit.edu/medical/services/s-occupational.html}.

\section{Exposure Assessment}

\subsection{Exposure Assessment (Monitoring \& Reporting)}

The EHS Office Industrial Hygiene Program provides exposure assessment
services to the Institute community. Exposure assessments are measurements
of air contaminants, noise levels, or other health hazards such as heat
stress to determine if they are within limits that are considered safe for
routine occupational exposure. Any employee who believes s/he has had an
exposure should contact the Chemical Hygiene Officer or the Industrial
Hygiene Program (2-3477) for evaluation. In addition, anyone with a reason
to believe that exposure levels for a substance routinely exceed the action
level, or in the absence of an action level the PEL, may request exposure
monitoring. Monitoring may be requested at any time, however, the Chemical
Hygiene Officer must be notified of monitoring requests. The Industrial
Hygiene Program will conduct, or arrange to have conducted, exposure
monitoring.

If the initial monitoring reveals an employee exposure over the action level
(or the PEL) for a hazard for which OSHA has developed a specific standard
(e.g. lead), the exposure monitoring provisions of that standard, including
medical surveillance, shall be followed. It will be the responsibility of
the Principal Investigator/Supervisor to insure that necessary periodic
monitoring requirements are met.

Within 15 working days after the receipt of any monitoring results, the
Industrial Hygiene Program will notify the employee or student of the
results in writing, either individually or by posting results in an
appropriate location that is accessible to employees. In addition, the
results of any personal air sampling conducted will be given to the
individual and a copy kept in the Industrial Hygiene Office's records.

The Industrial Hygiene Program and the Chemical Hygiene Officer will
establish and maintain for each employee an accurate record of any
measurements taken to monitor exposures. Records, including those from
monitoring provided by other qualified services, will be managed in
accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.1020, Access to Employee Exposure
and Medical Records.


\section{Workplace Hazards Policy}

It is MIT policy that employees and students who may be exposed to hazards
on the job should be informed of the nature of the hazards and how to
protect themselves.

Work place hazards may potentially affect the reproductive health of both
male and female employees if proper procedures and controls are not used. To
evaluate any potential concerns about work and reproductive health, an
employee has multiple resources within MIT to assist him or her.


The MIT Medical Department has on staff an occupational health physician and
occupational health nurse. They are available for consultation about
reproductive health concerns related to work exposure at no cost to the MIT
community. Industrial hygienists, health physicists, and microbiologists are
available to evaluate an Institute laboratory or workplace for reproductive
hazards. Any employee or student can call the Medical Department for a
medical consultation and EHS for a workplace evaluation. All medical
evaluations are kept strictly confidential and issues of confidentiality are
considered when the decision about worksite evaluation is made.

Employees and students should be informed that at any time they may make an
appointment to see an occupational health physician at MIT Medical
Department at no charge. If they prefer to see them before a worksite
evaluation, that is acceptable.

If the workplace or laboratory involves chemicals, the Industrial Hygiene
Program will evaluate the worksite as follows: an industrial hygienist will
visit the workplace and talk with the concerned employee or student. A list
of all chemicals in use and the procedures in which they are used will be
generated. A review of the scientific literature for reproductive hazards of
the chemicals will be conducted and reviewed by the occupational health
physician. If warranted, any exposure controls such as local exhaust
ventilation or personal protective equipment will be evaluated. Air sampling
may be conducted to ensure that if there is any exposure, it is below safe
levels.

In addition to chemical exposures, IHP will also evaluate other workplace
factors that may affect reproductive health, including heat stress, noise,
and ergonomic stresses of the job. Prolonged standing, bending, lifting can
have an impact on pregnancy outcomes; in addition, carpal tunnel syndrome is
2.5 times more prevalent in pregnant women so that careful ergonomic
evaluation of job activities are important. If the employee works with
radioisotopes or ionizing radiation, the Radiation Protection Program will
be contacted for an evaluation. If certain occupational infections
(hepatitis, HIV, toxoplasmosis-rubella-cytomegalovirus-herpes) are a source
of concern, the Biosafety Program will be contacted for evaluation and
infection control methods.

Though there is no formal written Personnel Policy for temporary change of
jobs should employees be concerned about reproductive hazards, Departments,
the Personnel Department, and EMS work together to provide safe work for
pregnant workers. Pregnant employees with illness or disabilities are
covered under regular MIT sick leave and disability policies.

\section{Recordkeeping}

\subsection{Exposure Evaluation}

The Industrial Hygiene Program and the Chemical Hygiene Officer will
establish and maintain an accurate record of any measurements taken to
monitor exposures. Records, including those from monitoring provided by
other qualified services, will be managed in accordance with OSHA standard
29 CFR 1910.1020, Access to Employee Exposure and Medical Records.

\subsection{Medical Consultation and Examination}

Results of medical consultations and examinations will be kept by the MIT
Medical Department for a length of time specified by the appropriate medical
records standard. This time will be at least the term of employment plus 30
years as required by OSHA.

\subsection{Training}

The PI or designee should keep a copy of the outline of the topics covered
in Lab Specific Chemical Hygiene Training. The roster or lists of
researchers who have completed the lab specific training and read the
chemical hygiene plan, must be submitted to the EHS Coordinator. These
training records are then entered into the EHS-MS central training records
database. When an employee or student leaves the Institute, their training
records are moved into an archive training database. Training records are
kept for 30 years after an employee or student leaves the Institute.

\subsection{Fume Hood Monitoring}

Data on annual fume hood monitoring will be kept by the EHS Office. Fume
hood monitoring data are considered maintenance records and as such the raw
data will be kept for one year and summary data for 5 years.

\subsection{Inspection Reports}

A copy of the most recent Level II. {\em Laboratory Inspection
Checklist} and {\em PI Inspection Report}, as outlined below, should
always be maintained locally within the DLC. An additional copy will
be maintained centrally by the EHS Office.


\subsection{Laboratory-Specific Policies and SOPs}

If standard operating procedures (SOPs) are developed in addition to
the SOPs contained in Part~II of this Chemical Hygiene Plan, they may
be included in Part~III of this Chemical Hygiene Plan and a copy
maintained in the laboratory, accessible to laboratory personnel.

\subsection{MSDSs for New Materials}

If your laboratory operations generate new materials for which
existing Material Data Safety Sheets do not adequately address, an
MSDS-type document must be written and maintained in the laboratory
with the laboratory's other MSDSs.


\section{Laboratory Inspections and Audits}
\label{sec:inspections}

\subsection{Inspections}
As a component of the MIT Environment, Health, and Safety Management System
(EHS-MS), the Institute has implemented a framework for conducting
laboratory/work space inspections and audits to determine laboratory/work
space-specific compliance with environmental, health, and safety policies,
laws, and regulations. In addition to laboratory chemical hygiene practices,
the EHS-MS inspections examine a broad spectrum of areas including postings,
documentation and training, safety equipment, laboratory/shop protocol,
waste, and satellite accumulation areas (SAA).

The purpose of the inspection and audit system is to assist the Institute
and laboratories in maintaining a safe work and study environment, ensuring
compliance with regulations, identifying the locations where training or
retraining is needed, and to fulfill MITs commitment to environment, health
and safety stewardship. This program will satisfy the DLC requirements for
chemical hygiene inspections.

The Chemical Hygiene Officer and EHS Coordinator will assist with the
inspections, as noted below. The Industrial Hygiene Program is available to
the Chemical Hygiene Officer and EHS Coordinator in the inspection process
and in all related matters.

The MIT EHS-MS requires three levels of inspection and audit that must be
implemented across the Institute:

\subsubsection{Level I Inspection}

{\em Individual laboratory/work space compliance self-inspection.}
This is to be conducted by the PI or EHS Representative on a weekly
basis to reinforce training and measure compliance. Record-keeping
will be optional, but may be required if there are repeated compliance
issues. Inspection questions and guidance material for these Level I
inspections can be obtained from the EHS website. It is important that
action is taken to correct problems found during these inspections. If
a problem cannot be corrected by the PI/Supervisor for any reason, the
problem should be reported to the EHS Coordinator for follow-up.


\subsubsection{Level II Inspection}

{\em DLC-wide compliance inspection of all lab/work spaces where
potentially hazardous materials are stored and used.}  This inspection
is to be conducted by the EHS Coordinator and the DLC EHS Committee,
or other designated personnel, twice annually, with at least one
inspection jointly conducted by the EHS Office Lead Contact and DLC
personnel. Records of these inspections will be kept
centrally. Inspection questions and guidance material for these Level
II inspections can be obtained from the EHS website.

Once the inspection is complete, the PI/Supervisor will receive a
report and must act to correct the problems found and then submit, in
writing to the CHO and EHS Coordinator, the actions taken to resolve
the problems. If the PI/Supervisor cannot correct a problem for any
reason, he/she must notify the CHO and the EHS Coordinator.


\subsubsection{Level III Audit}

{\em System implementation and operation audit by MIT.} This audit is
arranged by the EHS Office and will be carried out by the MIT Audit
Division and/or outside consultants. These audits will be conducted at
least once every two years, and may or may not impact all DLCs. The
purpose of these audits is to evaluate the EHS Management
System. Generally, follow-up will not involve a specific
PI/Supervisor.

\subsection{Compliance and Enforcement}

If a PI/Supervisor does not take appropriate action to address problems
noted during inspection or audits, he/she may be subject to compliance and
enforcement action. Issues of non-compliance will be taken to the DLC EHS
Committee for recommendations regarding disciplinary action. The EHS
Committee will provide recommendations to the Department Head for action.
Deliberate failure to comply that results in serious jeopardy to personnel
safety and health or the environment may result in loss of laboratory
privileges.

A framework for establishing consequences for poor EHS performance and
incentives for promoting best management practices has been adopted by
the Institute.

\section{OSHA Hazard Communication Standard}
\label{sec:osha_hazard_communication}

This Plan also applies to the non-laboratory operations in \DLC where
hazardous chemicals are used.  All components of this plan applicable
to laboratory areas apply to these non-laboratory areas. Additional
requirements or options for these non-laboratory areas are provided
below.

Added responsibilities for PIs/Supervisors. In addition to their
responsibilities noted in Section~\ref{sec:pi}, PIs/Supervisors for
the non-laboratory areas shall:

\begin{itemize}
\item  
Assure a list of all hazardous chemicals used in the non-laboratory area is
compiled. The list shall include chemical or product name (as found on the
label), manufacturer, location of use or storage, and maximum quantity
likely to be present at one time during the year. This list must be updated
annually, and a copy of the old list submitted to the EHS Office for
archiving.

\item Assure that for each chemical on the list, there is a copy of an
MSDS in a notebook readily accessible to all personnel using the
chemical. This notebook should be updated annually when the list is
updated.

\item Assure all personnel are informed of the chemical list and the
MSDS notebook during work area specific training.

\end{itemize}

Employees and students working in these areas may choose to take General
Chemical Safety for laboratories or General HAZCOM training for
non-laboratory areas.

All potentially hazardous chemicals transferred from their original
container to a second container must be labeled with the chemical name and
the principal hazard. 
  
\end{comment}

\section{Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)}

The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) is a set of EPA regulations
(40 CFR 700-799) designed to review new chemicals for environmental
and health risks before they are widely distributed in commerce. A New
Chemical is a substance that is not currently on the {\em TSCA
Inventory}. The TSCA regulations also provide EPA with the power to
restrict or ban the circulation of chemicals currently in commerce
that are known to cause harm to the environment or human health
(e.g. PCBs and asbestos).

Though TSCA is most widely understood and used among industrial and
manufacturing facilities, EPA has begun looking at universities to determine
their compliance with TSCA, specifically the syntesis of new chemicals. The
sections of TSCA of specific concern to MIT include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Import Notification (Section~13)
\item Export Notification (Section~12b)
\item Pre-Manufacture Notices (Section~5) --- Research and Development exemption
\item Allegations of Adverse Reactions (Section~8c) and Notice of Substantial Risk
(Section~8e)
\end{itemize}

DLCs need to determine whether or not a chemical substance is covered under
TSCA if there are plans to:
\begin{itemize}
\item import a chemical substance;
\item export a chemical substance;
\item synthesize a chemical substance, in which case you need to
determine whether that chemical substance is currently in commerce. If
the chemical is not currently in commerce, you need to determine
whether it is regulated by another agency; if it isn't, the substance
is regulated under TSCA. New chemicals have additional requirements
under TSCA.
\item transfer a chemical substance to another lab outside your own
(on campus or to another facility in the US) you need to determine if
the chemical substance is regulated under TSCA. If it is, and little
to nothing is known about the environmental and/or health effects of
that chemical substance, then TSCA requires you to warn other users of
that fact. Labeling requirements for containers also apply.
\end{itemize}

{\em Transfers/Shipments of Chemicals within the US and Chemical
Information Sheets} for risk notification are also critical components
of the program.  These last two requirements also dovetail with the
hazard communication requirements of the OSHA Laboratory Standard, 29
CFR 1910.1450 (Chemical Hygiene Plan) and DOT shipping requirements
for dangerous and hazardous goods, 49 CFR 173-179.


Specific instructions and forms for developing a TSCA compliance file
are available from the EHS Office. If you have specific questions on
how your project may be affected by TSCA, please contact the Chemical
Hygiene Officer or EHS Coordinator or contact the EHS Office at
2-3477.

\part{General Chemical Safety}

\section{Chemical Safety Overview}

Part II of this Chemical Hygiene Plan provides MIT laboratory
personnel with information regarding hazardous chemicals that may be
present in the laboratory and appropriate work practices, procedures
and controls to protect laboratory workers from those hazards.

Hazardous chemicals can cause harm when they enter the body in
sufficient amounts via inhalation, ingestion, injection, or skin
absorption. Harmful effects can also occur by eye or skin contact
alone. The nature of the hazardous chemical and the routes by which it
enters or contacts the body determine the type of controls that are
needed.  

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and other
organizations have set occupational exposure limits on airborne
chemical exposure. Keeping exposures below these limits is generally
believed to protect employees and students. Permissible Exposure
Limits (PELs) set by OSHA are at
\url{http://www.osha-slc.gov/SLTC/pel/index.html}. Threshold Limit
Values (TLVs) established by the American Conference of Governmental
Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) can be obtained from the EHS office or
purchased at \url{http://www.acgih.org/home.htm}. Regardless of the
established exposure limit for a particular chemical, all laboratory
workers should take steps to minimize chemical exposure via all routes
of entry.

OSHA recognizes that some classes of chemical substances pose a
greater health and safety risk than others. To differentiate this
different risk characteristic, OSHA identifies two categories of
hazardous chemicals: hazardous chemicals and particularly hazardous
substances. Particularly hazardous substances (PHSs) is a subset of
hazardous chemicals that is regulated more stringently because they
have been deemed to pose a substantially greater risk. Because of
this, OSHA requires additional precautions and procedures be
undertaken when particularly hazardous substances are used in the
laboratory. This Chemical Hygiene Plan provides two sets of standard
operating procedures, one for hazardous chemicals
(Section~\ref{sec:hazardous}) and one for particularly hazardous
substances (Section~\ref{sec:particularly_hazardous}).

Four methods are used to limit chemical exposure for all types of
chemicals:
\begin{itemize}
\item Chemical elimination or substitution;
\item Administrative controls;
\item Engineering controls; and
\item Personal protective equipment (PPE).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Chemical Elimination or Substitution}

The first step in evaluating a new experiment, process or operation is to
investigate the possibility of eliminating the use of hazardous materials or
substituting a less hazardous material. For example, instead of using an
organic solvent or chromic acid based material for washing glassware, one
should substitute an aqueous based detergent. Aromatic compounds (i.e.,
benzene) and chlorinated hydrocarbons (i.e., methylene chloride) in some
experiments should be replaced with aliphatic compounds or nonchlorinated
hydrocarbons, if possible.

The particular process, experiment or operation may also be modified to
reduce the quantity of the hazardous material(s) necessary or limit the
potential emission release rate or exposure time. For example, the use of
microscale techniques may be applicable in measuring boiling points of a
material. Another example is the substitution of closed systems for open
vessels. The use of a secondary containment device such as a pan can be
helpful in preventing or minimizing the effects of chemical spills.

The Industrial Hygiene Program (2-3477) should be consulted for advice.

\subsection{Administrative Controls}

Administrative controls are policies and procedures for minimizing
inhalation and physical contact exposures. This Chemical Hygiene Plan is the
master administrative control. Specific administrative controls include:

\begin{itemize}
\item General safety procedures;
\item Chemical use and procedure approval and/or review.
\item Exposure monitoring and signage;
\item Labeling;
\item Environment, health and safety training, and information
dissemination;
\item Laboratory inspections by laboratory workers and supervisors;
and
\item Record keeping.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Engineering Controls}

Properly exhausted fume hoods, other local exhaust ventilation, glove boxes
and other special purpose hoods must be used when there is a likelihood of
excessive exposure to air contaminants generated by laboratory activity.
Used in conjunction with good work practices, properly designed and operated
exhaust ventilation is effective in minimizing inhalation exposure.

\subsection{Personal Protective Equipment}

The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is necessary when feasible
engineering and administrative controls are unavailable or if there is a
need to supplement those controls. The following types of PPE are used to
minimize inhalation and physical contact exposures:
\begin{itemize}
\item Eye and face protection: safety glasses, face shields, and
  chemical splash goggles.
\item Protective clothing: lab coats, aprons and arm covers.
\end{itemize}

More detailed information on PPE is outlined below in
Section~\ref{sec:ppe}.

\subsection{General Principles}

To provide for the safety of the MIT community and to protect MIT and
surrounding property from damage, the following general principles apply to
all faculty, staff and students performing work in laboratories:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Perform Hazard Assessment:} Prior to initiation of new
experiments or procedures, assessment of potential hazards must be
performed. Appropriate protective measures, including personal
protective equipment and engineering controls, must be identified and
implemented. Laboratories should develop process- or
experiment-specific guidelines and protective procedures.

\item {\bf Minimize Chemical Exposures:} Since few laboratory
chemicals are without hazards, general precautions for chemical
handling, storage and disposal should be implemented as outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:hazardous} in all laboratories. Use of less hazardous
materials, implementation of engineering controls whenever feasible,
and use of personal protective equipment to avoid skin contact with or
inhalation of chemicals is encouraged.

\item {\bf Avoid Underestimation of Risk:} Even for substances with no
known significant hazard, exposure should be minimized. For work with
particularly hazardous substances, special precautions must be taken
as outlined in Section~\ref{sec:particularly_hazardous}. It should
always be assumed that the toxicity of a mixture would be more toxic
than its most toxic component. All substances of unknown toxicity
should be considered toxic.

\item {\bf Provide Adequate Ventilation:} The best way to prevent
exposure to airborne substances is to prevent their escape into the
working atmosphere by using chemical fume hoods or other ventilation
devices.

\item {\bf Observe Established Standards:} The permissible exposure
limits and threshold limit values established by OSHA and other
organizations should be observed.  Where a regulatory standard does
not exist, other recognized exposure limits should be followed.

\item {\bf Follow the Chemical Hygiene Plan:} Procedures described in
this Chemical Hygiene Plan are designed to minimize or prevent
exposure to hazardous chemicals. Implementation of the CHP should be a
regular, continuing effort.

\item {\bf Be Prepared for Accidents.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Standard Operating Procedures}
\label{sec:sops}

A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is a written set of instructions
or guidelines that detail the uniform procedures to be followed
routinely when carrying out a particular activity. The development and
implementation of standard operating procedures for critical
activities is a core component of promoting excellence in a laboratory
and for ensuring a safe, healthy, and environmentally sound
workplace. For these reasons, the development of SOPs is an essential
administrative tool to be used in the laboratory.

Not only are SOPs good practice, they are also required by the federal
laws governing laboratory safety practices. The OSHA Laboratory
Standard requires laboratories to have standard operating procedures
that ensure the safe use of chemicals.

This Chemical Hygiene Plan contains standard operating procedures for
the safe use of two categories of chemicals: hazardous chemicals, and
particularly hazardous substances (PHS). These two sets of standard
operating procedures are contained in
Sections~\ref{sec:hazardous} and
\ref{sec:particularly_hazardous} respectively. These general safety
procedures are designed to ensure basic levels of staff health and
safety in the laboratory, for routine and common practices, uses, and
chemicals.

The OSHA Laboratory Standard requires that laboratories develop
additional written standard operating procedures if the general SOPs
of this Plan DO NOT adequately ensure the protection of personal
health and safety, and the environment. If a particular chemical,
activity, or usage falls outside of the general guidelines provided
here, the laboratory must prepare written procedures that mitigate
environment, health and safety risks. This is particularly applicable
if a procedure requires detailed and specific guidance to avoid
dangerous exposure or consequences. SOPs must be developed prior to
initiating any of the particularly hazardous procedures.

Guidelines and a template for preparing SOPs for these specialized,
unique and/or particularly hazardous chemicals, practices, and uses
are contained in Part III. of this Plan. A copy of all SOPs developed
must be located in the laboratory spaces and available to all people
in the laboratory. It is recommended that all additional SOPs be
included in Part III of this Chemical Hygiene Plan.

\section{Prior Approvals and Procurement}

\subsection{DLC-Based Prior Approvals}
\label{sec:dlc_approval}

Prior approvals are required before work with certain hazardous
materials in \DLC can commence.  Researchers are required to obtain
prior approval from the EHS Committee for work with chemicals in the
following list:

{\em Restricted Chemicals Requiring Prior Approval}
\begin{itemize}
\item hydrofluoric acid
\item sodium azide
\item ether
\item PMSF
\item formaldehyde
\item benzene
\item toluene
\item xylene
\item halogenated solvents
\item strong acids or bases
\end{itemize}

Researchers intending to work with any of these restricted chemicals
must prepare a plan to ensure for safe use including the development
of standard operating procedures. Subsequently, these SOPs should be
included in Part III of this Chemical Hygiene Plan and kept on file
in the laboratory.


\subsection{MIT-Wide Prior Approvals}

The MIT Procurement Department through its Purchasing Policies and
Procedures has established Institute-wide restrictions on the purchase
of certain hazardous materials. These materials require pre-approval
by authorized MIT agents prior to purchase. These materials include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Radioactive Materials
\item Controlled Substances, such as drugs
\item Hypodermic Needles and Syringes
\item Ethyl Alcohol
\item Certain Poisons
\item Nitrous Oxide Gas
\item Explosives
\item Liquid Petroleum Gases
\item Certain Biological Materials
\end{itemize}

Detailed information on the purchase of these materials can be found on the
Procurement Departments website at
\url{http://web.mit.edu/purchasing/pol&proced/4.1.pdf}. For more information
on the registration and use of restricted biological materials, please visit
the EHS Office website.


\subsection{Purchase of Large Chemical Quantities}

MIT discourages the practice of bulk ordering of chemicals that reduces the
chemical cost per unit volume. Although bulk orders can save individual DLCs
money in the short-term, in the long run, the cost of disposal of unused
chemicals can far outweigh any savings from the bulk order. The following
points should be addressed to determine the proper volume of any chemical to
order.

Consider the following when placing an order:
\begin{itemize}
\item  
Investigate if there is a less hazardous substitute that can be used to
achieve the same results. This could reduce the hazards involved in the
process as well as the waste disposal costs.

\item Order only the amount likely to be used for its intended purpose
within the specified shelf life of the material and within the planned
timeframe of the procedure. This can minimize chemical waste if
processes or research changes and previously purchased chemicals are
no longer needed. Although many chemicals can be safely stored over
long periods of time, decomposition can result in explosions, ruptured
containers and the formation of hazardous by-products.

\item Evaluate the chemical properties that may preclude long-term
storage before the chemical quantity to be ordered is decided.

\item Order only the quantity that will fit into the appropriate
storage area(s).  Storing excess chemicals in a fume hood or outside
adequate storage facilities will create other hazards.

\item Request that the chemical vendor package the material in smaller
containers on large orders and request that stock be delivered on an
as needed basis.  This is particularly useful when one lot or a
special blend is required.

\item Consult laboratory chemical inventory lists, if available,
before ordering additional stock.

\item Manage the stock so that the oldest materials are used first.

\item Obtain the adequate quantity and type of spill control material
available to contain the maximum possible spill.
\end{itemize}


If you need assistance in making a determination on the most appropriate
quantity of chemical to purchase, please contact the EHS Office at 2-3477.


\subsection{Purchase of Non-Returnable Gas Cylinders}

The purchase of non-returnable gas cylinders should be avoided. All
gas cylinders should be returned to the supplying vendor when their
use is completed. All non-returnable cylinders will have to be
disposed of as hazardous waste, and the cost of doing so will be
charged to the DLC.

``Lecture bottles'' are often considered non-returnable by the
vendor. However, MIT has an agreement with their preferred chemical
vendor, BOC Group, to take back non-returnable gas cylinders,
including lecture bottles that where purchased through them. Contact
BOC Group on-campus directly at 3-4761 for more information.


\section{Hazardous Chemicals}
\label{sec:hazardous}

\subsection{Classification of Hazardous Chemicals}

Many of the substances encountered in the laboratory are known to be
toxic or corrosive, or both. Compounds that are explosive and/or are
highly flammable pose another significant type of hazard. New and
untested substances that may be hazardous are also frequently
encountered. Thus, it is essential that all laboratory workers
understand the types of toxicity, recognize the routes of exposure,
and are familiar with the major hazard classes of chemicals. The most
important single generalization regarding toxicity in chemical
research is {\em treat all compounds as potentially harmful,
especially new and unfamiliar materials, and work with them under
conditions to minimize exposure by skin contact and inhalation}.

When considering possible toxicity hazards while planning an experiment, it
is important to recognize that the combination of the toxic effects of two
substances may be significantly greater than the toxic effect of either
substance alone. Because most chemical reactions are likely to contain
mixtures of substances whose combined toxicities have never been evaluated,
it is prudent to assume that mixtures of different substances (e.g.,
chemical reaction mixtures) will be more toxic than the most toxic
ingredient contained in the mixture. Furthermore, chemical reactions
involving two or more substances may form reaction products that are
significantly more toxic than the starting reactants.

The OSHA Laboratory Standard (29 CFR 1910.1450) defines a {\bf
hazardous chemical} as ``a chemical for which there is statistically
significant evidence based on at least one study conducted in
accordance with established scientific principles that acute or
chronic health effects may occur in exposed employees. The term
`health hazard' includes chemicals which are carcinogens, toxic or
highly toxic agents, reproductive toxins, irritants, corrosives,
sensitizers, hepatotoxins, nephrotoxins, neurotoxins, agents which act
on the hematopoietic systems, and agents which damage the lungs, skin,
eyes, or mucous membranes''. Highly flammable and explosive substances
comprise a category of hazardous chemicals.

The major classes of hazardous chemicals are discussed in further
detail below. {\bf Particularly hazardous substances} are addressed in
Section~\ref{sec:particularly_hazardous}.


\subsubsection{Possible Carcinogens}

Carcinogens are chemical or physical agents that cause cancer. Generally
they are chronically toxic substances; that is, they cause damage after
repeated or long-duration exposure, and their effects may only become
evident after a long latency period. Chronic toxins are particularly
insidious because they may have no immediate apparent harmful effects. For a
large number of compounds there is limited evidence of carcinogenicity from
studies involving experimental animals. These compounds should be handled
using the general procedures for work with hazardous substances
outlined in Section~\ref{sec:sop_hazardous}.

Certain {\bf select carcinogens} are classified as ``particularly
hazardous substances'' and must be handled using the special
precautions described in
Section~\ref{sec:particularly_hazardous}. Select carcinogens include
compounds for which there is evidence from human studies that exposure
can cause cancer.

It is important to recognize that some substances involved in research
laboratories are new compounds and have not been subjected to testing for
carcinogenicity. Always keep in mind that as a general rule, all new and
untested compounds should be regarded as being toxic substances.

\subsubsection{Corrosive Substances}

Corrosive substances cause visible destruction of, or visible alterations
in, living tissue by chemical action at the site of contact. Major classes
of corrosive substances include strong acids (e.g., sulfuric, nitric,
hydrochloric, and hydrofluoric acids), strong bases (sodium hydroxide,
potassium hydroxide, and ammonium hydroxide), dehydrating agents (sulfuric
acid, sodium hydroxide, phosphorus pentoxide, and calcium oxide), and
oxidizing agents (hydrogen peroxide, chlorine, and bromine).

\subsubsection{Irritants}

Irritants are defined as non-corrosive chemicals that cause reversible
inflammatory effects on living tissue by chemical action at the site of
contact. A wide variety of organic and inorganic compounds are irritants and
consequently skin contact with all laboratory chemicals should always be
avoided.


\subsubsection{Toxic and Highly Toxic Agents}

For many chemicals, the health effects in humans may not have been
tested. Frequently, only basic animal testing has been done, such as
the LD$_50$ or the LC$_50$.  The LD$_50$ is the Lethal Dose that kills
50 percent of the animals when the chemical is given orally or applied
to the skin.  The LC$_50$ is the Lethal Concentration in air that
kills 50 percent of the animals.

OSHA regulations (29 CFR 1910.1200) define toxic and highly toxic
agents as substances with median lethal dose (LD$_{50}$) values as
given in Figure~\ref{fig:toxic}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
&{\bf Toxic} & {\bf Highly Toxic}\\

Oral LD$_{50}$ (albino rats)
&50-500 mg/kg & $<$50 mg/kg\\

Skin Contact LD$_{50}$ (albino rabbits)
&200-1000 mg/kg&$<$200 mg/kg\\

Inhalation LC$_{50}$ (albino rats)
&200-2000 ppm/air&$<$200 ppm/air  
\end{tabular}
\caption{Definitions of ``Toxic'' and ``Highly Toxic'' agents.\label{fig:toxic}}
\end{figure}


It is important to note that the above classification does not take
into consideration chronic toxicity (i.e. carcinogenicity and
reproductive toxicity). Also, note that LD$_{50}$ values vary
significantly between different species, and the human toxicity for a
substance may be greater or less than that measured in test animals.


In evaluating the {\bf acute toxicity} of chemical substances, the
HMIS (Hazardous Materials Identification System) rating criteria
developed by the National Paint and Coatings Association may be
helpful. HMIS numbers can often be found in MSDS's. LD$_{50}$ values
can be found in MSDS's and in references such as the {\em
Sigma-Aldrich Library of Chemical Safety Data} and Patnaik's {\em A
Comprehensive Guide to the Hazardous Properties of Chemical
Substances}. (See Figure~\ref{fig:ratings}).


\begin{sidewaysfigure}
\begin{tabular}{ccccccc}

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Definitions of the toxicity ratings for hazardous chemicals. \label{fig:ratings}}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

\subsubsection{Hazardous Substances with Toxic Effects on Specific Organs}

Substances included in this category include (a) hepatotoxins
(substances that produce liver damage such as nitrosamines and carbon
tetrachloride); (b) nephrotoxins (agents causing damage to the kidneys
such as certain halogenated hydrocarbons), (c) neurotoxins (substances
which produce their primary toxic effects on the nervous system such
as mercury, acrylamide, and carbon disulfide), (d) agents which act on
the hematopoietic system (such as carbon monoxide and cyanides which
decrease hemoglobin function and deprive the body tissues of oxygen),
and (e) agents which damage lung tissue such as asbestos and silica.

\subsubsection{Sensitizers}
A sensitizer (allergen) is a substance that causes exposed people to
develop an allergic reaction in normal tissue after repeated exposure
to the substance. Examples of allergens include diazomethane,
chromium, nickel, formaldehyde, isocyanates, arylhydrazines, benzylic
and allylic halides, and many phenol derivatives.

\subsubsection{Flammable and Explosive Substances}

A number of highly flammable substances are in common use in campus
laboratories. Explosive substances are materials that decompose under
conditions of mechanical shock, elevated temperature, or chemical action,
with the release of large volumes of gases and heat.

\subsection{Risk Assessment for Hazardous Chemicals}
The following outline provides a summary of the steps that laboratory
workers should use to assess the risks of handling hazardous
chemicals.  Note that if a Laboratory Chemical Safety Summary is not
already available, then following the protocol outlined here should
enable a worker to prepare their own LCSS.  For a detailed discussion
of how to evaluate hazards and assess risks in the laboratory, see
Chapter~3 of {\em Prudent Practices in the Laboratory} (National
Academy Press, Washington D. C., 1995).

\subsubsection{Identify Chemicals to be Used}

Identify the chemicals involved in the proposed experiment and determine the
amounts that will be used. Is the experiment to be done once, or will the
chemicals be handled repeatedly? Will the experiment be conducted in an open
laboratory, in an enclosed apparatus, or in a fume hood? Is it possible that
new or unknown substances will be generated in the experiment? Are any of
the workers involved in the experiment pregnant or likely to become
pregnant? Do they have any known sensitivities to specific chemicals?

\subsubsection{Consult Sources of Information}

Consult an up-to-date LCSS for each chemical involved in the planned
experiment (examine an up-to-date MSDS if an LCSS is not available). In
cases where substances with significant or unusual potential hazards are
involved, it may also be advisable to consult additional more detailed
references such as NIOSH/OSHA Guidelines, Patnaik, Patty's, and other
sources discussed above. Depending on the researcher's level of experience
and the degree of potential hazard associated with the proposed experiment,
it may also be necessary to obtain the assistance of supervisors and safety
professionals before proceeding with risk assessment.


\subsubsection{Evaluate Type of Toxicity}

Use the above sources of information to determine the type of toxicity
associated with each chemical involved in the proposed experiment. Are
any of the chemicals to be used acutely toxic or corrosive? Are any of
the chemicals to be used irritants or sensitizers? Will any select
carcinogens or possibly carcinogenic substances be encountered? For
many substances, it will be necessary to consult a listings of
carcinogens to identify chemical similarities to known
carcinogens. Are any chemicals involved in the proposed experiment
suspected to be reproductive or developmental toxins, or neurotoxins?


\subsubsection{Consider Possible Routes of Exposure}

Determine the potential routes of exposure for each chemical. Are the
chemicals gases, or are they volatile enough to present a significant risk
of exposure through inhalation? If liquid, can the substances be absorbed
through the skin? Is it possible that dusts or aerosols will be formed in
the experiment? Does the experiment involve a significant risk of
inadvertent ingestion or injection of chemicals?


\subsubsection{Evaluate Quantitative Information on Toxicity}

Consult the information sources to determine the LD$_{50}$ for each
chemical via the relevant routes of exposure. Determine the acute
toxicity hazard level for each substance, classifying each chemical as
highly toxic, moderately toxic, slightly toxic, etc. For substances
which pose inhalation hazards, take note of the TLV-TWA, STEL, and PEL
values.


\subsubsection{Select Appropriate Procedures to Minimize Exposure}

All work involving chemicals in MIT laboratories should be conducted
using the Standard Operating Procedures for Work with Hazardous
Chemicals outlined in Section~\ref{sec:sop_hazardous}. In addition,
laboratory workers must determine whether any of the chemicals to be
handled in the planned experiment meet the definition of a
particularly hazardous substance due to high acute toxicity,
carcinogenicity, and/or reproductive toxicity. If so, consider the
total amount of the substance that will be used, the expected
frequency of use, the chemical's routes of exposure, and the
circumstances of its use in the proposed experiment. Use this
information to determine whether it is appropriate to apply the
additional procedures for working with particularly hazardous
substances outlined in Section~\ref{sec:particularly_hazardous}. For
very toxic or hazardous substances, or specialized practices,
consideration must be given to whether additional consultation with
safety professionals and development of specialized SOPs is warranted.

\subsubsection{Evaluate Hazards of Flammable and Explosive Substances}

It should be noted that the risk assessment procedures described so
far in this section address only the hazards due to the toxic effects
of chemicals.  Hazards due to flammability, explosion, and reactivity
are equally important in risk assessment, and are discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:flammable}. Sources of information should be
consulted to evaluate the flammability, reactivity, and explosability
of each chemical involved in the proposed experiment, and appropriate
steps to minimize risks should then be taken.


\subsubsection{Prepare for Contingencies}

Note the signs and symptoms of exposure to the chemicals to be used in the
proposed experiment. Note appropriate measures to be taken in the event of
exposure or accidental release of any of the chemicals, and in the event of
a fire.


\subsection{SOP for Hazardous Chemicals}
\label{sec:sop_hazardous}

Literally thousands of different compounds are involved in the
research being conducted in campus laboratories. The specific health
hazards associated with many of these compounds are unknown, and many
substances are new compounds which have not been reported previously
in the chemical literature. Consequently it is impossible in this
Chemical Hygiene Plan to provide standard operating procedures for
specific hazardous substances. Instead, this section outlines general
procedures which should be employed in the use of all hazardous
substances.  Individual research groups may wish to supplement these
general procedures with standard operating procedures for handling
specific hazardous substances that are in frequent use in their
laboratories.

Several general principles apply to all work conducted in the laboratories
involving hazardous substances.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Preparation.} A cardinal rule of laboratory research is
that workers must determine the potential hazards associated with an
experiment before beginning it. Before working with any chemical, it
is the responsibility of the researcher to determine what physical and
health hazards are associated with the substance. This determination
may require consulting library references and material safety data
sheets, and may involve discussions with the laboratory supervisor and
Industrial Hygiene Program.

\item
{\bf Minimize exposure to chemicals.} All skin contact with chemicals
in the laboratory should be avoided. Use laboratory hoods and other
ventilation devices to prevent exposure to airborne substances
whenever possible (note that the use of hoods is {\em required} for work
with many hazardous substances).

\item
{\bf Do not underestimate risks.} Assume that any mixture of chemicals
will be more toxic than its most toxic component. All new compounds
and substances of unknown toxicity should be treated as toxic
substances.

\item
{\bf Be prepared for accidents.} Before beginning an experiment, know
what specific action you will take in the event of the accidental
release of any hazardous substances involved. Know the location of
all safety equipment including fire extinguishers, fire blankets, eye
washes, safety showers, spill carts and spill control materials, be
familiar with the location of the nearest fire alarm and telephone,
and know what telephone numbers to call in the event of an
emergency. Know the location of the circuit breakers for your
laboratory.
\end{itemize}

As indicated above, the majority of chemicals involved in research in
laboratories must be considered to be ``hazardous substances''. In
addition to the four general principles outlined above, the following
procedures should be standard practice for all work involving the use
of hazardous substances.

\subsubsection{Eye Protection}

MIT policy requires that all personnel, including visitors, wear eye
protection at all times while in Institute laboratories. Eye
protection is discussed in detail in Section~\ref{sec:eye_protection}.


\subsubsection{Personal Apparel}

Do not wear sandals or open-toed shoes or shoes made of woven material
when working with hazardous substances. Confine long hair and loose
clothing. Use suitable protective apparel including gloves as
discussed in detail in Section~\ref{sec:ppe}. It is advisable to wear
a laboratory coat when working with hazardous substances. This is
particularly important when wearing clothing such as shorts,
miniskirts, and T-shirts that leave a significant area of skin
exposed. In some cases laboratory supervisors may identify situations
where the use of lab coats or more protective apparel is mandatory.

\subsubsection{Avoid Skin Contact and Ingestion of Hazardous Substances}

Contact with the skin is a frequent mode of chemical injury. A common
result of skin contact is localized irritation, but an appreciable
number of hazardous substances are absorbed through the skin with
sufficient rapidity to produce systemic poisoning. Avoid contact with
hazardous substances by taking the following precautions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Wear gloves that are not permeable to the hazardous substances
being used.

\item Never use mouth suction to pipet chemicals or to start a siphon;
a pipet bulb or aspirator should instead be used to provide vacuum.

\item Never taste laboratory chemicals.

\item Wash your hands with soap and water immediately after working
with hazardous chemicals.

\item Eating, drinking, smoking, gum-chewing, and applying cosmetics
in laboratories where hazardous substances are in use is
prohibited. Do not store food, beverages, cups, or other drinking and
eating utensils in areas where hazardous chemicals are used or
stored.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Avoid Inhalation of Toxic Substances}

Inhalation of toxic vapors, mists, gases, or dusts can produce
poisoning by absorption through the mucous membranes of the mouth,
throat, and lungs, and can seriously damage these tissues by local
action. Inhaled gases or vapors may pass rapidly into the capillaries
of the lungs and be carried into the circulatory system. This
absorption can be extremely rapid. Procedures involving volatile toxic
substances and those operations involving solid or liquid toxic
substances that may result in the generation of aerosols should be
conducted in a laboratory hood or other containment device. See
Section~\ref{sec:hoods} for a detailed discussion of laboratory
hoods. OSHA Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) and American Conference
of Governmental Industrial Hygienists Threshold Limit Values (TLVs)
should be observed when working with hazardous substances for which
PELs and TLVs have been established (see the ACGIH booklet in the
Library of Lab Safety for tables of TLV values of laboratory
chemicals). Never smell compounds of unknown toxicity.


\subsubsection{Use and Maintenance of Equipment and Glassware}

Good equipment maintenance is important for safe, efficient
operations.  Equipment should be inspected and maintained
regularly. Servicing schedules will depend on both the possibilities
and the consequences of failure.  Maintenance plans should include a
procedure to ensure that a device that is out of service cannot be
restarted.

Improper use of glassware is a frequent cause of injuries and accidents in
the laboratory.

\begin{itemize}
\item Careful handling and storage procedures should be used to avoid
damaging glassware. Always carefully inspect glassware for flaws and
cracks before use. Damaged items should be discarded or repaired.

\item
Adequate hand protection should be used when inserting glass tubing
into rubber stoppers or corks or when placing rubber tubing on
glasshose connections. Tubing should be fire polished or rounded and
lubricated, and hands should be held close together to limit movement
of glass should fracture occur. The use of plastic or metal connectors
should be considered.

\item 
Glass-blowing operations should not be attempted unless proper
annealing facilities are available.

\item 
Vacuum-jacketed glass apparatus should be handled with extreme care to
prevent implosions. Equipment such as Dewar flasks should be taped or
shielded. Only glassware designed for vacuum work should be used for
that purpose.

\item
Hand protection should be used when picking up broken glass. (Small pieces
should be swept up with a brush into a dustpan).

\item
Broken glassware syringes, and other ``sharp objects'' must be
disposed of properly. Such waste should be separated from other trash
and stored for pickup in clearly marked containers labeled
``sharps''.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Housekeeping}

There is a definite relationship between safety and orderliness in the
laboratory. The following housekeeping rules should be adhered to in
all laboratories:

\begin{itemize}
\item Work areas (including floors) should be cleaned regularly. Do
not allow trash to accumulate.

\item
Access to exits and safety equipment must not be obstructed.

\item
All gas tanks should be secured to walls or benches.

\item
Solvents should not be stored on the floor and large containers (more
than 1 liter) must be stored below eye level (e.g. in cabinets).

\item
Chemical storage refrigerators should be defrosted periodically and
should not be overcrowded.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Work Conducted Outside Normal Hours}

Researchers should avoid conducting work with hazardous substances
when they are alone in the laboratory. When working alone, arrange
with Campus Police or workers in other laboratories to check on you
periodically. Some experiments are too hazardous to be conducted alone
under any circumstances; it is the responsibility of researchers to
consult with their supervisor to identify such particularly hazardous
operations.

Laboratory operations involving hazardous substances are sometimes carried
out continuously or overnight. It is the responsibility of the researcher to
design these experiments with provisions to prevent the release of hazardous
substances in the event of interruptions in utility services such as
electricity, cooling water, and inert gas. Laboratory lights should be left
on and appropriate signs should be posted identifying the nature of the
experiment and the hazardous substances in use. In some cases arrangements
should be made for periodic inspection of the operation by other workers.
Information should be left indicating how to contact you in the event of an
emergency.

\subsubsection{Children and Pets in Laboratories}

Pet animals are not permitted in laboratories where hazardous substances are
stored or are in use. It is urged that children not be permitted in
laboratories. However, if they are allowed, they must be under the direct
supervision of their parent or other qualified adult, and should only
allowed to visit only for a brief period of time.

\subsubsection{Storage of Hazardous Substances}

Researchers should consult the EHS Office SOP on Chemical Storage and
{\em Prudent Practices in the Laboratory} pp. 72--76 for a discussion
of procedures for storing chemicals in laboratories. All procedures
employed must comply with OSHA regulations. The following minimum
guidelines must be adhered to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Access to all hazardous chemicals, including toxic and corrosive
substances, should be restricted at all times. Specifically, these
materials should be stored in laboratories or storerooms that are kept
locked at all times that laboratory personnel are not present. In the
case of unusually toxic or hazardous materials, additional precautions
are advisable, such as keeping the materials in locked storage
cabinets.

Due to the unique design of the Stata Center, the locations of the
laboratories, and the fact that most visitors would not be expecting
the presence of hazardous chemicals in the building, additional access
control is necessary. In particular, not only should the doors to the
laboratory rooms 32-306, 32-308, and 32-322 be locked whenever
possible, all doors to the ``neighborhood'' that includes these rooms
should be locked and only accessible to those who have a need to enter
the area. Reducing incidental and unnecessary foot traffic through the
lab neighborhood area creates a safer environment for both researchers
and visitors. In case of a building fire emergency, all doors should
unlock, so that people can reach the fire stairs located within the
lab neighborhood.

\item
To avoid the accumulation of excess chemicals, always purchase the
minimum quantities of commercial chemicals necessary for your
research.

\item
All containers of chemicals (including research samples) should be
properly labeled. When appropriate, special hazards should be
indicated on the label. For certain classes of compounds
(e.g. ethers), the date the container was opened should be written on
the label.

\item Only small quantities (less than 1 liter) of flammable liquids
should be kept at work benches. Larger quantities should be stored
away from ignition sources in flammable storage cabinets. It is
advisable to purchase highly flammable solvents (e.g., acetone,
hexane, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, THF) only in metal or
break-resistant (i.e., plastic or plastic-coated) containers.

\item
Refrigerators used for storage of chemicals must be explosion-proof or
laboratory-safe type units. Storage trays or secondary containers should be
used to minimize the distribution of material in the event a container
should leak or break.

\item Large containers (more than 1 liter) should be stored below
eye-level on low shelves. Never store hazardous chemicals on the
floor.

\item 
Research groups must maintain an inventory list or card file of
hazardous substances present in their laboratories.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Transporting Hazardous Substances}

MIT policy requires that chemicals be transported between stockrooms
and laboratories in break-resistant or approved secondary containers.
Approved secondary containers are defined as commercially available
bottle carriers made of rubber, metal, or plastic, with carrying
handle(s), and which are large enough to hold the contents of the
chemical container in the event of breakage. When transporting
cylinders of compressed gases, always strap the cylinder in a suitable
hand truck and protect the valve with a cover cap. For shipping
hazardous materials off-site, please refer to Section~\ref{sec:shipping}.


\subsubsection{Handling of Excess and Waste Chemicals}

Consideration of the means of disposal of chemical wastes should be
part of the planning of all experiments before they are carried
out. The cost of disposing of excess and waste chemicals has become
extremely expensive, and frequently exceeds the original cost of
purchasing the chemical. Whenever practical, order the minimum amount
of material possible in order to avoid the accumulation of large
stocks of ``excess chemicals'' which will not be needed in future
research. Such collections of ``excess chemicals'' frequently
constitute safety hazards, since many substances decompose upon long
storage and occasionally their containers become damaged or
degrade. In addition, the disposal of significant quantities of excess
chemicals ultimately presents a very significant financial burden to
faculty research accounts.

The procedures for handling excess and waste chemicals are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:waste}.

\subsubsection{Flammable and Explosive Substances}
\label{sec:flammable}

Flammable substances are among the most common of the hazardous
materials found in campus laboratories. Flammable substances are
materials that readily catch fire and burn in air. A flammable liquid
does not itself burn; it is the vapors from the liquid that burn. The
rate at which different liquids produce flammable vapors depends on
their vapor pressure, which increases with temperature. The degree of
fire hazard depends also on the ability to form combustible or
explosive mixtures with air, the ease of ignition of these mixtures,
and the relative densities of the liquid with respect to water and of
the gas with respect to air.

An open beaker of diethyl ether set on the laboratory bench next to a
Bunsen burner will ignite, whereas a similar beaker of diethyl
phthalate will not.  The difference in behavior is due to the fact
that the ether has a much lower flash point. The {\bf flash point} is
the lowest temperature, as determined by standard tests, at which a
liquid gives off vapor in sufficient concentration to form an
ignitable mixture with air near the surface of the liquid within the
test vessel. As indicated in the following table, many common
laboratory solvents and chemicals have flash points that are lower
than room temperature and are potentially very dangerous.


\begin{tabular}{|ll|ll|}
\hline
&Flash Point (\degreeC) & & Flash Point (\degreeC)\\
\hline
Acetone & -17.8 & Ethanol & 12.8\\
Benzene& -11.1 & Hexane & -21.7\\
Carbon disulfide & -30.0 & Methanol &11.1\\
Cyclohexane& -20.0&Pentane&-40.0\\
Diethyl ether&-45.0&Toluene &4.4\\
\hline
\end{tabular}


\paragraph{Handling Flammable Substances}

The following basic precautions should be followed in handling flammable
substances.

\begin{itemize}
\item Flammable substances should be handled only in areas free of
ignition sources. Besides open flames, ignition sources include
electrical equipment (especially motors), static electricity, and for
some materials (e.g. carbon disulfide), even hot surfaces.

\item Never heat a flammable substance with an open flame.

\item
When transferring flammable liquids in metal equipment, static-generated
sparks should be avoided by bonding and the use of ground straps.

\item
Ventilation is one of the most effective ways to prevent the formation
of flammable mixtures. A laboratory hood should be used whenever
appreciable quantities of flammable substances are transferred from
one container to another, allowed to stand or heated in open
containers, or handled in any other way. Be sure that the hood is free
of all ignition sources including, in particular, variacs.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Handling Explosive Substances}

Explosive substances are materials that decompose under conditions of
mechanical shock, elevated temperature, or chemical action, with the
release of large volumes of gases and heat. Special precautions are
required for the safe use of explosive materials. It is the
responsibility of the researcher to evaluate the explosive hazards
involved in their work and to consult with their supervisor to develop
detailed standard operating procedures for any work involving
explosive substances. Work with explosive materials will generally
require the use of special protective apparel (face shields, gloves,
lab coats) and protective devices such as explosion shields and
barriers.

Organic peroxides are among the most hazardous substances handled in
campus laboratories. As a class, they are low-power explosives,
hazardous because of their sensitivity to shock, sparks, and even
friction (as in a cap being twisted open). Many peroxides that are
routinely handled in laboratories are far more sensitive to shock than
most primary explosives such as TNT. All organic peroxides are highly
flammable, and most are sensitive to heat, friction, impact, light, as
well as strong oxidizing and reducing agents.

Some peroxides in use at MIT are commercial compounds such as benzoyl
peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, and t-butyl hydroperoxide. However, many
common solvents and reagents are known to form peroxides on exposure
to air, and these chemicals often become contaminated with sufficient
peroxides to pose a serious hazard. Classes of compounds that form
peroxides by auto-oxidation include:

\begin{itemize}
  
\item Aldehydes including acetaldehyde and benzaldehyde,

\item
Ethers with primary and/or secondary alkyl groups, including acyclic
and cyclic ethers, acetals, and ketals. Examples include diethyl
ether, diisopropyl ether (especially dangerous!), dioxane, DME, THF,
ethyl vinyl ether and alcohols protected as THP ethers. Isopropyl
alcohol also frequently forms peroxides upon storage.

\item
Hydrocarbons with allylic, benzylic, or propargylic hydrogens. Examples of
this class of peroxide-formers include cyclohexene, cyclooctene, methyl
acetylene, isopropylbenzene (cumene), and tetralin (tetrahydronaphthalene).

\item
Conjugated dienes, enynes, and diynes, among which divinylacetylene is
particularly hazardous.

\item
Saturated hydrocarbons with exposed tertiary hydrogens, such as
decalin (decahydronaphthalene) and 2,5-dimethylhexane.
\end{itemize}

Compounds belonging to the classes listed above cannot form peroxides
without exposure to oxygen (or other oxidizers). Consequently, when storing
these materials always flush the container with an inert gas such as
nitrogen or argon before sealing. If the compound is not volatile, it may be
advisable to degas the sample by vacuum or bubbling techniques. In some
cases it may be appropriate to add an oxidation inhibitor such as
hydroquinone or BHT (2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol) to the sample.
Containers should be tightly sealed and dated upon receipt and when first
opened. Recommended safe storage limits vary depending on the identity of
the material and exposure to light and air, but can be as low as 3 months.
Do not attempt to open bottles of liquid ethers (e.g. diisopropyl ether)
containing crystallized material; contact the EHS Office (452-3477) for
assistance in disposal.


Before distilling any known or suspected peroxide-former, check it carefully
for the presence of peroxides. Containers should also be checked
periodically after extended storage. Either of the following tests will
detect most (but not all) peroxy compounds including all hydroperoxides:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Add 1-3 mL of the liquid to be tested to an equal volume of acetic
acid, add a few drops of 5\% aqueous KI solution, and shake. The
appearance of a yellow to brown color indicates the presence of
peroxides.
\item
Add 0.5 mL of the liquid to be tested to a mixture of 1 mL of 10\%
aqueous KI solution and 0.5 mL of dilute HCl to which has been added a
few drops of starch solution just prior to the test. The appearance of
a blue or blue-black color within a minute indicates the presence of
peroxides.
\end{enumerate}

Low concentrations of peroxides can generally be removed by filtering
the contaminated material through a column of chromatography-grade
basic alumina. Several methods are available for the
``deperoxidation'' of ether solvents; for a discussion, see Burfield,
D. R. J. Org. Chem. 1982, 47, 3821. To destroy small quantities (25 g
or less) of peroxides, dilute with water (to a concentration of 2\%
or less) and then transfer to an aqueous solution of an appropriate
reducing agent (such as ferrous sulfate or sodium bisulfite) in a
polyethylene container.


For assistance in disposing of larger quantities of peroxides or other
explosive materials, contact the EHS Office.


\paragraph{Control and Reporting of Fires}
In the event of a fire, activate the nearest fire alarm to order
evacuation of the building and summon assistance from the Fire
Department. When the fire alarm sounds, all personnel are required to
leave the building. MIT Policy states that personnel are not required
to fight fires. Only properly trained personnel should attempt to put
out a fire.


\section{Particularly Hazardous Substances}
\label{sec:particularly_hazardous}

Because of the significant risk to environment, health, and safety, the use
of select carcinogens, reproductive toxins (mutagens and teratogens),
biotoxins and substances with a high degree of acute toxicity, known
collectively as particularly hazardous substances, are more stringently
regulated and require additional precautions.

\subsection{Classification of Particularly Hazardous Substances}

As discussed in the previous section of this Chemical Hygiene Plan,
hazardous chemicals are chemicals for which there is scientific
evidence that adverse acute or chronic health effects may occur in
exposed workers.  An agent is an acute toxin if its toxic effects are
manifested after a single or short-duration exposure. Chronically
toxic agents show their effects after repeated or long-duration
exposure and the effects usually become evident only after a long
latency period. Many of the substances in frequent use in laboratories
are classified as hazardous substances. There are some substances,
however, that pose such significant threats to human health that they
are classified as ``particularly hazardous substances'' (PHS's). The
OSHA Laboratory Standard requires that special provisions be
established to prevent the harmful exposure of researchers to
PHS's. General procedures for working with such materials are
presented in detail in this section.

Chemicals are classified as particularly hazardous substances if they
belong to one or more of the following three categories. Compounds
classified as particularly hazardous substances generally must then be
handled using the procedures outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:sop_particularly_hazardous}.

\subsubsection{Select Carcinogens}

Certain potent carcinogens are classified as ``select carcinogens''
and treated as PHS's. A select carcinogen is defined in the OSHA Lab
Standard as a substance that meets one of the following criteria:

\begin{enumerate}
\item It is regulated by OSHA as a carcinogen. Detailed information
about and a complete listing of these regulated carcinogens can be
found at \url{http://www.osha-slc.gov/SLTC/carcinogens/index.html}

\item It is listed as ``known to be a carcinogen'' in the latest
Annual Report on Carcinogens published by the National Toxicology
Program (NTP).  The latest edition of the NTP Annual Report on
Carcinogens (known human carcinogens listing) can be found at:
\url{http://ntp-server.niehs.nih.gov/htdocs/8\_RoC/Known\_list.html}

\item It is listed under Group 1 (``carcinogenic to humans'') by the
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The latest edition
of the IARC Monographs (Group 1 carcinogen listing) can be found at:
\url{http://193.51.164.11/monoeval/crthgr01.html}

\item It is listed under IARC Group 2A or 2B, (``probably carcinogenic
to humans'') or under the category ``reasonably anticipated to be a
carcinogen'' by the NTP, and causes statistically significant tumor
incidence in experimental animals in accordance with any of the
following criteria: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item after inhalation exposure of 6-7 hours per day, 5 days per week,
for a significant portion of a lifetime to dosages of less than 10
mg/m3;
\item after repeated skin application of less than 300 mg/kg of
body weight per week; or 
\item after oral dosages of less than 50 mg/kg of body weight per day.
\end{enumerate}

The latest edition of IARC Monographs (Group 2A and Group 2B
carcinogen listings) can be found at: 

\paragraph{Group 2A}

\end{enumerate}

The following is a partial list of substances that may be used in \DLC.

\begin{tabular}{ll}
{\bf Some Select Carcinogens}\\
acrylamide & certain chromium compounds\\
certain arsenic compounds&formaldehyde\\
asbestos
\end{tabular}

Note: the above list is not intended to be complete, and it is the
responsibility of the researcher (in consultation with their laboratory
supervisor) to evaluate each compound involved in their work and to
determine whether it should be handled as a select carcinogen.

\subsubsection{Reproductive and Developmental Toxins}

Reproductive toxins are chemicals that adversely affect the
reproductive process. These toxins include mutagens that can cause
chromosomal damage and teratogens, the effects of which include
retarded fetal growth, birth defects, fetal malformations, and fetal
death.

Knowledge of how chemicals affect reproductive health is in its
preliminary stage. It has been only since 1973 that manufacturers were
required by the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to test chemicals
other than drugs for their effects on reproductive health.

Although a few well-controlled studies have been conducted, the
evidence for most chemicals is limited to case reports or to studies
done on a small group of exposed people after a problem emerged. Of
approximately 55,000 chemical substances and mixtures in commercial
production (not including drugs, pesticides, and food additives), only
a limited number have been tested thoroughly on animals for
reproductive effects.

Reproductive toxins can affect both men and women. For women, exposure
to reproductive toxins during pregnancy can cause adverse effects on
the fetus. These effects include embryolethality (death of the
fertilized egg, embryo or fetus), malformations (teratogenic effects),
and postnatal functional defects.  Examples of embryotoxins include
thalidomide and certain antibiotics such as tetracycline. Women of
childbearing potential should note that embryotoxins have the greatest
impact during the first trimester of pregnancy. Because a woman often
does not know that she is pregnant during this period of high
susceptibility, special caution is advised when working with all
chemicals, especially those rapidly absorbed through the skin (e.g.,
formamide).  Pregnant women and women intending to become pregnant
should consult with their laboratory supervisor and the EHS Office
before working with substances that are suspected to be reproductive
toxins. As minimal precautions, the general procedures outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:sop_particularly_hazardous} should then be followed for
work with such compounds.

Sources of information about chemicals that pose a risk to human
reproduction include:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The chemical list generated pursuant to the State of California's Safe
Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (Proposition
65). This list includes chemicals known to the State of California to
cause reproductive toxicity.
\item
Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) for those chemicals.
\item
The EHS Office
\item Catalog of Teratogenic Agents, Sixth Edition;
Shepard, T. H.; Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1989. 
\item Beyler, R. E. and Meyers, V. K. J. Chem. Ed. 1982, 59, 759-763 for
a discussion of ``What Every Chemist Should Know About Teratogens''.
\end{itemize}

The following lists some materials that can be found in \DLC that are
suspected to be reproductive toxins; in most laboratories it will be
appropriate to handle these compounds as particularly hazardous
substances.

\begin{tabular}{ll}
{\bf Some Reproductive Toxins}\\
ethers & toluene\\
lead compounds &xylene\\
mercury compounds
\end{tabular}

Note: The above list is not intended to be complete, and it is the
responsibility of the researcher (in consultation with their
laboratory supervisor) to evaluate each compound involved in their
work and to determine whether it should be handled as a reproductive
toxin.

\subsubsection{Compounds with a High Degree of Acute Toxicity}

Compounds that have a high degree of acute toxicity comprise a third
category of particularly hazardous substances as defined by the OSHA
Lab Standard. Substances that have a high degree of acute toxicity are
interpreted by OSHA as being substances which ``may be fatal or cause
damage to target organs as the result of a single exposure or
exposures of short duration.''  ``Toxic'' and ``highly toxic'' agents
are defined by OSHA regulations (29 CFR 1910.1200) (see
Figure~\ref{fig:toxic}).

Substances with a high degree of acute toxicity include, but are not
limited to: certain corrosive compounds, irritants, sensitizers
(allergens), hepatotoxins, nephrotoxins, neurotoxins, agents that act
on the hematopoietic systems, and agents which damage the lungs,
skins, eyes, or mucous membranes.

The following lists some compounds used in \DLC that have a high
degree of acute toxicity:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\bf Some Compounds with a High Degree of
Acute Toxicity}\\ hydrogen fluoride&sodium cyanide (and other cyanide
salts)\\ sodium azide
\end{tabular}

Note: the above list is not intended to be complete, and it is the
responsibility of the researcher (in consultation with their laboratory
supervisor) to evaluate each compound involved in their work and to
determine whether it is a substance with a high degree of acute toxicity.

Compounds classified as having a high degree of acute toxicity must
generally be handled using the procedures outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:sop_particularly_hazardous}. Finally, several of the
compounds listed may require prior approval from the DLC EHS Committee
before work with them can be carried out. See
Section~\ref{sec:dlc_approval} for a discussion of prior approval
requirements.

In evaluating the hazards associated with work with toxic substances, it is
important to note that a number of factors influence the response of
individuals to exposure to toxic compound. For example, people are rarely
exposed to a single biologically active substance. With this point in mind,
it is noteworthy that one toxin can influence the effect of a second. This
underscores the importance of maintaining good laboratory practices at all
times, and with all chemicals.

\subsection{Designated Areas}

A key requirement of the OSHA Laboratory Standard is that all work
with particularly hazardous substances be confined to designated
areas. A designated area is defined as a laboratory, an area of a
laboratory, or a device such as a glove box, fume hood bench that is
posted with warning signs that ensure that all employees working in
the area are informed of the hazardous substances in use there.

Reducing the potential for exposure to particularly hazardous
chemicals is achieved by restricting the use of the material to a
designated area equipped with the proper control devices. Particularly
hazardous substances should be stored, used, and prepared for disposal
only in designated areas.  The boundaries of and procedures within a
designated area should be defined in any specialized standard
operating procedures developed for specific Particularly hazardous
substances. Operating procedures should address storage, use of
protective equipment, use of containment equipment disposal and
decontamination procedures.

It is the responsibility of laboratory supervisors to define the
designated areas in their laboratories and to post these areas with
conspicuous signs reading ``DESIGNATED AREA FOR USE OF PARTICULARLY
HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES--AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY''

Laboratory hoods can serve as designated areas for most
research. Laboratory supervisors are required to notify the Chemical
Hygiene Officer of the specific location of any designated areas
established in their research groups that are not laboratory hoods.

\subsection{SOP for Particularly Hazardous Substances}
\label{sec:sop_particularly_hazardous}

MIT policy requires that laboratories develop additional written
standard operating procedures if the general SOPs provided in this
Plan for work with generally and particularly hazardous chemicals DO
NOT adequately ensure the protection of personal health and safety,
and the environment. If a particular chemical, activity, or usage
falls outside of the general guidelines provided here, the laboratory
must prepare written procedures that mitigate environment, health and
safety risks. This is particularly applicable if a procedure requires
detailed and specific guidance to avoid dangerous exposure or
consequences. SOPs must be developed prior to initiating any of the
particularly hazardous procedures.

The following general procedures should be followed in work with
substances with {\bf high acute toxicity}, i.e. substances that can be
fatal or cause serious damage to target organs as the result of a
single exposure of short duration. These procedures should also be
employed in laboratory operations using those carcinogens and
reproductive toxins for which infrequent, small quantities do not
constitute a significant hazard, but which can be dangerous to workers
exposed to high concentrations or repeated small doses. A substance
that is not known to cause cancer in humans, but which has shown
statistically significant, but low, carcinogenic potency in animals,
generally should also be handled according to the procedures outlined
in this section. Keep in mind that all of the general rules for work
with toxic substances discussed in Section~\ref{sec:hazardous}. of
this Chemical Hygiene Plan also apply to work with particularly
hazardous substances.

\subsubsection{Information}

Before beginning a laboratory operation, each researcher should
consult the appropriate literature for information about the toxic
properties of the substances that will be used. The precautions and
procedures described below should be followed if any of the substances
to be used in significant quantities is known to have high acute or
moderate chronic toxicity. If any of the substances being used is
known to be highly toxic, it is desirable that there be at least two
people present in the area at all times. These procedures should also
be followed if the toxicological properties of any of the substances
being used or prepared are unknown.

\subsubsection{Zero Skin Contact}

Contact with the skin is a frequent mode of chemical injury. Many
toxic substances are absorbed through the skin with sufficient
rapidity to produce systemic poisoning. {\em Avoid all skin contact
with particularly hazardous substances} by using suitable protective
apparel including the appropriate type of gloves or gauntlets (long
gloves) and a suitable laboratory coat or apron which covers all
exposed skin. See Section~\ref{sec:ppe} for a further discussion of
protective apparel. Always wash hands and arms with soap and water
immediately after working with these materials. In the event of
accidental skin contact, the affected areas should be flushed with
water and medical attention should be obtained as soon as possible.


\subsubsection{Laboratory Hoods}

Inhalation of toxic vapors, mists, gases, or dusts can produce
poisoning by absorption through the mucous membrane of the mouth,
throat, and lungs, and can seriously damage these tissues by local
action. Inhaled gases or vapors may pass rapidly into the capillaries
of the lungs and be carried into the circulatory system. This
absorption can be extremely rapid. {\em Procedures involving volatile
toxic substances and those operations involving solid or liquid toxic
substances that may result in the generation of aerosols must be
conducted in a hood or other suitable containment device}. The hood
should have been evaluated previously to establish that it is
providing adequate ventilation and has an average face velocity of not
less than 80 linear ft/min. See Section~\ref{sec:hoods} for further
discussion of the operation of laboratory hoods.

\subsubsection{Be Prepared for Accidents}

The laboratory worker should always be prepared for possible accidents or
spills involving toxic substances. To minimize hazards from accidental
breakage of apparatus or spills of toxic substances in the hood, containers
of such substances should generally be stored in pans or trays made of
polyethylene or other chemically resistant material and (particularly in
large scale work) apparatus should be mounted above trays of the same type
of material. Alternatively, the working surface of the hood can be fitted
with a removable liner of adsorbent plastic-backed paper. Such procedures
will contain spilled toxic substances in a pan, tray, or adsorbent liner and
greatly simplify subsequent cleanup and disposal.

If a major release of a particularly hazardous substance occurs outside the
hood, then the room or appropriate area should be evacuated and necessary
measures taken to prevent exposure of other workers. The EHS Office should
be contacted immediately (452-3477) for assistance and equipment for spill
clean-up. EHS Office personnel can be contacted for assistance after working
hours by calling Campus Police (ext. 100). Spills should only be cleaned up
by personnel wearing suitable personal protective apparel. Contaminated
clothing and shoes should be thoroughly decontaminated or incinerated. 

\subsubsection{Don't Contaminate the Environment}

Vapors that are discharged from experiments involving particularly
hazardous substances should be trapped or condensed to avoid adding
substantial quantities of toxic vapor to the hood exhaust air. The
general waste disposal procedures outlined in Section~\ref{sec:waste}
should be followed. However, certain additional precautions should be
observed when waste materials are known to contain substances of
moderate or high toxicity.  Volatile toxic substances should never be
disposed of by evaporation in the hood. Waste materials and solvents
containing toxic substances should be stored in closed, impervious
containers so that personnel handling the containers will not be
exposed to their contents. All containers of toxic wastes should be
suitably labeled to indicate the contents (chemicals and approximate
amounts) and the type of toxicity hazard that contact may pose.  All
chemical waste should be disposed of in a safe manner to ensure that
personnel are not exposed to the material.

\subsubsection{Recordkeeping}

It is recommended that every research group in the department maintain
a list of all particularly hazardous substances in use in their
laboratories, including an inventory of the maximum quantity present
at any given time. It is recommended that EHS Representatives be
assigned the responsibility for ensuring that this inventory list is
kept up to date. In addition, records that include amounts of material
used and names of workers involved should be kept as part of the
laboratory notebook record of all experiments involving particularly
hazardous substances.

\subsubsection{Restrict Access}

Those operations involving particularly hazardous substances where
there is the possibility of the accidental release of harmful
quantities of the toxic substance must be carried out in designated
areas. As discussed above, many laboratory hoods are designated areas
for work with particularly hazardous substances. Designated areas
should be posted with special warning signs indicating that
particularly toxic substances may be in use.

\subsection{Select Toxins}

{\bf Select Toxins} are biologically derived toxic chemicals that are
specifically regulated by the federal U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services under regulation 42 CFR Part 73 when handled at levels
above specified quantities.  

\begin{comment}
These materials are highly toxic and
special precautions need to be taken whenever handling concentrated
forms, even in small amounts. Stocks of these chemicals should be
stored under lock and key.
\end{comment}

{\em Select Toxins will not be used within \DLC}.


\section{Personal Protective Equipment}
\label{sec:ppe}

Personal protective equipment (PPE), to include eye and face
protection, gloves, protective clothing, head protection, hearing
protection, and protective footwear may be needed to assure an
employee is adequately protected from hazards associated with the work
they are doing.  When personal protective equipment is needed, it is
required by regulation that a hazard assessment be made to identify
the specific hazards of concern and the PPE required for protection
from those hazards. This hazard assessment may be done for a work
area, or for a specific experiment, job, or task. The protective
equipment is selected based on the hazard assessment. This assessment
needs to be documented in writing. For more information on PPE, visit
the EHS Office website.

\subsection{Respirators}

When chemical substitution and effective engineering controls are not
possible, respirators should be used. The Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA) General Industry Standard on Respiratory
Protection, 29 CFR 1910.134, requires that a Respiratory Protection
Program be established by the employer and that respirators be
provided and be effective when such equipment is necessary to protect
the health of the employee.

{\em Respirators should not be needed for any work done in \DLC.}

\subsection{Eye Protection}
\label{sec:eye_protection}
MIT policy requires that personnel use eye protection when directly
handling chemicals, when closely observing chemical processes, or when
visitng any space that is posted with ``Eye Protection Required,'' or
equivalent. Wear only eye protection, such as safety glasses,
goggles, or face shields that meet the ANSI Occupational and
Educational Eye and Face Protection Standard (Z87.1) standard for
impact resistance. Don't rely on ``visitor'' safety glasses or normal
prescription glasses because these do not have the same impact
resistance. For more information and guidance on obtaining eye
protection, visit the EHS Office website.

\paragraph{Safety glasses} should be used when working with solid
materials. Standard eyeglasses with side shields are generally not
sufficient. Safety glasses should not be used when a significant
splash potential exists.


\paragraph{Chemical Splash Goggles} should be used when a splash hazard
exists. These generally can be worn over regular eyeglasses. Goggles
equipped with vents should be used to prevent fogging.

\paragraph{Face shields} should be worn when maximum protection from flying
particles and harmful liquids is needed. These may be used in
conjunction with goggles for maximum protection from corrosives and
hot chemicals.

DLCs are responsible for providing eye protection to anyone who works,
studies or visits a lab, shop or other area where there are hazards to
the eyes. Supervisors are responsible for reminding people to wear eye
protection and for posting signs in these areas. All personnel are
responsible for wearing the appropriate eye protection when necessary.

\subsubsection{Contact Lenses}

Contact lenses pose special problems in the work environment:
\begin{itemize}
\item They can absorb chemical fumes.

\item They can allow long and intimate contact of toxic chemicals with
the eye.

\item They can trap chemicals and particles in the space between the
contact lens and the eye. Lenses can be difficult to remove in an
emergency due to muscle spasms of the eye.

\item Flushing with large amounts of water may not remove eye
contaminants if contact lenses remain in place.
\end{itemize}

Employees who work in locations where there is a risk of eye injury,
including punctures, abrasions, contusions, or burns as a result of
contact with flying particles, hazardous substances, or projection of
injurious light rays must wear adequate face or eye protection.
Employees who work in these environments and who wear contact lenses
must wear medically approved eye protection.

If you are uncertain of the effect of your work environment on your
contact lenses, you are advised to exercise prudent measures by always
wearing goggles, safety glasses, or face shields when in doubt.  If it
is determined that protective equipment is needed, its use must be
reviewed first by EHS.

If you wear contact lenses at work, inform your supervisor and
co-workers of this fact so that proper emergency measures can be taken
if necessary.

When working in an area where chemicals or other harmful materials are
used, wash and rinse your hands thoroughly with soap and water before
handling contact lenses.  This procedure applies even if gloves are
worn.

Never leave or store contact lenses in any room where volatile
chemicals are present.

\subsection{Hand Protection}

In the performance of works, there is a high potential for the hands
to be injured or contaminated. Hand injuries are common in the
workplace and many of these injuries could be prevented by the use of
proper personal protective equipment, usually gloves. In addition, for
some jobs, the hands could become contaminated with work materials
such as radioisotopes, biological agents, or chemicals. Once
contaminated, they become a source for spreading contamination to
other areas, to food, or other objects that are put in the
mouth. Gloves are often used to prevent hand contamination and to
raise awareness regarding the potential for contamination of other
surfaces touched by those gloves.

It should be understood that each glove type has limitations, and a
glove selected for protection against one type of hazard will not
necessarily be effective against another type of hazard. If the work
or task involves more than one type of hazard, this must be taken into
consideration in selecting the best type of glove for the
circumstances.

Note: latex gloves provide no protection to exposure from most organic
compounds. The 4H line brand of gloves, although expensive, offer the
most protection from among the various gloves available in lab
supplies. In some cases, two gloves should be worn on each hand to
ensure that no exposure will occur in the event of damage to the outer

Consult a chemicals Material Data Safety Sheet (MSDS), the glove
manufacturers literature, or the EHS Office for chemical protective
clothing references when choosing gloves for a specific application.

In order to prevent the unintentional spread of hazardous substances,
always remove gloves before leaving your laboratory and handling
objects such as doorknobs, telephones, pens, etc.

\subsection{Body and Foot Protection}

Clothing may be used to provide protection from chemical hazards that
may damage the skin or personal clothing. In addition, it can be used
to protect an employees personal clothing from contamination or dirt
that can be carried home or to other areas. For example, a lab coat
can be used to protect an employees personal clothing from incidental
chemical contact or contamination from radioactive or biological
agents. The lab coat is to be worn in the lab and removed when the
employee leaves the laboratory space.  Coveralls can be used to
protect a maintenance employees skin and clothing from contamination
in dirty areas or from high levels of dust generated during some
jobs. When working with corrosive chemicals, an employee may need a
rubber apron or chemical resistant suit, depending on the specific
task to be done. For assistance with selection of personal protective
clothing, contact the EHS Office. Contaminated protective clothing
must be disposed of properly and not reused unless properly cleaned.

Open-toed shoes, sandals, or open-toed sneakers shall not be worn in
laboratories.

\section{Other Safety Equipment}

\subsection{Laboratory Fume Hoods/Ventilation}
\label{sec:hoods}

Local exhaust ventilation is the primary method used to control
inhalation exposures to hazardous substances. The laboratory hood is
the most common local exhaust method used. Other methods include
vented enclosures for large pieces of equipment or chemical storage,
and snorkel types of exhaust for capturing contaminants near the point
of release. Some systems are equipped with air cleaning devices (HEPA
filters or carbon adsorbers).

{\em It is advisable to use a laboratory hood when working with all
hazardous substances.} In addition, a laboratory hood or other
suitable containment device must be used for all work with
``particularly hazardous substances'' (see
Section~\ref{sec:particularly_hazardous}). A properly operating and
correctly used laboratory hood can control the vapors released from
volatile liquids as well as dust and mists.

Do not make any modifications to hoods or duct work without first
calling the Department Administrative Officer and the Industrial
Hygiene Program (452-3477). Any changes made to the local exhaust
system must by approved by the Industrial Hygiene Program. Do not use
a laboratory hood for large pieces of equipment unless the hood is
dedicated to this use (large obstructions can change the airflow
patterns and render the hood unsafe for other uses). It is generally
more effective to install a specifically designed enclosure for large
equipment so that the laboratory hood can be used for its intended
purpose.

The Industrial Hygiene Program annually inspects all laboratory hoods
on campus. This inspection consists of measuring the face velocity of
the hood and using a smoke stick to check its containment
effectiveness visually. If the laboratory hood passes both the face
velocity and smoke containment tests, then it is posted with an
updated certification label. If the hood does not pass and the problem
is so severe that the hood is unsafe for use, then it is labeled with
a ``DO NOT USE'' sign.

If a hood fails inspection due to a problem that the Department of
Facilities can correct (e.g., a slipping fan belt, cracked duct work,
etc.)  then the Industrial Hygiene Program (IHP) will submit a work
order to have it repaired. The Department of Facilities will notify
the IHP when the repairs have been made, and the fume hood is then
reinspected. If a hood functions poorly due to incorrect use then the
IHP will notify the DLC EHS Coordinator. It is the responsibility of
researchers and lab supervisors to notify the IHP if any hoods in
their laboratory do not have an updated certification label.

{\bf If there is any question about a laboratory hood's operation,
then the Industrial Hygiene Program should be called immediately.}
When a new laboratory hood is installed, it is the responsibility of
the laboratory supervisor to ensure that no hazardous substances are
used in the hood until it is surveyed and labeled by the Industrial
Hygiene Program. If any changes of any kind are made to the laboratory
hood system, the Industrial Hygiene Program should be notified so that
a new hood inspection can be conducted.

The following general rules should be followed when using laboratory
hoods:

\begin{itemize}
\item No hoods should be used for work involving hazardous substances
unless it has a certification label less than one year old.

\item
Always keep hazardous chemicals at least six inches behind the plane
of the sash.

\item
Never put your head inside an operating laboratory hood to check an
experiment. The plane of the sash is the barrier between contaminated
and uncontaminated air.

\item
Work with the hood sash in the lowest possible position. The sash will
then act as a physical barrier in the event of an accident in the
hood. Keep the sash closed when not conducting work in the hood.

\item
Do not clutter your hood with bottles or equipment. Keep it clean and
clear.  Only materials actively in use should be in the hood. This
will provide optimal containment and reduce the risk of extraneous
chemicals being involved in any fire or explosion which may occur in
the hood.

\item
Clean the grill along the bottom slot of the hood regularly so it does
not become clogged with papers and dirt.

\item
Promptly report any suspected hood malfunctions to the Industrial
Hygiene Program (452-3477).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fire Extinguishers}

Laboratory supervisors are required to instruct new personnel in the
location of fire extinguishers, safety showers, and eyewashes before
they begin research in the laboratory. It is MIT policy that personnel
are not required to extinguish fires that occur in their work
areas. Researchers are not permitted to use fire extinguishers unless
they have attended a Fire Extinguisher Training Session presented by
the MIT EHS Office. Contact 2-3477 for information on the schedule of
fire extinguisher training sessions.

All laboratories should be outfitted with fire extinguishers. All fire
extinguishers should be mounted on a wall in an area free of clutter
or stored in a fire extinguisher cabinet. Research personnel should be
familiar with the location, use, and classification of the
extinguishers in their laboratory.

Any time a fire extinguisher is used, no matter for how brief a
period, it should be inspected and recharged. For recharging,
replacement, inspection, or information regarding the type of
extinguisher best suited for your laboratory, call the MIT Operations
Center.

\subsection{Safety Showers and Eyewash Facilities}

Every laboratory in which hazardous substances are in use must be
equipped with an unobstructed {\bf safety shower} and {\bf eyewash
facility} that meets the requirements of OSHA regulations (29 CFR
1910.151(c)).

In each lab, the EHS Representative is responsible for checking
eyewashes once a week by running the water for one minute. This will
flush out any bacteria that grow in the stagnant water. If an eyewash
or safety shower needs to be repaired, call the Department of
Facilities and give the operator the location of the defective
equipment and (for safety showers) the number on the blue preventive
maintenance tag.


\section{Chemical Container Labeling Guidelines}

Labeling is important for safe management of chemicals, preventing
accidental misuse, inadvertent mixing of incompatible chemicals, and
facilitating proper chemical storage. Proper labeling helps assure
quick response in the event of an accident, such as a chemical spill
or chemical exposure incident. Finally, proper labeling prevents the
high costs associated with disposal of unknown chemicals.

With few exceptions, all chemical containers at MIT must be labeled
with chemical name. Chemical name can mean an acronym or shorthand
abbreviation if a cross-reference between the fully written chemical
name and its associated short-hand name is posted in the work
area. However, shorthand or abbreviated chemical names are never
allowed on hazardous waste collection containers.

\subsection{Labeling Requirements by Type of Container}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Original containers, as received from the manufacturer.}
Chemicals received from outside vendors or from stockrooms of
laboratory supply rooms will have labels indicating the chemical name,
manufacturer name and address, physical hazard, health hazard, and
target organ. Upon receipt of a chemical, the containers should be
checked to assure labels are not removed or defaced, and a date of
receipt should be put on the label. If incoming containers are not
properly labeled, the chemical supplier should be contacted
immediately to correct the problem.

\item {\bf Durable containers} means those containers that are not
provided by the manufacturer, but that hold chemicals decanted from a
larger container that will be used only in one work area usually for
longer than a day. All durable containers of chemicals that have been
decanted from a large quantity container must be labeled with the
chemical name, concentration, person responsible, and date. For
non-laboratory areas, the label must contain physical hazard and
health hazard information. For laboratory areas, it is suggested the
label contain physical and health hazard information, when feasible,
since this information will be needed if the material becomes excess
or waste and this information can assist in determining proper storage
for the material. Labels for this purpose are available at Lab Supply
stockroom.

\item {\bf Containers of chemicals prepared in the laboratory} means
those containers used by researchers to contain materials synthesized
or otherwise generated in the laboratory that will be maintained for
longer than one day. All containers of chemicals prepared in the
laboratory must be marked with the chemical name, person responsible,
and date. It is suggested that the label contain physical hazard and
health hazard information. Options for labeling small containers are
provided under special circumstances below. 

Note: If the container is transferred or shipped to a user outside the
immediate work area, a complete label is required, to include the
chemical contents, the physical and health hazard information, target
organ information, and the name and address of the
generator. Immediate work area does not necessarily mean a single
room. A single work area can consist of multiple rooms that are used
for similar processes (e.g. suite of labs under the control of a
single Principal Investigator). Distinct processes, staff, and persons
responsible for the area generally define different work
areas. Contact the EHS Office for assistance with labeling and
shipping.

\item {\bf Transient containers} means those containers that will be
used to hold chemicals for less than one work day and that will be
under the control of the person filling the container. No labeling is
required of these containers unless they are not emptied by the end of
the work day or unless they are no longer under the control of the
person who prepared the material. Examples include solutions that will
be used immediately in an experiment or cleaning solutions that will
be used by the end of a work day.  It should be noted that transient
containers can be inadvertently left unlabeled at the end of the day,
so consideration should be given to labeling them in accordance with
the requirements for durable containers whenever possible.

\item {\bf Hazardous waste collection containers} means those
containers used to collect used or excess chemicals for pickup by the
EHS Office. These types of containers are subject to hazardous waste
regulations. The following information should be provided on these
containers: the full chemical name and the percent composition of the
chemical for mixtures. Chemical hazard information should also be
provided. For details, contact EHS. Red tags are available from the
EHS Office for labeling these containers. Contact the EHS Office at
2-3477, or visit the EHS website to order red tags.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Special Circumstances}

Small containers, such as vials and test tubes, can be labeled as a
group by labeling the outer container (i.e., rack or
box). Alternatively, a placard can be used to label the storage
location for small containers (i.e., shelf, refrigerator, etc.) An
additional option for labeling small containers is to label them with
a code number or name, and have that code listed in a readily
available log book or sheet with information on the chemical name,
date generated, and person responsible. The log book or sheet should
be available in the area where the chemical is used and stored, and
should be retained in the area as long as the chemical is present. All
personnel working in the area should be familiar with the location of
such log books and sheets and should know how to determine the
contents of materials labeled using a code.

\subsection{Exceptions}

All containers must be labeled as to chemical name unless it is a
transient container, as noted above. However, additional labeling
requirements do not apply to the following items: consumer products,
food and food products labeled in accordance with the Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act; samples and specimens received in a lab for testing when
the exact composition is not known; and pesticides labeled in
accordance with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide
Act.

Containers of practically non-toxic and relatively harmless chemicals
are also exempt from other labeling requirements so long as they are
labeled with the chemical name.

\section{Chemical Waste Management}
\label{sec:waste}

\subsection{Policy}

Hazardous waste may be generated from laboratory operations,
construction and renovation activities, photo processing, and a
variety of other activities at the Institute. The proper disposal of
waste chemicals at the Institute is of serious concern, and every
effort must be made to do it safely and efficiently. The
responsibility for the identification and proper management of waste
chemicals within the Institute rests with the individuals who have
generated the waste.


\subsection{Training}

All personnel using hazardous chemicals must complete the training
requirements on handling and disposing of hazardous waste as outlined
in Section\ref{sec:lab_training}.


\subsection{Procedures}

The following summary provides a general overview of regulatory
requirements applicable to hazardous waste generators.


\subsubsection{Waste Identification}

Hazardous waste includes materials that possess hazardous
characteristics (e.g. toxic, ignitable, corrosive or reactive), or
substances that are listed as hazardous waste by the regulatory
agencies.

Separate containers should be used for different categories of
chemical wastes and the container should be compatible with the waste
contained.  Empty containers in the lab can be reused for collecting
hazardous waste provided the old label is removed or completely
defaced. Only compatible chemicals should be combined in a
container. Any chemicals spilled on the outside of the container must
be immediately cleaned off. Containers, which store hazardous waste,
must be properly and clearly labeled. Labels must include: 1) the
words ``Hazardous Waste''; 2) the chemical names of constituents
(e.g. ``ethanol''); 3) the hazards associated with the waste in words
(e.g. ``TOXIC''). The label must be dated as soon as a satellite
accumulation container becomes filled. Hazardous waste labels are
available from the Environmental Management Program.

\subsubsection{Accumulation and Storage}

The Institute allows two types of hazardous waste management areas:
less than 90-day storage areas and areas that are often referred to as
satellite accumulation areas (SAA).

\paragraph{Satellite Accumulation} SAA must be established at the point
of generation and remain under the control of the person generating
the waste. SAAs are defined by trays or tubs used for secondary
containment and are to be posted with green labels stating ``Hazardous
Waste Satellite Accumulation Area''. A maximum of 55 gallons of
hazardous waste or 1 quart of acutely hazardous waste are permitted at
each satellite accumulation area. Only one container is allowed per
waste stream. Satellite accumulation containers must be closed unless
waste is being added to the container. Containers of incompatible
wastes must be stored in separate secondary containment trays.

Once a hazardous waste container is filled, the label must be dated
and the container removed from the satellite accumulation area within
three days.  Environmental Management Program provides a pick-up
service for the waste ready for disposal, or you can move those
containers to a less than 90 day storage area if one is
available. Waste pick-up can be requested online at
\url{http://web.mit.edu/environment/ehs/chem\_collection.html} or by
calling the Environmental Management Program of EHS (x 2-EHSS).

\paragraph{Less than 90 day Storage Area} The storage areas must meet the same
requirements as the satellite accumulation areas except for the amount
and type of waste stored. However, the maximum storage time cannot
exceed 90 days.  Environmental Management Program will set up and
manage your less than 90-day storage area.


\paragraph{Inspections}
Hazardous waste areas (satellite accumulation areas and storage areas)
must be inspected on a weekly basis. Personnel managing satellite
accumulation areas are responsible for conducting their areas
inspection. Environmental Management Program personnel conduct the
weekly inspection of all hazardous waste storage areas.


\subsubsection{Waste Minimization}

Plan a procedure for waste disposal before you start on a
project. Label waste properly. It is up to each department, group, or
researcher to identify waste materials properly before disposal;
inadvertent mixing of incompatible materials could have serious
consequences.

Protection of the environment makes the disposal of large quantities
of chemical and solid wastes a difficult problem. It is in everyone's
best interest to keep quantities of waste to a minimum.

The following suggestions may help:

\begin{itemize}
\item Order only the amount of material you need for your project or
experiment even if you can get twice as much for the same money.

\item
Use only the amount of material that is needed for conclusive results.

\item
Avoid storing excess material, particularly if it is an extremely
toxic or flammable material, just because you may want it in the
future.

\item
Before disposing of unwanted, unopened, uncontaminated chemicals check
with others in your department who may be able to use them.

\item
On termination of a research project or completion of a thesis, all
unused chemicals to be kept by the laboratory shall be labeled.

\item
Make sure all samples and products to be disposed of are properly
identified, labeled with its chemical name and containerized. Do not
leave them for others to clean up after you.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Special Procedures}

\subsubsection{Unknown Waste Chemicals}

Unknown waste chemicals cannot be accepted for disposal. It is the
responsibility of the department involved to identify all chemicals
and this may require polling laboratory personnel, students and
faculty members to ascertain the owner of such unknown waste and its
identity. If identification is not possible, the Environmental
Management Program can arrange for analysis of unknown materials and
the Principal Investigator/Lab Group will be responsible for the cost
of analysis and disposal.

\subsubsection{Solvents}
Organic solvents must not be put down the drain.  Regulations which
apply to MIT's sewer system prohibit the discharge of organic solvents
into the sewer system.  This applies to all organic solvents whether
flammable or nonflammable, miscible or non miscible with water.
Organic solvents should be placed in suitable containers where there
is no danger that vapors or the liquid will escape.  Containers shall
be capped tightly, labeled prominently, and sent to the waste chemical
storage area.  Mixtures of organic solvents that are compatible and
confined in one container must be identified with an estimated
proportion in fractions or percentages of each solvent in the mixture.

\subsubsection{Ether}
Ether that is in cans must be transferred to glass bottles or plastic
coated bottles and diluted with water before being sent to the storage
area.

\subsubsection{Acids/Bases}

Acids and alkaline solutions may be placed in proper containers
tightly capped, labeled and sent to the waste chemical storage area.
Many laboratory operations create neutralized acids and alkaline
solutions which may be put down the drain providing that they do not
contain heavy metals or toxic contaminants.  Concentrated acid and
caustics may be sent to the waste storage area in proper containers
tightly capped and labeled.

\subsubsection{Salts} 

Inorganic and organic solids in their original containers that are
designated as waste because they are contaminated, old or of
questionable purity, may be sent to the storage area.

\subsubsection{Mercury}

Mercury must be removed from lab apparatus and put into jars or
bottles before sending to the storage area.  Broken mercury
thermometers must be put into a jar or secondary container.  Clean up
materials from a mercury spill may be containerized, labeled and set
to the storage area.  Any laboratory or department that is interested
in sending mercury to be distilled, and to receive a credit for the
same, must take the responsibility of getting the mercury to the
proper disposal vendor.

\subsubsection{Toxics}

Cyanide compounds, arsenic lead, and heavy metal wastes should be
placed in bottles and containers, sealed tightly, labeled, and sent to
the chemical waste storage area.

\subsubsection{Flammable Metals}

Alkali metals such as sodium and potassium should be placed in
suitable container, covered with Nujol (mineral oil), labeled
properly, sealed so that there is not possibility of their coming in
contact with water and sent to the waste chemical storage area.

Pyrophoric metals such as magnesium, strontium, thorium, and
zirconium, and other pyrophoric chips and fine powders should be
placed in a metal container, sealed tightly, labeled, and sent to the
waste chemical storage area.

\subsubsection{Oils}

Small quantities of vacuum pump oil or lubricating oils in 1 gallon
containers or less may be sent to the waste chemical storage area.


\subsubsection{Gas Cylinders}

Gas cylinders are to be returned to the supplier. Some small lecture
bottles are nonreturnable which become a disposal problem when empty
or near empty with a residual amount of gas. The Environmental
Management Program will arrange for disposal of lecture
bottles. However, the Principal Investigator/Lab Group is responsible
for the cost of disposal.

\subsubsection{Controlled Drugs}
Controlled drugs to be discarded can not be disposed of as hazardous
waste.  The handling, records, and disposal of controlled drugs are
the responsibility of the department involved operating within the
Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) Regulations. However, the Environmental
Management Program can provide assistance during the process.

\subsubsection{Radioactive Waste}
Radioactive waste disposal is handled in accordance with procedures
established by the Radiation Protection Program. Wastes marked as
radioactive must not be sent to the waste chemical storage area.

\subsubsection{Biological Waste}
Biological waste is handled in accordance with procedures set forth by
the Biosafety Program. Wastes marked as biohazardous must not be sent
to the waste chemical storage area. Autoclave or chemically neutralize
waste and dispose of as regular or sharps waste. Complete and attach
appropriate tags prior to disposal.

\subsubsection{Sharps Waste}
\paragraph{Chemically contaminated} sharps waste
must be packaged in puncture proof containers and must be labeled as
Hazardous Waste with the chemical contaminants listed. Containers must
be managed in accordance with hazardous waste regulations. {\em
Chemically contaminated sharps waste must not be packaged in Biohazard
containers.}

\paragraph{Biohazardous and infectious} shaps waste must be packaged in
puncture proof Biohazard containers and is handled in accordance with
procedures set forth by the Biosafety Program. {\em All non-chemically
contaminated sharps waste originating from a BL rated laboratory is
considered to be Biohazardous.}

\paragraph{Clean needles and syringes} are considered to be ``Medical
Waste'' and must be packaged in puncture proof containers. No tags are
needed, but lab number and PI name must be marked on the container. If
the lab produces a large volume of needles and syringes, a BioSystems
container will be provided and a regular pick-up schedule will be
arranged.

\paragraph{Cleaned and rinsed} glass bottles, glassware, broken
glass, wires, tooth picks, razor blades, and other sharps from non-BL
rated laboratories should be collected in a in a VWR glass box or
other sturdy puncture resistant cardboard or plastic container. Any
chemical labels must be defaced. Mark the box clean broken glass with
the lab and person responsible. When full, tape shut and secure. Place
containers in the hall.  Custodians will pick up. If there are any
problems or questions, contact Kevin Healy, Recycling Coordinator, at
x3-6360 or khealy\@mit.edu. {\em No chemical, radioactive, biological
or hazardous waste residue.}


\section{Signs and Symptoms of Chemical Exposure}
\label{sec:symptoms}

The hazards of laboratory chemicals can be ascertained by referring to
label and MSDS information, as well as additional health and safety
reference materials. In addition, the ability to recognize the signs
and symptoms of chemical exposure is important. Then, if adverse
effects do arise despite all precautions taken to avoid exposure,
those effects can be recognized early and appropriate action
taken. Actions to take if chemical exposure has occurred include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Seeking prompt medical attention.
\item Contacting the Principal Investigator, Chemical Hygiene Officer
and the EHS Office.  
\end{itemize}


Some signs and symptoms of chemical exposure include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Skin that has become dried, whitened, reddened, swelled,
blistered, and itchy or exhibits a rash.
\item A chemical odor. Many chemicals can be smelled at concentrations
well below harmful levels. On the other hand, a chemical may be
present without a detectable odor.
\item A chemical taste. Some chemicals have characteristic tastes.
\item Tearing or burning of the eyes.
\item Burning sensations of the skin, nose or throat.
\item Cough.
\item Headache or dizziness.
\end{itemize}

These general symptoms may also be associated with conditions other
than chemical exposure. The signs and symptoms of exposure to specific
chemicals are contained in the ``Health Hazard Information'' section
of the MSDS.  Laboratory personnel should be aware of the signs and
symptoms of exposure to the chemicals they use.

\section{Emergency Procedures}
\label{sec:emergency}

\subsection{Spills}

Minor hazardous materials or waste spills that present no immediate
threat to personnel safety, health, or to the environment can be
cleaned up by laboratory personnel that use the materials or generate
the waste. A minor hazardous material spill is generally defined as a
spill of material that is not highly toxic, is not spilled in large
quantity, does not present a significant fire hazard, can be recovered
before it is released to the environment, and is not in a public area
such as a common hallway. Such a spill can usually be controlled and
cleaned up by one or two personnel.

Major hazardous material and waste spills should be reported to the
MIT emergency number (x100) to receive immediate professional
assistance and support in the control and clean up of the spilled
material. Major hazardous materials or waste spills are generally
defined as having a significant threat to safety, health, or the
environment. These spills generally are a highly toxic material or is
spilled in large quantity, may present a significant fire hazard,
cannot be recovered before it is released to the environment, or is
spilled in a public area such as a common hallway. Upon reporting such
a spill, personnel should stand by at a safe distance to guide
responders and spill clean up experts to the spill area. Reporting
personnel should also keep other personnel from entering into the
spill area.

In the case of a spill that presents a situation immediately dangerous
to life or health, or a situation with significant risk of a fire,
personnel should evacuate the area and summon emergency assistance by
dialing the MIT emergency number (x100), activating a fire alarm
station, or both.

Hazardous material users and hazardous waste generators must be aware
of the properties of the materials they use and the waste they
generate. Properties of materials are most commonly found in material
safety data sheets and many publications. A good guide to finding
other sources of information is found in {\em Prudent Practices in the
Laboratory.}


\subsection{Accidents}

For all accidents requiring emergency police, fire, or medical
response, contact Campus Police at 617-253-1212 or 100 from an MIT
telephone.

An {\em MIT Emergency Response Guide} should be posted in every
laboratory in an area accessible to all. This guide outlines the
procedures to follow for most types of emergency situations. The MIT
Emergency Response Guide is available electronically at
\url{http://web.mit.edu/environment/pdf/MITERG.pdf}

In addition, {\em Emergency Action Plans} are required for each DLC
under the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA). All
staff and students should be familiar with their laboratory's
Emergency Action Plan, as it specifies the appropriate response and
building exit plans for a variety of life-safety emergency situations.

\section{Shipping Hazardous Materials}
\label{sec:shipping}

The transportation of hazardous materials and compressed gases over
public roads or by air is strictly governed by Federal and State
regulations.  Dangerous goods include:
\begin{itemize}
\item explosives (class 1)
\item compressed gases (class 2)
\item flammable liquids (class 3)
\item other flammables, e.g. spontaneously combustible materials
(class 4)
\item oxidizers --- oxygen sources (class 5)
\item poisonous/toxic substances (class 6)
\item biohazardous materials (class 6)
\item radioactive material (class 7)
\item corrosive materials (class 8)
\item miscellaneous hazards, e.g. dry ice and asbestos (class 9)
\end{itemize}

Any shipment of these items that is to travel over public roads or by
air must comply with regulations regarding quantity, packaging, and
labeling.  The principle regulations are the U.S. Department of
Transportation (DOT) 49 CFR 100-185, regulations for shipping
hazardous materials. Information can be accessed at
\url{http://hazmat.dot.gov/} Personnel who intend to ship or convey
these items over public roads by Institute or personal vehicles must
contact the EHS Office for packaging and labeling instructions or
receive training through the EHS Office.

Shipping requirements include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Classify the hazardous material to be shipped, using the class
designations above.

\item Select a proper shipping name and determine maximum quantity
being shipped.

\item Determine proper packaging requirements.

\item Pack the material according to manufacturers instructions and to
prevent leaks.

\item Mark and label package with proper shipping name, hazard label,
and contact information.

\item Complete documentation (declaration of dangerous goods) and
retain a copy on site for 375 days.

\item Check for additional permit requirements (e.g. import permits
and select agent transport permits).
\end{itemize}

Individuals who sign hazardous materials manifests and shipping papers
and those who package hazardous material for shipment must be trained
and certified by the EHS office. For more information, the EHS Office
offers two awareness courses, ``Shipping Hazardous Chemicals Awareness''
and ``Shipping Biohazardous Materials Awareness.''

\part{Lab-Specific Safety Practices}

\section{\DLC Procedures}

Additional SOPs must be developed for any operation or hazardous
material for which the general safety procedures contained in Part II
of this Chemical Hygiene Plan are inadequate to address hazards. These
procedures must be written to clearly identify additional or special
precautions, controls, personal protective equipment and emergency
procedures that are required, as well as the nature of the hazards the
procedure is intended to minimize. Each SOP must be reviewed by the
Chemical Hygiene Officer (CHO).

An SOP that addresses the requirements noted above must be documented
and maintained in Part III of this Chemical Hygiene Plan. The EHS
Office is available to assist laboratory personnel in the development
of SOPs.

\subsection{SOP Template Instructions}

A SOP should contain the following sections and information.

\subsubsection{Description}

This section of the SOP should include the title of the procedure, the
authors, and the last revision date. All revisions must be reviewed by
the Chemical Hygiene Officer.

\subsubsection{Scope and Applicability}

This section should include a general description of what activities
are covered under this procedure. List any specific examples of when
the procedure must be implemented or any exemptions when the procedure
is not required. If authorization for this procedure is limited to
designated staff, that fact should be noted in this section.

\subsubsection{Materials and Hazards}

A description of the hazardous materials needed for the procedure
should be listed.  Material Safety Data Sheets should be obtained and
attached to the procedures template. Many operations can result in
secondary materials or hazardous by-products. A discussion of these
materials should be included in this section if they represent a
significant, but different hazard than the other materials.

The description of equipment and instrumentation should be limited to
any items utilized to control or monitor specific hazards associated
with the material or the operation. Conduct a comprehensive Personal
Protective Equipment (PPE) evaluation for the referenced materials or
operation. The determination should include both the type of
equipment, as well as the clothing materials. The results from this
evaluation should be identified by completing the PPE and Clothing
tables. Questions regarding the selection or procurement process
should be directed to the Chemical Hygiene Officer.

\subsubsection{Special Precautions}

Indicate and describe any management approvals, medical surveillance,
training or specific permits that must be obtained in order to conduct
this procedure. Questions regarding applicability of these categories
should be directed to the Chemical Hygiene Officer.

\subsubsection{Procedure}

Enumerate or list the safety steps to be followed in performing the
procedure. The steps should be sufficiently detailed, and should
include any prohibited activities or any potentially dangerous
conditions.

\subsubsection{Special Emergency Procedures}

Generic information related to emergency response activities is
already addressed in Section~\ref{sec:emergency}. List any additional
or specific equipment, supplies or procedures that are unique to the
referenced materials or operation. For example, an antidote should be
present whenever work is conducted with hydrofluoric acid.
