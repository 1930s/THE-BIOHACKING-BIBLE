* Bustamante group - Cornell
* Ian Holmes - Berkeley

== Words to Look Up ==

== Talk ==
* used to select positive selecction
* omega - defined as the nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio
** < 1 - purifying selection
** == 1 - neutral evolution
** > 1 - positive selection

= Richard Goldstein : Mon-equilibrium models - modeling the evolution of extremophiles =
Tue Jun 26 13:34:37 EDT 2007

== Words to Look Up ==
* Levy skew alpha stable distribution
** Gassian special case
** lorentzian special case
** big tails
** more gen central limit theorum

== Talk ==
* can treat evolution of Optimal Growth Temperature within a phylogenetic framework
* chonges in OGT in Bact and archaea show strongly non-normal behav
** large skew - non-neg tail
* GC content (avg over codens) does not chang much w/ AA comp change
* interesting changes in composition, reflecting T-dependence of intramolecular interactions
* mentioned Shakhnovich PLoS Comp Bio paper

== Questions ==
* compare thermophiles to antifreeze proteins?
