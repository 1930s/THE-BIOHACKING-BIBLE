===Aim===

The aim of this experiment was to make a calibration curve to be able to convert Abs490, which is measured by the plate reader, into OD600.

===Method===

*A dilution series of different OD600s was created using the in-lab spectrophotometer and overnight culture of cells.
*These dilutions were also assessed via the spectrophotometer to make sure they were near their targetted OD.
*3 x 200{{ul}} of each dilution was pipetted into a 96 well plate and then Abs490 was read by the Victor3 plate-reader
*The cells and the dilutions were kept on ice to prevent any increase in OD

===Results===
