More results to be posted soon.

Results for RAE-tagged are not that great, but maybe I'm just not used to the small range (not a huge difference between induced and non-induced).

=9/12=

Using only TS3 today because of yesterday's results. 

Induced w/ different concentrations of IPTG, incubate at 37C. Will split into two aliquots each: one to be washed pre-addition of OHHL, others left w/ all IPTG and then OHHL addition. Plate reader to be run overnight.

=9/13=

Induced with different amounts of IPTG (9 different concentrations), incubated for 2.5 hr, took ODs. Diluted to same OD, spun down pellets in microcentrifuge tube, put in box in my freezer. 

Also, collected data from last night's overnight run.

<br>"Washed" corresponds to a 3x wash with PBS before reconstitution in LB+Amp+Kan to an OD analogous to the "nonwashed" control sample.


[[IMAGE: 913shloiptggrowthwash.jpg]]

=9/14=
Ran direct magnetic binding assay with senders and non-tagged const. GFP, testing for noninduced binding and the like. Results were not spectacular. Control plates indicate that noninduced senders have a growth advantage, but when induced, const. GFP has the growth advantage. 

More data to come.

=9/15=

More plate reader - exploring washing after IPTG induction, detecting growth of fluorescence. 

Also, another direct magnetic selection assay with tagged receivers (iptg-induced, washed, grown again, then selected for).

Results from Yesterday

==Selection/targeting plates==

6.8x enrichment:<br>
[[IMAGE: 915shloselectionpies.jpg]]
<br> 
Control corresponds to non-induced tagged sender with equal amount of induced, tagged receiver. (no selection, just plating). As expected, the noninduced sender seems to grow much better (about 10x). 

Experimental corresponds to strep-tagged receiver (induced) with his-tagged sender (noninduced). Selection for receiver was performed using streptactin beads. Compared to control, 6.8x enrichment. 

Not shown: I tried strep-receiver (induced) with strep-tagged sender (noninduced), with streptactin beads. Since senders were noninduced, I still expected enrichment of receiver. Instead, I got both senders and receivers, and at a ratio analogous to the control. This indicates that the senders may be sticky even without induction; however, due to the experimental result above, I suspect the stickiness (leakiness of expression) still lends itself to specificity (eg, the noninduced his-sender does not stick to streptactin, but noninduced strep-sender does). My next assay will involve testing for enrichment capabilities *without* induction at all since IPTG seems so intrusive on fluorescence expression.


Also promising:<br>
[[IMAGE: enrichment915shlocomp.jpg]]

==Plate Reader==

Results show that washed cells display fluorescence growth significantly higher than non-washed cells, but in longer run, noninduced cells still show 2x as much absolute fluorescence. Perhaps more washes / growth before OHHL induction will allow for more fluorescence growth from washed samples. The two graphs below are adjusted for initial GFP values (equilibrated between samples). Graphs are also available with samples starting from the same OD (but not same GFP, apparently; perhaps washing [and almost definitely induction] negatively affects this). These will be posted soon.

[[IMAGE:915shloTs3iptgline.jpg]]


[[IMAGE:015shloRs2linear.jpg]]

=9/17=

Started another plate reader (re-do from summer work, exploring ratios of sender vs receiver). 


Also, another plate selection assay to see whether noninduced cells stick/are enriched enough to be used without induction.

=9/18=

==Yesterday's Plate Reader Results==

[[IMAGE: 917shloratiosendrecGFP.jpg]]
<br>
Above shows that the optimal ratio for eventual GFP may be around 15 receiver, 5 sender.

=9/20=

Growing up some cultures: will start with nickel plates tomorrow.

=9/22=

Nickel Plate Results (all averages of 4-6 wells each). Assay involved measuring ODs on both the photospectrometer and the plate reader, binding in a 37C shaking plate reader over 30 minutes. Afterward, the supernatant was removed from each well, and the well was refilled with LB. These results are shown below. 

As shown in the graph below, the addition of equal ODs of His-sender (specific) and Strep-sender (nonspecific) results in a greater final OD left on the Nickel-plate for the specifically-bound senders.  <br>
[[IMAGE: shlo0922finalODrefill.jpg]]

[[IMAGE: shlo0922percentOD.jpg]]


Additional parts of assay included washing with imidazole 3x (10 min shaking, per wash). The clear plate was again refilled with LB. The final OD after washes was extremely low for all samples, with no distinction between specific and nonspecific binding; I suspect that the washing was too vigorous (or the imidazole, at 50mM, too high in concentration), and all specifically bound cells were washed away as well, leaving only small residues. This is a step that may be improved, should I attempt to repeat this experiment for greater enrichment. I also wonder if it is worth repeating this experiment, allowing for binding in a longer time frame (perhaps 1 hr instead of 30 minutes), which may also increase enrichment.

==Additional results (added 9/24)==

Redoing selection assay, except with receivers. Need to figure out control for the addition of sender.

Preliminary Graphs 

[[IMAGE:shlo092507niplateprelim.jpg]]


=9/27=

The following shows "dilutions" of senders (actually, added in various amounts of other non-RFP cells). It fits a linear eq pretty well: <br>
[[IMAGE:928shlofluordata.jpg]]
<br>
[[IMAGE:928shlowashdata.jpg]]
<br>
<br>
The image below shows that the washed wells showed no drastic increases in fluorescence, as the synthetic-OHHL-treated nonwashed wells did. This indicates that I may be washing away so many receiver cells that no fluorescence is detected, or I am not waiting long enough to detect substantial fluorescence increases (... I would have to start with a larger OD in my kinetic run, since the plates are almost all drying out already by the end of the 24 hr assay). In my re-do assay, perhaps I should not wash with imidazole at all, or allow the cells to bind for longer (though these already bound for 1.5 hr) before washes. <br>
[[IMAGE:928shlogfpfinal.jpg]]

=9/30=

Redoing assay ... realized that I should bind senders first, then wash, then add receiver, since we probably need a lot less sender than receiver for detectable fluorescence.

I had washed w/ PBS (no imidazole) because I was afraid the imidazole was preventing all binding. This turned out to be a bad idea because I got a lot of nonspecific binding; that is to say, the strep binding was similar to the his. I did show that, with the amount of his-senders that were left in the well, I was able to activate the GFP expression for the receivers: 

(These results are also sketchy because the plate reader was unplugged by someone in the lab accidentally, so I don't know how growth really went ..., and they weren't at 37 or shaking). 

[[IMAGE: shlo09301.jpg]]


It's also worth noting that the cells were not washed after receiver was added, so I don't know how well the receivers are binding. I guess I want to make sure I get enrichment (almost NO strep ... or detectable difference in fluorescence growth curves, not available for this experiment) before I move onto that. That's the next step: bind senders, wash, bind receivers, wash, grow.

=10/01=

For today's new assay, I washed with imidazole, tested same things (see yesterday). Hopefully will get no GFP in the strep-sender lanes.


Results: 
*I am unable to fully prevent binding of strep (nonspecific); GFP response is same for both strep and his - should be much higher for his. 
*Need to do more washes in future?

=10/06=

*More washes done for longer
*Results still inconclusive / bad. 
*Fluorescence on this clear plate doesn't seem to be going that well.

*Colony PCR: Cotransformations

Things I need to do:


*Grow up successful Mek-tagged bacteria. Miniprep, digest, extract vector from LppOmpA1 and insert and ligate/transform into BL21 (DE3)s. 
**Cotransform (via electroporation) with S23I and T02. 
*Grow up successful Mek-tagged bacteria (doesn't matter whether they're cotransformed yet, but should be in BL21(DE3), obvi). Do magnetic bead assay with Prot-A coated beads, Lpp-OmpA-pdz (cotransformed, so that fluorescent proteins distinguish the bacteria). 
*Grow up successful cotransformed bacteria for magnetic assays - perhaps one without Mek, just to ensure the pdz domains still are functional, and then with Mek to see whether the cells will aggregate. 
*Use microscope to visualize said Mek-pdz interactions.

For some reason my clonewell only gives me the vector and not the Mek (500bp) insert. I'm going to redo the Mek col PCR and Mek miniprep, but continue with the extraction of vector ...

Electroporation (cotransformation) of Mek's with SI and JT. Wanted to do a third with T02 but can't find miniprep. (should make more myself)

Controls for selection assay didn't grow up - I might have to throw away that (really old) master plate and make a new one. Started growing up new controls when I got to lab;  not sure they'll be grown enough for an assay this afternoon. 


IPTG-induced Mek and pdz samples.



Performed selection assay, grew up T02 and S23I (nontagged) for new master plate and miniprep. 

=11/21=

Moved plates into fridge because I needed to leave for Thanksgiving - unable to count colonies. Also, set aside some T02/S23I for miniprep and master-plating (in fridge - should hopefully be okay when I return on ... Sunday? ... to tend to them).

Colony counts and miniprep of SI, T02, and I22. Cotransformations for later this week?

==Other notes== 


Colony notes: 
*Sample 1, with bead and Mek alone, had a few residual colonies but much fewer (maybe roughly 1/5 the amount?) compared to selection plates. 
*Sample 2: bead, OmpA1-Mek and pdz-SI: looks like it has "mixed" colonies on selection plate! Wonder where I can take this ...?
*Controls had too many colonies; hard to compare any results with anything.

<br> ... attempt to incr concentration of primer ...

<br> ... you can see I stuck in too much miniprep - I just wanted to see if it would work if I put in more. it evidently didn't.
