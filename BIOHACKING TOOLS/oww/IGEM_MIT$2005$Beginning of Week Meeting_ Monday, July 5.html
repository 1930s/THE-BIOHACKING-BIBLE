===Top Priority (can be done today)===
#Figuring out fusion point - where to attach ToxR to scFvs. Need help reading paper.
#*Why was this place chosen on other papers? Use this to help figure this.
#*What else did they try? What didn't work, why?
#*Look at references from article.
#Specify this week -> next week's experiments. 
#Controls, what to expect
#Getting cells from Harvard - learning about them, reading papers.
#Order Biobricks
#*In parallel: order primers to make BioBricks in lab.
#*scFvs 1-3
#*ToxR 

===To Do This Week===
*How to get library of fluorecein dimers
*Get ToxR and ToxR-cI plasmids from Harvard

===Converting to BioBrickism===
*Get rid of incorrect restriction sites, attach biobrick ends.
*See codon usage to ensure efficiency in transcription. (Take out rare codons)
*Biobrick domains. Allow for exchange of scFv easily.
====Issues====
*Protein domains - LD linker is fixed.
