In the event of an Evacuation (i.e. Fire Alarm activated) all members of the lab should meet and check in at the following location:


*Primary = Stata Center
**Outside the entrance between the two towers that faces the biology parking lot (near the Cafe)
**In the event of inclement weather, just inside this entrance


*Secondary = Media lab
**Outside the main entrance/lobby
**In the event of inclement weather, just inside this building


The Secondary meeting location should be used if the Primary location cannot be reach.


If the evacuation occurs late in the day, please proceed to the meeting location and check in before heading home so that we can account for everyone who was in the building.


The Lab Fire Marshall is [[Jason Kelly]].
