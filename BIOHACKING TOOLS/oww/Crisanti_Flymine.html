On '''FRIDAY 28 APRIL 2006''',
the FlyMine Team from the University of Cambridge gave a
presentation about [http://www.flymine.org FlyMine] (more details below) at Imperial
College London, South Kensington campus.

* 3 pm: 20 minute talk followed by 25 minute demonstration with time for answering questions afterwards (Room 119, SAF building).
* 4 pm: 1 hour computer workshop (Room G28, SAF building).

The aim of the visit is to demonstrate how FlyMine can retrieve
information which is difficult or time consuming to get from other
resources, by introducing the key features of querying and navigating
through FlyMine. The workshop will provide hands-on practice.

The workshop is limited to a maximum number of 15 participants who already
have Imperial College login accounts.  Please sign-up by writing an email to
[[User:Maccallum|Bob MacCallum]] with the phrase "FlyMine workshop"
in the subject heading.

If you have any further questions, please contact [[User:Maccallum|Bob MacCallum]]




ABOUT FLYMINE
[http://www.flymine.org FlyMine] is an open source project developed
in the Department of Genetics at the University of Cambridge to build
an integrated database of genomic, expression and protein data for
Drosophila, Anopheles and other organisms. Such data sources are
available in a wide variety of formats in numerous different places,
making joint analysis of these data hard. As an integrated resource,
FlyMine makes it possible to run data mining queries that span these
domains of biological knowledge.

Data currently in FlyMine include genome annotation, microarray data,
protein interaction data, protein domains/families, predicted 3D
protein domain structures, transcription factor binding sites, GO
annotations and RNAi data. The inclusion of orthologues makes it
possible to run queries across organisms. For a full list of data
sources see http://www.flymine.org/sources

FlyMine is web-based, thus providing easy access with no need to
install any software. The interface provides facilities for browsing,
quick-access template queries and a query builder which allows users
to construct their own arbitrary queries.

FlyMine is funded by The Wellcome Trust.
