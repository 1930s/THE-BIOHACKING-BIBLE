==Minipreps to check ligations of J37015 and J37016==

The following parts were mini-preped: 
*L1, L2, L3, L4
*M1, M2, M3, M4
*R1, R2, R3, R4
*V1, V2, V3, V4
*Z1, Z3, Z4, Z5

Below is the one of the gels from the miniprep:
The bands run (from left to right)
*M1, M2, DNA ladder, R4, R3, R2, R1

Below is the second minprep gel containing (from left to right) : 
*Z5, Z4, Z3, Z1, DNA ladder, V4, V3, V2, V1, L4, L3, L2, L1

'''Problems'''

*Gels overran so no conclusive evidence could be obtained
*There were unexpected bands 
**This could be due to the fact that the cultures being minipreped were old
*Could not run M3, M4 since we had no more enzyme for the digest left

'''Actions'''

*Re-cultured the colonies which appear to have worked for re-minipreping these were
**'''J37015'''
***L 2,3,4
***M 1,2
**'''J37016'''
***V 2,3,4
***R 3,4

==Maxiprep of 2H==
successful

==Ligation==
*Ligation of 12D->2H and electroporated
*Cultured on LB Amp Plates and grown overnight

==Gene Clean & Electroporation==
*Cre 1, 2, 3, 4
*AiiA
*AiiA, Cre 1, 2, and 4 were electroporated, cultured on LB Amp plates and grown overnight
**Cre 3 sparked on electroporation, did not re-attempt since we already have three
