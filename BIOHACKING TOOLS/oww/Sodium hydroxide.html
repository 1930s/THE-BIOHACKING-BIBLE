===Sodium hydroxide===
* A strong base
* Stock solutions are 5 N and 1 N
* Molecular weight 40.00
* Exothermic reaction on solution
* Stock solutions should be stored in plastic bottles, rather than glass.
** Glass bottles are etched by strong bases over long periods of time.
* Stock solutions absorb carbon dioxide from the air, and gradually become neutralized.
**Check normality every year, or remake solutions.
* Very caustic, wear gloves during use.  Wash extensively if spilled.  A soap-like feel indicates that your skin has come in contact with the solution.
* Neutralize with acid prior to disposal down the drain.
