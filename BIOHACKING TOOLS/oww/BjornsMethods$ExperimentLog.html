*The first step of my adaptation protocol requires me to reproducibly grow bacteria to a concentration of '''5e7 - 2e8 cells/mL ''' in 1 hour

*Today I am taking one of my frozen aliquots of bacterial cells (BL21), thawing it, diluting it down to 2 different concentrations, and growing it back up to hopefully find out all the details of what initial concentration of cells will give me the desired concentration at the end of 1 hour.

*Going to try the following initial volumes of my frozen aliquot: 200uL, 500uL

#X uL of my Klett 80 (4e8 cells/mL) E. coli in ~9.9 mL LB solution in 125 mL flask
#Grow in orbital water bath at 37C, 200 rpm for 1 hr (or until back to Klett 80)
#Put flask on ice
#Serial dilute to get a 1e6 dilution of the Klett 80 solution and create 4 plates:  1x200uL, 2x100uL, 1x50uL 
#Grow overnight in warm room (37C)

Results:  
*After 1 hr, the 200uL sample was only at Klett 3 and the 500uL sample was at Klett 16.  I let the Klett 16 sample continue to grow for another hour at which it was at Klett 36.  At the end of one hour I still proceeded to plate and grow the 500uL sample to practice my technique.

#Remove my plates from the warm room
#Count colonies and calculate the true concentration of my Klett 16 solution


NOTE: I realized when I came in this morning that I diluted down my Klett 16 solutions as though they were of Klett 80, thus I had very few colonies on my plates this morning.  Live and learn ehh???


Today I'm going to repeat yesterday's protocol but with an initial bacteria aliquot volume of 1 mL and 1.5 mL since I was not able to get enough bacteria grown at yesterday's initial concentrations.


RESULTS: After 1 hr the 1 mL sample grew to Klett 18 and the 1.5 mL sample grew to Klett 35.  I diluted and plated them to grow overnight in the 37C room so I can count them in the morning.

Counted the colonies I grew yesterday and confirmed the following bacterial concentrations:

* 1.5 mL starting aliquot had 1.08e8 cells/mL
*1.0 mL starting aliquot had 7.5e7 cells/mL


These results now let us know how much of the initial cell aliquot to add to the LB solution so we have btw '''5e7 - 2e8 cells/mL ''' after 1 hour of growth.

Been working on my multi-agent systems simulator all weekend.  Its pretty cool ;)
