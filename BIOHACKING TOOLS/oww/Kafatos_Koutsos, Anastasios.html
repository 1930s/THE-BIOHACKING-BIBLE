Saddly, I am no longer a member of the [[kafatos:Kafatos/Christophides Lab|Kafatos/Christophides Lab]] at [http://www.imperial.ac.uk/ Imperial College], London. I stayed at the lab during my doctoral studies from October 2002 until May 2007. This page contains research interests and publication information concerning that period.<br>

== Research Interests ==
<blockquote>
My research interests were directed towards functional genomics in the mosquito, malaria vector, <i> Anopheles gambiae. </i>My work in the lab included the following :<br> 
*Functional characterisation of LRIM1 in <i>Anopheles gambiae.</i>
*Microarray transcriptomic analyses in the mosquito, malaria vector, <i>Anopheles gambiae.</i>
*The initial phase of building AnoEST, a database of expressed sequences of <i> Anopheles gambiae</i>
