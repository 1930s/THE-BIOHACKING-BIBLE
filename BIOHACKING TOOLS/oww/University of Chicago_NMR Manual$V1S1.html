NMRPipe is not your best choice of program for processing a 1D NMR spectrum. For most purposes, you are better off processing it at the console using VNMR. VNMR also features many tools for analyzing 1D spectra, such as T1 and T2 analysis, and versatile ways of displaying arrayed spectra. NMRPipe is more versatile than VNMR for multi-dimensional spectra. 

For the occasions when you do not have ready access to VNMR, follow the first steps in the procedure for processing a 2D spectrum with NMRPipe.

I have just become aware of a free OS X tool for processing 1D data. It’s called “transfourier” and was written by Stephen Jones of the College of Charleston, South Carolina. You can download it by going to: http://chem.cofc.edu/ssj/MacOSX/transfourier1-1.dmg.
