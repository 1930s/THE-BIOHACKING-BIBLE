==The Class==
The purpose of this class is to train students in the basic techniques of bacterial genetics. It consists of lectures on Mondays and Fridays and a three-hour lab on Wednesdays with a follow-up lab on Thursdays. The first half of the semester has a structured lab set-up to provide the students with the bacterial geneticist's toolbox. During the second half, the students are expected to take what they've learned and construct their own project, complete it, and present their data to the class. The structured lab activities are as follows:
