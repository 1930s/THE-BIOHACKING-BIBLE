I am currently working as a postdoctoral associate in the Departments of Materials Science and Engineering as well as Nuclear Science and Engineering at MIT. I am Austrian and received my PhD degree from Vienna (Austria) and Clausthal (Germany) Universities of Technology end of 2004. My research field is computational materials science where I am developing and applying simulation codes to predict the behavior of materials at the atomic scale. My expertise is in chemistry, physics, numerical mathematics and high-performance computing. I have filed a patent application related to semiconductor technology during my PhD thesis.
