OpenWetWare is a [[wiki]] created on April 20, 2005.  The mission of the site is "to support open research, education, publication, and discussion in biological sciences and engineering." 

OpenWetWare was founded by graduate students at [[MIT]].  Initially, OpenWetWare served as a private lab wiki for the labs of [[Drew Endy]] and [[Tom Knight]] at [[MIT]].  The site was opened up to allow any lab to join on June 22, 2005.  As of August 21, 2006 the site hosted [http://openwetware.org/index.php?title=Labs&oldid=63186 50 research laboratories] from [http://openwetware.org/index.php?title=Labs&oldid=63186  30 institutions], including [[Boston University]] [[Brown University]],[[Caltech]],[[Cambridge Research Institute]],[[CNRS]],[[Harvard University]], and [http://openwetware.org/index.php?title=Labs&oldid=63186 many others].

In addition to laboratories, a number of scientific communities are based on the site, including [[Synthetic Biology|synthetic biology]], ([http://openwetware.org/wiki/Synthetic_Biology home]), [[Mimulus]] ([http://openwetware.org/wiki/Mimulus_Community home]), and the [[BioBricks Foundation]] ([http://openwetware.org/wiki/The_BioBricks_Foundation home]).
