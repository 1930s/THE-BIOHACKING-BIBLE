[[Image:Victor3platereadermediabackground.jpg|thumb|700px|left|'''Plot of media fluorescence (measured using GFP filters) versus time''']]
This plot shows the background fluorescence of [[Neidhardt EZ Rich Defined | EZ rich media]] from Teknova + 0.4% glycerol + antibiotic over time.  This is data from two separate runs done on different days (circles and squares).  Each run is an average of 3 replicates.

This experiment was done on the Endy lab Victor3 plate reader using 96 well plates from the Endy lab but using media and antibiotic from the [[Knight Lab]].  Water was injected into the wells over the course of the experiment to counteract evaporation, according to [[Endy:Victor3 counteracting evaporation in long time courses | this protocol]].

The reason for the lower background of EZ rich media + streptomycin for one of the days is unknown.

This plot is intended to demonstrate fluctuation in background (media-only) fluorescence measurements over time.  This data is '''very preliminary''' and has not been independently verified.  Use at your own risk!
