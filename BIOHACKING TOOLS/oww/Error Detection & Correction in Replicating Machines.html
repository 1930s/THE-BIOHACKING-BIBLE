==Replication with Error Working Group==

===Introduction===
Biological systems are replicating machines that make (a small number of) errors during the machine replication process.  From a practical engineering standpoint, we need to understand how to design biological systems that perform as expected.  We can imagine that a future biological engineer might be called upon to design an 8-bit counter that has a p(working) > 0.99 upto 256 doubling events.  Or, we can imagine needing to design a metabolic pathway that has a p(failure) > 0.99 after 3000 doubling events.  And so on.  In other words, the evolutionary stability, or lack thereof, for our engineering biological systems should become part of the initial system specification, and our designs should be able to meet these specifications.  From a scientific perspective, we suspect that learning how to solve questions of error detection and correction in replicating machines will lead to a better understanding of biological evolution.
