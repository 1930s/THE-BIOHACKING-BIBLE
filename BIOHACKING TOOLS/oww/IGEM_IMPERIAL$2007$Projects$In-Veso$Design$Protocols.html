====Procedure====


# The cell extracts were prepared from E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI). 
# Grow cells at 37 °C in 3 L of 2xYT medium with vigorous agitation and aeration till OD600=0.6.
# Add isopropyl-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, 1 mM) to the cell culture media to express T7 RNA polymerase. 
# Harvest cells in the mid-log phase (OD600 ≈ 4.5). 
# Wash three times by suspending them in 20 mL of buffer A per gram of wet cells. 
# Centrifuge.
# Before storing the pellets at −80 °C, weigh the wet cell pellets.
# Suspend thawed cells (10 g) in 12.7 mL of buffer B.
# Disrupt cells in a French press cell (Aminco) at a constant pressure of 20,000 psi.
# Store the pellets at −80 °C. 
# Centrifuge the lysate at 30,000 RCF for 30 min at 4 °C.
# Carefully removed the top layer of the supernatant (lipid layer) and pellet, and centrifuge them again.
# Shake the final supernatant at 100 rpm.
# Gradually add 3 mL of the pre-incubation solution to 10 mL of the supernatant.
# Incubate supernatant with gentle shaking at 37 °C for 80 min. 
# Dialyze x 4 the pre-incubated sample for 45 min each at 4 °C against 50 volumes of buffer B using a Pierce membrane (SnakeSkin™ Pleated Dialysis Tubing, Rockford, USA) with a molecular weight cut off (MWCO) of 10,000
# The retained extract was centrifuged at 4000 RCF for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain the supernatant (the S30 extract).

====Notes====
* S12 cost approximately 50% less than S30.
* S12 shows less batch to batch variation.
* S12 has a substantially higher amount of translational activity than the S30 extract in the Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen)and BL21-Star strains.
* The only exception is that S12 extract for A19 E.coli strain shows much less activity.
* S12 provides approximately 1.5 times higher productivity. 
* S12 extract can be prepared with 20% of the cost required for the preparation of the S30 extract
* Preparation time for the S12 extract is only 40% of that required for the S30 extract.

===Empty Vesicle Preparation by the Mineral Oil Method===
The protocol is based on [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=12963816 Engineering Asymmetric Vesicles] by Sophie Pautot, Barbara J. Frisken, and D. A. Weitz.

====Materials====
=====Equipment=====
* Sonicator with medium-sized probe (??)
* Nitrogen tap
* Desiccator connected to a vacuum
* 25°C incubator
* Magnetic stirrer
* 120 x g centrifuge (1-inch tubes)
* 200µl pipette
* 1000µl pipette
* 50ml glass tube
* 100ml glass bottle

=====Chemicals and reagents=====
* 10ml dodecane
* 12.5µl 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) 20mg/ml in chloroform, ≥99.0%
* 10ml ddH2O
* Tris buffer
* NaCl
* Cell extract (Determine quantity)

=====Supplies=====
* 1-inch diameter glass centrifuge tube
* 5-ml syringe
* long 16-gauge stainless steel needle
* Ice bath
* 1ml pipette tip
* Plastic tubing

====Procedure====

'''Preparing the lipid-oil suspension for the inner leaflet:'''

# Place 125 µl of the 20 mg/ml DOPC solution in a 100-ml glass bottle
# With the plastic tubing and 1ml pipette tip, evaporate the chloroform under nitrogen to obtain a dry, thin lipid film.
# Put the bottle in a desiccator connected to a vacuum for 1hr
# Add 50 ml of mineral oil to reach a final lipid concentration of 0.05 mg/ml
# Set the sonicator probe to pulse 1, timer at 30mins
# Put the bottle containing the suspension in the ice bath
# Secure the sonicator probe inside the bottle, and set the amplitude to a reading of 10 when it is sonicating
# Sonicate the suspension for 30mins
# Leave overnight at 25°C to ensure that the lipid molecules are fully dispersed in oil

'''Emulsifying the acqueous solution:''' (while the interface settles)

# Separate about 5 ml of the lipid-oil suspension into a glass container (for the interface preparation)
# Prepare a 10ml solution A with 100 mM NaCl and 5 mM Tris buffer at pH 7.4
# Prepare solution B by ADDING REPORTER (Determine quantity) to 1ml of solution A.
# Add 250 µl of solution B to the 45ml lipid-oil suspension in mineral oil
# Gently stir the mixture with a magnetic stir bar for 3 hours

'''Preparing the interface:''' (to be done while the emulsion is mixed)

# Place 2 ml of lipid-oil suspension over 3 ml of solution A in a 1-inch-diameter centrifuge tube. 
# Leave for 2–3 h for lipids to achieve the coverage of the interface surface

'''Forming the vesicles:'''

# Pour 100 µl of the inverted emulsion over the interface 
# Centrifuge at 120 x g for 10 min

'''Collecting the vesicles:'''

# Using a 5-ml syringe with a long 16-gauge stainless steel needle, collect some of solution A
# Expel some of the solution to remove all air from the syringe and needle
# With the tip of the needle in the aqueous phase, gently expel the solution contained in the syringe 
# Gently recirculate the buffer several times
# Aspirate most of the solution into the syringe, and remove the needle from the solution
# Wipe the tip of the needle clean 
# Unload the vesicle suspension into its final container

Use optical microscopy to check that the vesicles obtained were not deformed or aggregated.

=====Time Required=====
* The lipid-oil suspension preparation takes about 2 hours, before being left overnight (with a 1hr waiting period 15min into the procedure).
* The remainder of the procedure takes another 4 hours, with one 2hr waiting period after an initial 1hr preparation.
* Total working time in the lab is around 3 hours.

====Notes====
* The original protocol uses anhydrous 99:1 dodecane:silicone oil solution instead of mineral oil
* The original protocol uses POPC instead of DOPC phospholipids
* The original protocol sonicates the suspension in a cleaning sonic bath for 30 min
* Do not use rubber tubing in the nitrogen evaporation - these emit debris into the lipids
* This procedure should form around 10^9 vesicles with 1µm diameter
* Use of salt in the solution A preparation may require osmolarity considerations
* The reporter in solution B is optional - the vesiles may be visible without it
* Use of GFP as a visual signal may require osmolarity considerations
* The interface should settle for more than 2 hours, but less than 3 - more than three and the lipids begin to clump.
