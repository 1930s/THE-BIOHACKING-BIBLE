==Materials==
destaining solution- Methanol:acetic acid: water (45:5:45)<br>
sensitizing agent 0.02% sodium thiosulfate- 0.1g Na2S2O3 per 500ml water<br>
0.1% silver solution- 0.1g in 100ml water<br>
Developing solution- 150µl 37% formalin solution, 12.5g Na2Co3, 500ml water<br>
Quench solution- 5ml acetic acid in 500ml water<br>
<br>

==Methods==
#Fix gel with destaining solution for 20-30 minutes<br>
#Rinse gel with water for 20-60 min to remove acid<br>
#Sensitize gel with 0.02% sodium thiosulfate for 1-2 min<br>
#discard solution and rinse gel with two changes of water (1 minute each)<br>
#incubate gel in chilled 0.1% silver solution for 20-40 minutes at RT<br>
#discard solution and rinse gel with two changes of water (1 minute each)<br>
#Develop gel with Developing solution with shaking (replace developing solution when it turns yellow)<br>
#Quench when sufficient staining is obtained by discarding developing solution and adding quench solution<br>
#store in 1% acetic acid at 4°C or dry gel<br>

==Notes==
#don't touch gel with bare fingers, wash latex gloves before handing gels, use dishes that are only for silverstaining
#pressure by forceps on the gel can leave marks that will be seen by the silver stain
#you can silver stain and then coomassie stain the gel, I don't know if you can do the reverse
#this method should allow you to mass spec proteins from the gel after silverstaining
#overloading of protein on the gel can result in bands that are brown on the outside and white in the middle
#for highest sensitivity rinse for 60 minutes, or more, after the gel has been run and fixed, this helps to keep the background transparent during development
#do not use glutaraldehyde as the sensitizing agent- it is also a protein crosslinking agent
