==Western Blot Images==
Today we applied both antibody washes and imaged our GFP Western blot.  These are the resulting images:

==Innoculation of transformation products from yesterday==

Only the:
*4500\xp a\xp
*0034\sp a\xp
*0034\sp c\xp
*4500\xp c\xp
*4500\sp b\xp
*+ cont.

Grew! innoculated 2 clones/ea, except for 0034\sp c\xp. In 4uL with CARB antibiotic. --[[User:Zsun|Zsun]] 20:53, 19 August 2006 (EDT)


==Digest of J04500\xp J04500 \sp KaiABC \xp B0034\sp==
Redigested two of each of the above per. silver protocol ratios, except each enzyme was diluted 3fold. (in other words, each sample had 7.2 uL DNA), 16h @ 45C. The J04500 source was again the 97ng/uL.
