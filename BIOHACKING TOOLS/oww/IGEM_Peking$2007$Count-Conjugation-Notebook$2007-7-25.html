==oriT Knock Out==
*By Xu Anting
*Successfully ligated up- and downstream fragments of 600 bp to 1200 bp using overlapped PCR, but agarose gel also showed that there are unspecific bands (750 bp) in PCR products.  Therefore I chose gel separation to get purified products.
*Use BamHI and SalI to digest the fragment in 37 centigrade, overnight.
*Ready to ligate fragments to pUC18 and have them transformed and sequenced.

==Conjugation Test==
*By Liu Ting
*pSC101 competent cells are ready.  I transformed pUC18 to test their efficiency and will get the result tomorrow.
*failed to purify the pSC101 plasmid (~9 kb) from E. coli.  Will try again tomorrow.

=Key & Lock by Yu Tao and Zheng Qinsi=
==R0040<-crRNA==
*Ligation transformants do not grow.
*Re-ligation tonight, and overnight, plan to ligate under 16℃ tomorrow morning.
*In case it is the XbaI/PstI digestion of the PCR product ends that failed. We will rePCR tonight, see below.

===Transformation result of R0040<-J23078===
*There are no colonies in the experimental plate and the negative control plate but thousands of colonies in the positive control plate.
*I think it is because of the inefficiency of the double digestion of J23078, though I can not rule other possibilities out.
*I suggest do the double digestion, purification, ligation and transformation once more.

==Double Digesting R0010 and J23066==
*Digesting R0010 with SpeI/PstI and J23066 with PstI/XbaI. 
*Digestion system contains:

<pre>
0.5 µl     EcoRI
0.5 µl     PstI
10 µl      Plasmid
2 µl       10*H
8 µl       ddH20
--------------------------
20 µl      Total
</pre>

*Treat each plasmid with two 20uL systems(So totally 40uL system per plasmid). 
*37℃ culutre for 8 hours.

==R0010, J23066 Digestion Product purification==
*use Transgen EasyPure PCR Purification Kit / Quick Gel Extraction Kit.
*30uL after purflication, respectively
