Maximilian Haeussler, I'm a PhD student in Bioinformatics, working in the biology lab of [http://www.cnrs-gif.fr/iaf/eng/depsn/index.html Jean-Stephane Joly] in Gif-sur-Yvette in Paris/France. We're doing evo-devo here on the model species [http://www.marlin.ac.uk/species/Cionaintestinalis.htm ciona intestinalis]. I'm trying to find some binding sites with computer programs, so far, with very limited success.

I have written my own version of matrix search, hit display on multiple alignments and matrix-combination search and I'm happy to share these with anyone interested.
