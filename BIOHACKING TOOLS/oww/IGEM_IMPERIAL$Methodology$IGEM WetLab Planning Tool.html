==Why an iGEM planning tool ?==
*During summer 2006, iGEM-Wetlab@imperial was a real mess (some parts were lost, some experiments were useless).
*Time was lost due to poor stock management or labeling problems.
*Most of the iGEM participants come to the competition without an extensive wetlab experience. Real need for guidelines and good practices.
*Due to the standardization and modularity of the BioBricks there is room for a systematic approach to deal with the work flow of the wetLab.

==Suggested concepts for an iGEM planning tool==

*BioBricks are the fundamental material:
**An iGEM project could be fully described from a BioBrick perspective (creation, wetlab manipulation, assembly, characterization ...)
**Biobricks can have different status, in regards to their wetlab manipulations:
***Dry DNA from Registry plates
***Transformed into a given cell strain
***Mini/Maxi-preped
***Digested
***Ligated
***Sequenced
***Characterized
***....
*Wetlab Protocols are transformations applied to the BioBrick status (updating their status).
**they can be viewed as being some sort of transfer functions:
***Inputs: BioBrick(s) (with a defined status), Consumables, Equipments, Operator(s).
***Ouputs: BioBrick(s) with new status, Data, Report.
***The transfer function corresponds to the standard list of wetlab manipulations of a given protocol.
****it could be interesting to use Gantt Charts to represent protocols (it gives a feel for timing and concurrent actions).
**A Biobrick wetlab flow can then be described by the assembly of these protocol 'transfer functions'
**Due to constrains on the status of the BioBrick as Inputs/Outputs, it will be easy for student to check consistency of their BioBrick wetlab flow.

*Having such a defined framework will allow a systematic labeling strategy:
**ID associated to BioBrick, Protocol, Operator(s), Date.
*Should be easier to defined a quality control strategy.


==To do list:==
*List all possible status for a BioBrick. <font color=green> work in progress </font>
*Define a wetlab workflow scenario with all the protocols involved (e.g. ligating 2 parts from Registry DNA plates)<font color=red> to be done </font>
*Define the interface of each protocol (inputs/ouputs)<font color=red> to be done </font>
*Represent the workflow. <font color=red> to be done </font>
*Define a labeling strategy according to workflow. <font color=red> to be done </font>
*Define a lab notebook strategy to track the workflow. <font color=red> to be done </font>
