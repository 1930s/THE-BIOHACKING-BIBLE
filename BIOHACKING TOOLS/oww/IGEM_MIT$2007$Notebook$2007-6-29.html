===Agenda for Friday, June 29===
*Morning
**pBAD pickup
**Is OmpA crucial to bacterial cell survival?
**Finalize oligos (restriction sites)
**Research "red team" stuff -- ion exchange
**Brian -- stainless steel, nylon binding?
**Check on FhuA and pSB3K3 colonies

*Afternoon
**Look for metal inducible promoters (Mer) to fuse to GFP/something FP/whatever
**Order above oligo
**Find/finalize vector (pBAD33?)
**Have everything ordered by the end of today!!

*Question to think about: metal ion diffusion into the cell or binding at the surface?

==pSB3K3==
*9AM - Good news, all of the colonies we picked last night are cloudy today! :D
