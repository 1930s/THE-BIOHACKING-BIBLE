*make a flyer about 1 month in advance
*set up text for website (modify last years if lazy)
*send out email to Scripps list (through SoF president) announcing the party in which you ask for people to send you the number of tickets they want, their names, their email (for confirmation) and a check by internal mail (or have them come by if you can be bothered)
*compile list of participants who have paid (use [http://www.google.com/google-d-s/b1.html Google Spreadsheet] if you have help)
*decorate the boat on the day of event
