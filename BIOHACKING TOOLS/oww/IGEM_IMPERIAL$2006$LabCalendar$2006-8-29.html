 <u>'''TO DO:'''</u>
 
 *Culture up the ligated parts (J37022 & J37025) for miniprep (to check whether ligations from Monday 
  were successful) from plates in incubator 
 *Make frozen stock of 4G(S01656), J37018 and colony 2 of J37020
 *Make more 50 times TAE
 *Culture for testing: T9002, J37015, J37020 (colony 2)
 *To order: LB medium (or make up ourselves & send to autoclave) & make some LB Amp to have in stock 
            Autoclaved flasks (and cuvettes?)
            Need more eppendorfs
            More LB Amp plates ? (How many more do we need for our remaining time - there are about 10 left)
 *Gels from the weekend need to be analysed: Were J37018 & J37024 ligations successful ?

==LoxP PCR==

*Run once more, this time with DMSO, and a larger amount of maxiprepped DNA
*Major breakthrough - discovered that the reason for the repeated failures maybe that the DNA is there, but is not showing up.
*Today's gel was looked at immediately after being run and two distinct bands could be seen - however these disappeared once left for a few minutes.
*Once immersed in Ethidium bromide solution, the bands reappeared under the UV light.

==Ligations== 
*Repeat ligation J37023(Immunotagged AiiA)->1I 
**Digest DNA from Maxi prep stock
**Run Maxi prep gel
**[[Image:Maxi_j37024.pdf]]
**Glass Milk Purify insert and vector (J37023 and 1I respectively)
**Leave to ligate overnight

==Testing==
Culture Up bacteria for testing tomorrow.
