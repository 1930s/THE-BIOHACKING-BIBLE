I'm currently a junior in Nuclear Science and Engineering, intending to continue on to graduate school to receive my doctorate. I've been interested in energy and environmental issues, particularly the current oil crisis, ever since I was very young. I see nuclear fusion as one possible way to help resolve this problem, and plan to conduct fusion research after I graduate. I love to educate people (hopefully taking away their misconceptions) about nuclear energy sources, energy sources, and how their actions affect this beautiful planet; I hope to write children's books and simple easy-to-read books as well for the general public to address these issues. I'm also a Pledge Ambassador!
