There are probably hundreds of GO tools. I don't know many. Have a look at [http://www.geneontology.org/ the Genontology Website for a better overview.]  

[http://crfb.univ-mrs.fr/GOToolBox/index.php gostattoolbox] most accessed article of genome biology, used by a [http://genomebiology.com.gate1.inist.fr/2006/7/6/319 recent paper]

[ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA/ NCBI Entrez Genes GO data] in an easy tab-delimited format for simple loading into script-languages (mentioned by alexander morgan on the biopython list)

there is a similar thing for plants somewhere on tigr.org.

[http://wego.genomics.org.cn/cgi-bin/wego/index.pl Wego:] Upload your gene lists and see which category or sub-category is over-represented. The page has a good linklist for GO and graphics-tools.

[http://gostat.wehi.edu.au/ Gostat:] Seems to be the same thing as Wego...?

[[http://www.charite.de/ch/medgen/ontologizer/ The Ontologizer] can apprently better cope with the complex parent-child distributions of GO

[[http://func.eva.mpg.de/ FUNC]] claims to be better in its statistical approach than Gostat, is a lot more recent and, est of all, available as a standalone PERL-Program. In addition, it's author is very helpful.
