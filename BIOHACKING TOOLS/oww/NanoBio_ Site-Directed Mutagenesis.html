== Site-Directed Mutagenesis ==
* Use QuikChange's Mult-Site Directed Mutagenesis Kit to do site-directed mutagenesis, even if only one site is to be mutated.
* Design and order PAGE-purified primer(s). [http://www.stratagene.com/QPCR/tmCalc.aspx Stratagene's website] has a nice interface to help you design primers. Briefly, your primers must:
** be between 25-45 bp long
** have the site to be mutated approximately in the middle of the primer, with 10-15 bp flanking this site
** have a melting temperature greater or equal to 75C
** have a GC content of at least 40%
** (only if using multiple primers): all bind to the same template strand
* See the [http://www.stratagene.com/manuals/200518.pdf instruction manual] for additional details.
* When doing the site-directed mutagenesis, follow the instructions in the manual, with these changes:
**Do two pcr reactions: one with 1.0 uL of template DNA, and a second with 0.5 uL template DNA.
**Digest with DpnI for at least 5 hrs., or preferably overnight, rather than for 1 hour.
**XL-10 Gold Cells can be transformed in eppendorf tubes using SOC media, rather than in Falcon tubes with NZY+ media.
**After adding the DpnI-digested pcr reaction to the XL-10 Gold cells, incubate on ice for 45 min - 1hr, instead of 30 min.
**From 500 uL of SOC + transformants, plate 50uL. Centrifuge the remaining cells and media. Leaving the pelleted cells intact, remove all but ~150 uL of media. Re-suspend the cells, then spread them on a second plate. Essentially, you are plating all the cells from remaining 450 uL transformation mixture, but just decreasing the volume that you are spreading on the plate to ~150 uL.
* In our experience, this procedure works well. There are [http://openwetware.org/wiki/Site-directed_mutagenesis other protocols] around if you run into problems.
