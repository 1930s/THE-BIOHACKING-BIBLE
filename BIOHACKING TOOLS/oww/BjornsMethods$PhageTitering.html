== Phage Titering ==
Goal: want to know approximately how many phage are within a given solution volume (ex:  # phage/mL)

===Phage serial dilutions===
* Have your phage lysate (~1e10 or 1e11 phage/mL) in fridge already
* Get 5 test tubes out
* Label tubes:  (1) 1e2, (2) 1e4, (3) 1e6; (4) 1e7, (5) 1e8
* fill tubes 1-3 with 9.9mL LB solution 
* fill tubes 4-5 with 9 mL LB solution

* add 100 microL phage lysate to tube 1 and mix well
* add 100 microL tube 1 into tube 2 and mix well
* add 100 microL tube 2 into tube 3 and mix well
* add 1 mL tube 3 into tube 4 and mix well
* add 1 mL tube 4 into tube 5 and mix well


*NOTE: We only are going to use dilutions 4 & 5.  Dilutions 1-3 were only created to get to 4 & 5.

===Soft agar prep=== 
* get 8 small test tubes with metal caps and put into heating block @55C
* put 2.5 mL of liquid soft agar (found in 55C incubator) into each tube and continue heating in block

===Soft agar container prep===
* get out 8 - 1.7 mL eppendorf tubes and label 1-4 with 1e7; 5-8 with 10e8... 1-2 & 5-6 with 50 microL and 3-4 & 6-7 with 100 microL
* get out 8 petri dishes and label them the same as each eppendorf tube marking along a 1 or 2 denoting duplicate number

===Phage infection of bacteria in soft agar===
Ultimately we want to create a plate full of bacteria and mix in a known volume of diluted phage solution to let the phage infect the bacteria and create a discrete number of plaques that can be visualize and counted to determine the actual number of phage that was in a particular volume of phage solution.  This is a 


* put 250 microL overnight bacteria stock into each eppendorf tube
* put 50 or 100 microL phage dilutions into each eppendorf tube for the appropriately labeled tube
* put entire mixed eppendorf tube contents into soft agar tube
* pour soft agar tube immediately into petri dish 
* place petri dishes in 37C room and flip dishes when agar hardens

===Counting phage plaques===
After overnight growth, visual plaques should be apparent and can be hand counted.  Thus, we can calculate the true value of phage concentration by:  (# plaques)/(X microL solution)  <-- Depends on volume of phage solution added (50 or 100)
