It is very easy to do this mount ''once you know how''.

1. Create the directory which you want to be equivalent to the root directory of the mounted filesystem. On my machine I do this with
  sudo mkdir /mnt/mcb

2. Now you are ready to mount the server. After issuing the following command you will be prompted for your MCB password
  sudo mount -t smbfs -o username=friedm,workgroup=mcb,uid=baf //lsdivfs3.mcb.harvard.edu/Maniatis_Lab /mnt/mcb

Here <code>friedm</code> is my username ''on the MCB server'' and <code>baf</code> is my username ''on my linux box''. If you don't 
supply <code>username</code> then it won't be able to make the connection. If you don't supply <code>uid</code> then all the mounted files
will default to be owned by <code>root</code> on your local filesystem. In that case you will have no trouble reading them, but you will
need to use <code>sudo</code> to make any changes or write new files.

The document on Mac and PC mounting says that some labs have truncations in their names, so if you have a PI with a long last name try some variants. If you can't figure out the correct directory, just connect using the PC or Mac instructions on a PC or Mac (available at [http://internal.mcb.harvard.edu/Tech/CompServices/HelpFiles/pdfs/ConnectToCelerra.pdf MCB internal website]) and scroll down the list of available directories.
