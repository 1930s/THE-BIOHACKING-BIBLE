==To-do==
# <s>Make frozen stocks of the KaiA+bkb and KaiB+bkb transformants that we grew up in liquid culture yesterday</s>
# <s>Miniprep the above</s>
# <s>(Maybe) Do an X-P digest of the KaiA+bkb and KaiB+bkb plasmids (though we may want to wait and do this along with the other KaiA+bkb and KaiB+bkb ligation transformants) '''(Will do later)'''</s> completed 8/7/06
# <s>Inoculate the KaiA+bkb and KaiB+bkb transformants from yesterday's ligation</s>
# <s>Add CIP to the E-S digest of LC vector</s>
# <s>Run the digests from yesterday on a gel (E-S digest of LC vector, X-P digest of J04450+bkb)</s>
# <s>Gel-extract</s> and purify the LC vector and J04450 insert if they exist '''(Will purify tomorrow, along with the high-copy backbone that the J04450 was inserted in)'''
# <s>(maybe) Perform a ligation and transformation of the J04450 insert into LC vector '''(Will do after we gel-purify them)'''</s> completed 8/7/06
# <s>Do 12 minipreps for Mingming</s>
# <s> Check sequencing on the Genewiz website </s> (the orders have not been processed)

==KaiA/B + bkb inoculation==
We found 10 colonies on the KaiA+bkb plate and 5 colonies on the KaiB+bkb plate. We inoculated all 15 colonies in liquid culture (8 mL LB, 8 uL Amp) and placed them in the 37C shaker around 1830.

We extracted the high-copy vector (2kb) and J04450 insert (1kb) from lanes 2 and 4, and the low-copy vector (3.5 kb) from lanes 6 and 8.
