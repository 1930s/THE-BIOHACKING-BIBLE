We have PCR'd the Hin gene as well as both orientations of the antibiotic genes. We have been having trouble getting to the ligation phase because our digested plasmid yield is low. Our hope is that with some new equipment we will be able to ligate and transform the cells by the end of the week. We also plan to ligate the double terminator [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_B0015| BBa_B0015 DNA-1 1I] upstream of the recombinational enhancer. Before we are able to proceed with the ligation of RE and the double terminator we need to have RE and Hix C sequenced again to ensure that they do not contain any mutations.
