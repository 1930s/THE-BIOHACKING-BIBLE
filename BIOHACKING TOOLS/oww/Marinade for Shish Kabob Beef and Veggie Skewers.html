The following measurements are approximate:

*1/3C soy sauce
*1/3C vegetable oil
*Splash of vinegar (maybe 1-2t)
*2 cloves garlic, chopped
*1T ketchup
*1t dried minced onions
*1/2t ground pepper

A few comments:

*Use low sodium soy sauce if possible
*Use less oil for chicken
*Finely chopped, fresh onions can be subsituted for the dried onions (dried onions provided stonger flavor)
