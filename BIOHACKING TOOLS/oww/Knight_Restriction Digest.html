*Restriction enzymes ([http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/productR0101.asp EcoR I], [http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/productR0133.asp Spe I], [http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/productR0145.asp Xba I] or [http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/productR0140.asp Pst I]) from [http://www.neb.com/ NEB]
*EcoR I buffer
*BSA
*Deionized, sterile H<sub>2</sub>O

==Digest Mix==

''Example - 50 &mu;L reaction.  100 &mu;L reactions are also common especially if your DNA to be cut is dilute.''

*5 &mu;L NEB2 buffer (for all digests with BioBricks enzymes, we use NEB2 buffer.  It keeps things simple and seems to work).
*X &mu;L DNA (usually ~500 ng depending on downstream uses).
*0.5 &mu;L 100X BSA (added to all digests because BSA never hurts a restriction digest)
*1 &mu;L BioBricks enzyme 1 (regardless of the volume of the reaction, 1 &mu;L enzyme is used because generally this represents a 10-25 fold excess of enzyme and is therefore sufficient for most digests.  Also, it can be difficult to accurately pipet less than 1 &mu;L of enzyme since it is sticky due to the glycerol content.)
*1 &mu;L BioBricks enzyme 2
*(42.5 - X) &mu;L deionized, sterile H<sub>2</sub>O

==Procedure==

#Add appropriate amount of deionized H<sub>2</sub>O to sterile 0.6 mL tube
#Add restriction enzyme buffer to the tube.  <br>Vortex buffer before pipetting to ensure that it is well-mixed.
#Add BSA to the tube.  <br>Vortex BSA before pipetting to ensure that it is well-mixed.
#Add appropriate amount of DNA to be cut to the tube. <br>Vortex DNA before pipetting to ensure that it is well-mixed.
#Add 1 &mu;L of each enzyme. <br>Vortex enzyme before pipetting to ensure that it is well-mixed.  <br>Also, the enzyme is in some percentage of glycerol which tends to stick to the sides of your tip.  To ensure you add only 1 &mu;L, just touch your tip to the surface of the liquid when pipetting.
#Place in thermal cycler ([http://www.mjr.com/ MJ Research], PT-200) and run digest protocol.
##4-6 hour incubation at 37&deg;C <br> Use a longer incubation time if you have time or are worried about the efficiency of cutting.  I think this time can be shortened to 2 hrs while still cutting to completion.
##20 mins at 80&deg;C to heat inactivate enzyme.<br> This step is sufficient to inactivate even Pst I.
##4&deg;C forever (or until you pull the reaction out of the thermal cycler).
#Generally, use some method of [[Purification of DNA | DNA purification]] to eliminate enzymes and salt from the reaction.
