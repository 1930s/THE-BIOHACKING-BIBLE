==Sosnick Lab Orders page==

This is a dynamic page meant to keep track of stuff that ought to get ordered, but might not be worth ordering by itself.  If you want to order something, include the following:

*Name of item
*Approximate quantity of item needed
*Most likely place(s) to get item
*Timeframe of order

Once an order is placed, please mark it as so with a signature and timestamp.  Delete old orders once they become irrelevant (i.e. show up).

===Example===
Order:
* Pipet tips, 1000 uL
* A case (roughly 10 packs of 1000 tips)
* Fisher
* In the next 1-2 weeks

Ordered these, along with xtra gloves.  [[User:Ecukier|Ecukier]] 16:28, 22 December 2005 (EST)

Note that this page is no substitute for doing it yourself.
