* different ways to decompose depending on the goal
** example: mechanical system (support structure) (power transfer)
* Structural composition
* Functional composition


Interfaces and standards
* standard methods of connecting one part to another
** screws
** lego blocks
** electrical wiring
** plumbing


Hierarchical abstraction
* Black boxes
* interfaces between boxes


Decorative components


Connectors


Flexibility
