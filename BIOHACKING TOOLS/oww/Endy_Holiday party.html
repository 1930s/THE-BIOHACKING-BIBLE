==What==
'''This section is open for discussion about the format of the party.  Ideas that have been proposed include renting out a bar for a celebration with the Silver/Sauer/TK lab, dinner out, a gathering at someone's house, etc.  Please provide more specific suggestions and comments below.'''
*It would be fun to include others in the festivities. I felt like last year's party was a bit stiff, so maybe it would be fun to have it at a bar this year. Liven things up a bit. No thong song, either (no offense, Leon!). (Samantha)
*What about at King's Bowling Alley? I hear it is really trendy and fun... the same words I'd use to describe the Endy lab! (Samantha)
*Also, [http://www.jilliansboston.com/ Jillian's] is kinda cool (just been renovated about a year ago) with [http://www.luckystrikeboston.com/ 16 bowling lanes] and 80’ by 10’ video wall. They have rooms for [http://luckystrikeboston.com/functions/ private parties] too. --[[User:Ilya|Ilya]]
