  # Description: A script to generate 10,000 strings of 10 random
  # coinflips (H or T) and outputs the tally of contiguous (overlapping
  # stretches of 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, and 10 H's or T's in that set of
  # 10,000 10-mers

  # figure out how many overlapping stretches of H's there are. will do
  # this for each string for each substring. in other words will find
  # all instances of 'HH' in each of the strings, and then all instances
  # of 'HHH' in each of the strings etc.

  	  # instances of the substring just set (overlapping)
