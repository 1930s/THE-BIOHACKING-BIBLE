==8/21==

After last week's success, we  have much to do! See the plans page for more details. For today:

*Design strand displacement oligos

Done: Complementary to T20's 5bp linker + 15 bp complementary region; additionally, the complementary oligo of T20 in case a 5bp foothold is not sufficient. Sequences found in oligos page.

*Test bead density assay (fun)

Another magnetic particle migration assay was carried out. Double stranded oligos with biotinylated ends were added to a solution of magnetic and agarose streptavidin beads, which were compared with simply adding magnetic and agarose streptavidin beads when a magnet was applied. The results are shown below.

The negative control is shown on the right. Particles move more quickly towards the magnet in the sample with biotinylated oligos, but fall faster in the second case. More to come.

*Design new adaptamers that bind cell surface

*Design new adaptamers that vary interaction

I was too optimistic in the time it would take to develop these. See the entries from the following days.
