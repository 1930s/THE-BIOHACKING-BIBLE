== Academic & Research Interests ==
My academic and research interests lie in integrating molecular biology and biochemistry with engineering techniques for a broad-range of clinical applications. Specifically, I am interested in metabolic engineering, computational systems biology and bioinformatics, analytical proteomics and metabolomics, bioprocess and biochemical engineering, tissue engineering, and protein purification.

Aside from true research interests, there are a few other fields which I try to keep up with in popular science: theoretical physics, computational biophysics, evolutionary biology and biomacromolecular evolution, philosophy of molecular biology, biomedical ethics, and more recently alternative fuel technology.

== Personal ==
I graduated with a B.S. in chemical engineering and a minor in philosophy from Tufts University in May of 2007. Starting the fall of 2007, I will be pursuing a M.S. degree in chemical engineering in our department. Although I've been told my accent is almost gone (that's scary), I grew up in a suburb of Boston: Bedford, MA and attended Bedford High School. I enjoy hanging out with my friends, watching movies ([http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/ ''The Godfather''] and [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086250/ ''Scarface''], in particular), watching the [http://www.patriots.com/ Patriots] and [http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/index.jsp?c_id=bos Red Sox], listening to music (thatâ€™s right, Academy Award Winners [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_6_Mafia Three 6 Mafia]), and playing sports (tennis, golf, ping-pong, whiffleball (if that's a sport), baseball, and basketball).
