Calcium imaging is a technique used to determine location of calcium in a cell. Since calcium is used in a variety of integral cellular processes, the ability to visualize it in the cell provides scientists with a powerful research tool. In order for the calcium to visualized, fluorescent protein/dyes that form complexes with calcium are usually used. When these fluorescent molecules bind to calcium, they fluoresce at a certain wavelength that can then be visualized through a fluorescent microscope (floscope). esce at a certain wavelength that can then be visualized through a flourescent microcsope (floscope).
