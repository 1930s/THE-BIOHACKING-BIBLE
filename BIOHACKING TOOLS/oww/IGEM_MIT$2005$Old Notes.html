==What to be used==
:-Promoter X: 
::pBAD (may not be compatible w/ MC4100)
::R0010 (inducible by IPTG)
::R0011 (regulated by LacI)
::R0040 (regulated by TetR)
:-Terminator: B0015
:-RBS: B0030

==Things have to be done/decided==
#FecA, FecI, and FecR relationship w/ respect to control of one promoter
#Alternative methods for gene fusion: random mutation by circular permutation and XL1-Red
*Spec out FecA'-scFv
*Design primers for internal fusion
*Spec out FecA-scFv
*LambdaRed to make our own FecA-
*Obtain Fur- from Boston Medical Center -- POC Ray
*Specifying composite parts
*FecA, FecI, and FecR under same promoter may have issues 
*Make FecA- 
*Delete loops that's not necessary to make the FecA-scFv work
