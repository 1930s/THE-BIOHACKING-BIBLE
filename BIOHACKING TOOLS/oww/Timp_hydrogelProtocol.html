==Hydrogel Protocol==
Protocol for preparing PEGDA hydrogel, polymerizes under UV light.

==Materials==
*PEGDA (Poly ethylene glycol diacrylate)
**Acrylate-PEG-Acrylate-3400 (Laysan Bio, Inc.)or ACRL-3400 (NEKTAR 01010F12)
*Argon gas
*M9 Media (no antibiotics)
*Photo Initiator (2-Hydroxy-2-methyl-propiophenone, 97%, Sigma Aldrich 405655)
*1.5ml Microcentrifuge Tubes (Fisher Scientific)

==Making PEGDA==
#Weigh out 100 mg PEGDA into microcentrifuge tubes.
#*Note: If storing, close container inside glove bag while flowing argon and store in freezer.
#Add 10% wt/vol of M9 media 
#Spin at 10krpm for 20 minutes.
#Store in Fridge

==Sample Preparation== 
#Add 100 μL of PEGDA solution to micro-centrifuge tube
#Add 0.3 μL of photo initiator and vortex mix for 1 minute
#Add sample and pipette up and down gently.
