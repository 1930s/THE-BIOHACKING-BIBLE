==I2056==
*running 10uL of PCR on a small gel

==I2055==
*Sent samples to be sequenced

==T9002==
*Did PCR purification on MfeI digest, but DNA is very dilute: 13.1 ng/uL
*Trying double digest in parallel with NsiI digest

==E0240==
*Primers arrived to insert BB sites. See [[Registry/Measurement kit/Notebook/2007-7-2#Primer_Design|7/2.]]
