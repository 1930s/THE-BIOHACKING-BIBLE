==Overview==

How to count cells using Hemocytometer.

==Materials==

*PBS
*trypan blue soln.

==Procedure==
#Aspirate media.
#Wash with 1X PBS.
#Aspirate PBS.
#Resuspend in media â€“ make sure cells are completely resuspended, that they are not clumped together.
#Place coverslip on middle of hemocytometer.
#remove 500 ul of cells to microfuge tube.
#Add 50 ul of cell solution to 50 ul of trypan blue solution in a second microfuge tube.
#Add 20 ul of the final solution to each side of the hemocytometer. by letting a drop of liquid get taken into the slid by capillary action.
#Place hemocytometer on scope at 10X magification
#Locate center 5 x 5 grid.
#Move to higher power.
#Count all of the viable cells in the 5 x 5 grid. It is easier to count at higher power. Dead cells will be dark blue.
#Count the cells in two other 1 mm2 areas (one of the squares surrounding the center square). 
#Average the values for the final count.
