===Construction and Characterization of Riboregulators===
A Riboregulator is a post-transcriptional regulator used in bacteria.  Its mechanism for regulation involves the occlusion of the Ribosome via a hairpin on the mRNA transcript in the 'off' state thereby preventing (or 'locking') translation of the ORF.  The 'on' state is recovered by introducing a complementary sequence (or 'key') that disrupts the hairpin on the mRNA transcript allowing the Ribosome to bind and initiate translation.

===[[Sortostat]]===
The Sortostat is a microfluidic chemostat integrated with a cell sorter.  My project consists of demonstrating the sortostat's chemostat functionality, a technique rarely seen in microfluidics. 

'''Immediate Goals'''
*Debug all engineering-related problems with sortostat.
*Demonstrate Sortostat's ability to attain chemostasis in a population of E. Coli.
*Demonstrate Sortostat's ability to sort two phenotypically different populations of E. Coli.  In this case, I will be using a mixture of E. Coli expressing CFP and YFP. 
*Demostrate Sortostat's ability to select for an arbitrary population of cells that are phenotypically different from others and maintain this population at a steady state.
