At the May 22, 2007 meeting of the SynBERC devices working group, we discussed possible standards for measurement and characterization of standard biological parts.

Here are is a summary of the results of that meeting.  Please [[Talk:SynBERC:Devices/Standards|discuss these standards]].

==Measurement controls==
In order to facilitate comparison across characterization experiments from different labs, we generated the following list of measurement controls .

#Fluorescent calibration beads 
#*This control facilitates calibration across instruments and measurement technologies
#*Exact make and model to be determined
#Reference part: <bbpart>BBa_I7101</bbpart> in pSB1A2
#*Whenever possible this construct should be included as a reference part in experiments.  Results should be reported relative to this construct.
#*To be distributed via the [http://parts.mit.edu Registry of Standard Biological Parts] (contact [[User:Meaganl|Meagan Lizarazo]])

==Operating conditions==
In order to introduce more uniformity across characterization experiments from different labs, we generated the following list of defined operating conditions for parts and devices.

#Strain: DH10B or TOP10 (very similar strains)
#*This strain needs to be sequenced by the chassis thrust
#Vector: pSB1A3-P1010
#*This is a high copy vector with ampicillin resistance.  It may not be practical if load effects are an issue.
#Growth temperature: 37&deg;C
#Growth media: EZ Rich Defined Medium with 4% glycerol as the carbon source
#*Commercially available from  [http://www.teknova.com Teknova] [http://www.teknova.com/liquids/liquid-mops.shtml catalog # M2105 EZ Rich Defined Medium kit]
#*Additional information available at [[Neidhardt EZ Rich Defined]]
#OD600nm = 0.2
#*Need to decide what spectrophotometer to use for this measurement
#Fluorescent protein of choice: <bbpart>BBa_E0040</bbpart>
#Second fluorescent protein: an RFP variant to be determined
#Flask to culture volume?

==To do==
#Determine the appropriate RFP variant
#Select fluorescent calibration beads
#Submit pSB1A2-I7101 to the Registry ([[User:Reshma P. Shetty|RS]])
#Select a spectrophotometer for OD600nm measurements?
#Request that chassis thrust sequence DH10B/TOP10
