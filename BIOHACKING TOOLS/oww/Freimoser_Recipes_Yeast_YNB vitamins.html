=1000x vitamin solution for yeast nitrogen base=



===Remarks:===
The recipe described here is based on the description from the  [http://www.duke.edu/web/microlabs/mccusker/Resources/MediaRecipes.pdf| John McCusker lab]. In contrast to the original recipe  I have dissolved pyridoxine and thiamine in water instead of ethanol. Therefore I have added 4 ml EtOH to the ethanol-soluble vitamins in order to keep the volume the same. I have not checked if it is necessary to assure that all vitamins can be dissolved.

===Mixing===
Volumes for the preparation of 50 ml of a 1000x vitamin stock solution.
