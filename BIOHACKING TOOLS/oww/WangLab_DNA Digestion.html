===DNA Digestion===
# make mixture of DNA digestion reaction (total of ~10 ul):
#* a.	Desired DNA(e.g. from Miniprep)  					1 ul
#* b.	10X reaction buffer (dependent on enzymes) 			1 ul
#* c.	enzyme 1 (e.g. BamHI)						0.5 ul
#* d.	enzyme 2 (e.g. EcoRI)						0.5 ul
#* e.	H2O									1 ul
#* f.	100X BSA (Optional)						0.1 ul
# incubate the mixture in 37oC incubator for 2-3 hr.
# During the waiting time, prepare 1X TAE buffer (dilute the 50X TAE stock solution with H2O).
# make 50 ml 1% agarose gel solution for 1 gel tray (i.e. 0.5 agarose in 50 ml 1X TAE buffer).
# Microwave about 40 sec-1min until boiling and agarose completely dissolved. (Caution! avoid the over-spill).
# add 2.5 ul of EB and swirl to dissolve. 
# cool down a bit and pull the solution the gel tray of DNA electrophoresis system.
# Place desired combs in the gel solution to create the wells.
# when the digestion reaction is ready, take out reaction mixture, add 6X DNA loading buffer into the mixture and dilute to 1X (e.g. add 2 ul of 6X loading buffer to 10 ul reaction mixture). 
# load the reaction mixture in the gel wells (Donâ€™t forget the DNA ladder lane).
