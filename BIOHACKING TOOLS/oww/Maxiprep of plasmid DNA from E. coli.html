This protocol produces very clean, concentrated DNA, usually on the order of several mg/mL.  It is labor intensive.  Expect to spend most of the day doing it, but I like to store my plasmids in this form.

===Ingredients===
Ingredients are per culture; make enough for one extra culture to allow for pipetting error).

* 150&mu;L sterile 50% glycerol
* 1mL TEG (25mM Tris-Cl, 10mM EDTA, 50mM dextrose)
* 111&mu;L 20mg/mL lysozyme
* 2mL worth of components for solution 2: 200&mu;L 10% SDS, 100&mu;L 4M NaOH, 1.7 mL autoclaved water
* 1.5mL Solution 3: 3M K<sup>+</sup>, 5M acetate (3M potassium-acetate, 2M acetic acid -- glacial is 17M)
* 3.7mL isopropanol
* 1mL TE buffer
* 0.5mL 5M LiCl
* 7.5&mu;L 1mg/mL RNaseA
* 200&mu;L 70% ethanol
* several mL of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1)
* several mL of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1)
* 750&mu;L straight ethanol
* 125&mu;L 3M sodium acetate

===Directions===

#Grow a single colony of E. coli overnight in 50mL LB broth + selective markers at 37&deg;C.
#The next morning, put 850&mu;L of the culture in each of two Eppendorf tubes, add 150&mu;L sterile 50% glycerol, and store at -80&deg;C. Pour as much culture as will fit into an Oak Ridge tube and centrifuge at 5800g/6000rpm, 4&deg;C, for 10 minutes in a GSA rotor. Discard the supernatant, add the rest of the culture, and repeat. Resuspend in 1mL TEG.
#Add 111&mu;L 20mg/mL lysozyme. Incubate on ice for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, mix: 250&mu;L 10% SDS, 125&mu;L 4M NaOH, 2.125mL autoclaved water per culture.
#Add 2mL SDS/NaOH mix to each tube. Incubate on ice for 10 minutes.
#Add 1.5mL Solution 3 (3M K<sup>+</sup>, 5M acetate). Incubate on ice for 10 minutes.
#Shake vigorously. Centrifuge in SS34 rotor at 17,200g/12,000rpm, 4&deg;C, for 15 minutes.
#Pour the supernatant into another Oak Ridge tube and discard the pellet. Add 2.7mL isopropanol. Centrifuge at 17,200g/12,000rpm (room temperature) for 10 minutes. Discard the supernatant.
#Wash pellet with 1mL 70% ethanol. Air dry for 2-5 minutes on bench. Resuspend in 500&mu;L TE buffer. Add 500&mu;L 5M LiCl. Incubate on ice for 5 minutes.
#Centrifuge at 17,200g/12,000rpm for 10 minutes.
#Pour supernatant into an Eppendorf. Add 1mL isopropanol. Incubate on the bench for 10 minutes.
#Centrifuge at 17,200g/12,000rpm for 10 minutes.
#Discard the supernatant. Wash the pellets with 100&mu;L 70% ethanol. Resuspend in 375&mu;L TE buffer. Add 7.5&mu;L 1mg/mL RNaseA. Incubate at 37&deg;C for 30 minutes.
#Add 700&mu;L phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol. Vortex until thoroughly mixed. Centrifuge at top speed of microfuge for 2 minutes. Pipette aqueous phase (the top one) into new Eppendorf. Repeat until the interface between the phases is clear after centrifugation. Then repeat the procedure twice with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol to remove any phenol.
#Add 750&mu;L straight ethanol and 125&mu;L 3M sodium acetate. Put at -80&deg;C for 30 minutes or -20&deg;C overnight.
#Centrifuge at 13,600g/12,000rpm, 4&deg;C, for 15 minutes. Discard the supernatant. Wash pellet with ~100&mu;L 70% ethanol. Resuspend in 100-200&mu;L TE buffer.
