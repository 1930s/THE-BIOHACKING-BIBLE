There are a few tests we can get started on before the complete SP2.0 is constructed.

=Induction system test=

==AHL-induction test==
*<bbpart>I13546</bbpart> (F2620 + GFP/RFP) on psb3K3
*<bbpart>I13547</bbpart> (F2621 + GFP/RFP) on psb3K3

===Results===
====Date?====
*<add images when finished processing data>
*Looks like the GFP is responding well over a range of AHL conentrations.  So the induction system itself looks pretty good.  In fact the GFP expression was higher than we had seen with pBAD on a high copy (psb1A2) plasmid, and F262X were on 3k3.
*However, the RFP is displaying low fluorecence intensity.  Planning experiments to figure out why - see below.
*Also, the data collection was set to linear scale, so will be redoing this experiment on 9/21/2006

====9/21/2006====
*<bbpart>I13546</bbpart> (F2620 + GFP/RFP) on psb3K3
**Induced 1nM, 10nM, 50nM, 100nM, 500nM, 1uM
*<bbpart>I13547</bbpart> (F2621 + GFP/RFP) on psb3K3
**Induced 1nM, 5nM, 10nM, 50nM, 100nM, 1uM
*The variation in the induction levels was based on the results of the previous experiment, which demonstrated over which induction range the device was switching in response to AHL.

==RFP expression tests==

===Date?===
*Will be comparing the expression of several costructs:
*#<bbpart>I13530</bbpart> - pbad controlled RFP
*#<bbpart>I13521</bbpart> - Ptet controlled RFP
*#<bbpart>I13549</bbpart> - F2620 controlled RFP
*#<bbpart>I13550</bbpart> - F2621 controlled RFP
*#<bbpart>I13551</bbpart> - F2620 controlled RnaseE+hairpin+RFP
*#<bbpart>I13552</bbpart> - F2621 controlled RnaseE+hairpin+RFP
*All will be induced at the highest induction level (except tet which is constitive in this case because no tetR present).
*<flojo plots here>
*The RFP lacking the RnaseE site and the hairpin produced a weaker signal in response to equivalent induction.  This is counter to some of our previous results using the pBAD induction system.  Should consider revisiting those.

=SP1.0 debugging=
Understanding the issues with GFP/RFP relationship in SP1.0 will help us to better debug SP2.0 down the line.

==Arabinose test==
Will use a construct that has a constituitive promoter (R0074) driving expression of GFP/RFP.  Will then grow in the presence of varying levels of arabinose and look at the effect on GFP/RFP levels.
