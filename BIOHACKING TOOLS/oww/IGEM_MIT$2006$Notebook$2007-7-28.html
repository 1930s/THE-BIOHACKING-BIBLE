None of the cultures look grown.  I kept the minimal media without amino acid cultures in the warm room since these are known to take longer to grow.  Sequencing from J45120 reveals that both J45120 and J45181 have the same mutation late in the coding region of BSMT.

1. Make LCs around 9 PM tonight from the B0015, J45995, J45996, and R0040.E0840 plates

2. Remake 700+ since the flask broke

3. Redo cultures with the amino acids added to minimal media after autoclaving more (did not look totally dissolved)
