The guidelines for citing some material from the wiki are now slightly different from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_Wikipedia Wikipedia's policy]. Here is what you want to cite, in order to guarantee a fair attribution of the works and guarantee the contents of what you are referring to:
* '''Authors''':
** the name of the major contributors, if listed explicitely in the article, are given first; they should generally be followed by "Wikiomics authors" to account for anonymous or smaller contributions, e.g. ''' ''AuthorX'', ''AuthorY'', ''AuthorZ'' and Wikiomics authors''',
** or just '''Wikiomics authors''' if there is no dedicated [[Meta:Credits|Credits]] section at the bottom of the article
* '''Title''': the title of the article
* '''Date''': the date of the revision that you are citing
* '''Publisher''': Wikiomics
* '''Reference''': the URL of the article, preferrably a frozen version taken from the history of the article since you don't want to cite an ever changing document: click on the "history" tab, then click on the date of the latest version and copy its URL. For example, the first revision of the present page is [http://wikiomics.org/index.php?title=Meta:Citing_This_Wiki here]
