=Description=
SOB/SOC is a richer media than LB. Suitable for growth of large batch cultures, strains with growth complex growth requirements, and recovery after transformation (Gram neg. species). This media is a slight pain to make. It is good to keep the SOB without the MgCl2 added. We call this SOB-. Also, everything loves to grow in SOC. Make small volumes and if it looks bad... DO NOT USE IT!!!
=Recipe=
==SOB==
Per 950 ml of H2O:
*Tryptone: 20g
*Yeast Extract: 5g
*NaCl: 0.5g

Dissolve components. Then add 10ml of 250mM KCl. pH with NaOH (5 to 10M). Correct volume to 1L.

After autoclaving, just before use, add 5ml 2M MgCl2.

==SOC==
To SOB add, 20ml of 1M glucose. If you have a 50 w/v% stock of glucose, use 8ml.
