Abstract:

<br>Whole animal testing is an essential part in evaluating the toxicological and
pharmacological profiles of chemicals and pharmaceuticals, but these experiments are
expensive and cumbersome. A cell culture analog (CCA) system, when used in
conjunction with a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model, provides an
in vitro supplement to animal studies and the possibility of a human surrogate for
predicting human response in clinical trials. A PBPK model mathematically simulates
animal metabolism by modeling the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination
kinetics of a chemical in interconnected tissue compartments. A CCA uses
mammalian cells cultured in interconnected chambers to physically represent the
corresponding PBPK. These compartments are connected by recirculating tissue culture
medium that acts as a blood surrogate. The purpose of this article is to describe the
design and basic operation of the microscale manifestation of such a system. Microscale
CCAs offer the potential for inexpensive, relatively high throughput evaluation of
chemicals while minimizing demand for reagents and cells. Using microfabrication
technology, a three-chamber (“lung”-“liver”-“other”) microscale cell culture analog
(íCCA) device was fabricated on a 1 in. (2.54 cm) square silicon chip. With a design
flow rate of 1.76 íL/min, this íCCA device achieves approximate physiological liquidto-
cell ratio and hydrodynamic shear stress while replicating the liquid residence time
parameters in the PBPK model. A dissolved oxygen sensor based on collision quenching
of a fluorescent ruthenium complex by oxygen molecules was integrated into the
system, demonstrating the potential to integrate real-time sensors into such devices.
