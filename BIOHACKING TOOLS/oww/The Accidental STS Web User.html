This wiki is a "how to" list of new web tools or "hacks" that are of use to STS researchers and educators.  It is written in the spirit of the fictional "Accidental Tourist" travel guides, which were guides for tourists who did not like traveling.  In other words, this is a list of educational and research web tools that may be of interest to scholars who are not generally keen on playing around with the web or such digital tools for the the sheer sake of it.  I will therefore keep instruction simple, and, with each tool, I will first describe why of for whom it might be useful and time-saving.
