== Integrin Antibodies ==

*Wow-1, binds to high affinity unoccupied integrins avb3, detecting affinity increase
*LIBS-6,binds to occupied b3 and stablize it, therefore activate it, with high concentration 15ug/ml
*HUTS-21 , binds to occupied u1 and stablize it, activate
*EDTA, specifically block binding to avb3.
*16G3, block unoccupied FN sites (avb3, a5b1)
*3B8, block unoccupied FN sites (a5b1)
*11E5, non-blocking control for 16G3, 3B8
*661, blocking binding sites on Vitronectin for avb3
*443, non-blocking control for 661.
*MnCl2, activates all the integrins (0.5mM).
