*'''Conclusions:'''
** streptavidin band clear
** biotinylated oligos coomassie band clear too, in different place
***there are definitely streptavidin-bound biotinylated oligos in lane 3
** it is difficult to see in the image, but a darker blue band was visible at the top of lane 5, where the nanostructure should be
*** streptavidin bound to Eb
*** unfortunately, Eb = inside-biotinylation -latches, so how the streptavidin bound and was visualized when the Gb (outside-biotinylation +latch1) didn't bind it is questionable
*** it is a very faint band
** no bands were seen at the top of the gel in the expected lane 6 (Gb)

*'''is it possible that streptavidin actually bound to nanostructures can't be stained w/ coomassie?''' 
**that would explain why the inside-biotinylated +latch1 design, which would not (we expect) permit the biotinylated-oligos within to bind streptavidin, shows a lot more unbound streptavidin and biotinylated-oligos-bound streptavidin


===PAGE EtBr Gel Imaging of Superconcentration of Eb, Fb, and Gb===

* as a first try, the gel was destained a further 30min in H2O before EtBr staining was attempted
* 200mL of H2O +7uL of EtBr were used as a stain; the gel was allowed to stain for 15 min

* no luck, no bands at all were seen under UV
** will save gel in H2O till figure out if there is anything to be done about it

===More Folding Reactions for Further Superconcentration Experiments with Stains-All===

* made working stocks (=12.5 rxns) for:
**outside-biotinylation w/o latches, '''Eb''' 
**outside-biotinylation w/ "future" (aka four-oligo, aka latch2, aka staple latches) latches, '''Ib'''
***latching which can be attempted post-incubation
***can be incubated at 37&deg;C for 1hr with the zipper oligos (c4.0.23, 24, 25), though latches can be used in the first incubation
**inside-biotinylation w/o latches, '''Db''' 
**inside-biotinylation w/ latches, '''Hb'''

* folded according to given protocol, using FOLDINGD

==Folding for MgCl2 and 6x Titrations, Take Two==

*because the gel from yesterday of the previoius titration showed no bands whatsoever, the reactions were refolded as [[IGEM:Harvard/2006/DNA_nanostructures/Notebook/2006-8-3#Titration_of_.5BMgCl2.5D_and_.5Boligos.5D_in_Folding_Rxns|before]]
*the reactions were, as usual, folded with the FOLDINGD program

==3D models continued==
Added scales to two images; Sketchup file now posted under Design 5 schematics.
