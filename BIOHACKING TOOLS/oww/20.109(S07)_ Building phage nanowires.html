===Part 1: Co treatment of phage===
===Part 2: Research proposal===
You will have an opportunity during lab to talk with a person from '''another''' lab group. This person will offer you a fresh ear to consider your proposal. Try to describe your research problem to them. Articulate why it's important. Tell them about some recent, relevant data. Describe what you're proposing to do and what the findings from your experiments might reveal. Throughout your discussion, keep careful track of the questions they ask since these will point you to the confusing concepts or fuzzy parts of your explanation or understanding. 

Then be a good listener to hear the proposal that they've been working on. Ask lots of questions. No questions are dumb. You are there to offer a naive ear and seek complete explanations. You will have time at the very end of class to reconvene with your own lab partner to hear how their conversation went. Try to identify repeated questions or concerns since these are probably the holes in the project as it stands. You can rework your proposal based on the conversations you've had.

==For Next Time==
# Outline your research proposal presentation. Recall that you will need to present
#* a brief project overview (1 slide)
#* sufficient background information for everyone to understand your proposal (1-3 slides) 
#* a statement of the research problem and goals (1 slide) 
#* project details and methods (3-5 slides)
#* predicted outcomes if everything goes according to plan and if nothing does (3-5 slides)
#* needed resources to complete the work (1 slide)
#* societal impact if all goes well (1 slide)
Suggested numbers of slides are listed here but the number may vary depending on the particulars of your proposal. You will have time to work on the presentation in lab next time as well as ask questions about the format, but you should begin to prepare, in powerpoint or similar presentation program, the materials you need.
