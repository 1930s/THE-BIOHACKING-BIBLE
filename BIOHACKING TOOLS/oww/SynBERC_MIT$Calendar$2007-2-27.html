There is no particular discussion topic scheduled but it might be nice to
#quickly recap the highlights of the SynBERC meeting for those who weren't there
#brainstorm more potential discussion topics that we want to cover for the spring (since we've covered a fair amount of ground thus far)

If there are any issues folks want to raise with the group, they are welcome since there will likely be time in the schedule.
