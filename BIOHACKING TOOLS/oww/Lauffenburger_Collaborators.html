[http://web.mit.edu/lgglab '''Linda Griffith's''' laboratory (MIT)] attempts to understand and control cell interactions with surfaces with a focus on applications in tissue engineering and cell culture. Projects encompass two complementary areas: synthesis and modification of polymeric materials, and characterization of cell and tissue responses to materials.

[http://www.virginia.edu/biology/develbio/faculty/horwitz.htm '''Rick Horwitz's''' laboratory (University of Virginia)] is actively investigating many aspects of the structure and function of integrin molecules and the processes they mediate. Recent progress includes elucidation of the roles of several different integrins during (muscle) differentiation.

[http://path.upmc.edu/divisions/wells-lab/wells.htm '''Alan Wells's''' laboratory (UPitt)] researches growth factor receptor-mediated cell locomotion and its consequences in physiologic and pathologic situations. The laboratory is investigating motility signaling from the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as our model system.

[http://www.sysbio.org/resources/staff/wiley.stm '''Steve Wiley's'''] research interests have focused on understanding mechanisms of cell communication and signaling using the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) system as a model. He pioneered methods for the quantitative analysis of receptor dynamics in mammalian cells and published some of the first computer models of receptor regulation. He has been a major contributor to the field of receptor research, particularly with regard to the control of receptor distribution within cells.
