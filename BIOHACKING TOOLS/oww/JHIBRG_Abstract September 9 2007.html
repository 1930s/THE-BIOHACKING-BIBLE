'''Structure and Function of Keratins'''

As a cytoskeleton, intermediate filaments (IF) provide cells with scaffold to other proteins as well as mechanical resistance from environmental trauma. Among IF proteins, keratins have unique features including hetero-dimer formation and specific expression in epithelia.
Functional importance of keratins has been envisioned by studying keratin-related disease such as Epidermolysis Bulosa Simplex, a skin blistering disorder due to keratin mutations. To study function and disease mechanism, structure/function reationship of keratin would be very useful. This talk will outline structural tools in biology and show how structural biology can be applied to study keratins.
