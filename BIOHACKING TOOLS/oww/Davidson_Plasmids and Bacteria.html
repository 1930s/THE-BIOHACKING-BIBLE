* Transform bacteria  '''We are using ''Salmonella typhimurium'' for the Hin protein as it was the referenced species in all of the literature.'''
* Create RE biobrick (completed)
*Isolating genomic DNA from Salmonella typhimurium (completed)
*Ordered oligos for recombinational enhancer and primers for the hin gene
**These sequences will be transformed into RFP and possibly GFP plasmids
*Performed Minipreps to isolate RFP and GFP plasmids to be used for transformations.
