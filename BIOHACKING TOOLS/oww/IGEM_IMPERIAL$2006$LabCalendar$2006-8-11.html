==Control Digests for finalized prey cell J37015 & pSB1A2==
[[Image:PreyCellDigest.JPG|400px|right]]
*Gel of the digests from yesterday was run and assessed: See results on the right. 
*Gel: (from left to right)
**Lanes 1-3: Recombinant Plasmid A (Digest 1-3)
**Lanes 4-6: Insert Plasmid 12D->24A (Digest1-3)
**Lanes 7-9: Vector Plasmid 6B (Digest 1-3)
*Lane 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 have bands at expected lengths
*Other unexpected lengths might have occured due to contamination - and probably PvuII did not work correctly. 
*Overall, suggests that the sequence of the plasmid is correct.

==Culture==
*J37015RS and J37016 being cultured in liquid media for miniprep this afternoon
*2 plates of J37015RS and 3 plates of J37016 are being analysed, each containing 6 colonies each

==PCR==

*Dr. Mann's PCR was successful for the immunotag, however was unsuccessful for the LoxP sites
*This is being redone using slightly different temperatures
*The Cre part was successfully PCR-ed without the help of Dr.Mann
*Four Cre parts was cut out of the gel available for ligating

==Ligations==
*AiiA was given to us by Dr. Mann in gel format and we isolated the Cre parts (above)
*These were ligated into the hanging T plasmid Dr. Mann gave us
**Ligation started at 14:30

==To do tomorrow==
*Gene Clean Ligations Cre & AiiA parts
*Maxiprep 2H again
*Miniprep J37015RS and J37016

NO PCR on next Tuesday only one of the machines.  Will be returned on wednesday.  Will be used again on wednesday or thursday.
