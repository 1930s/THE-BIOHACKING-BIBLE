Protocol for extraction of DNA from tissue or embryos.

==ProK Digestion==
#Mix DNA extraction buffer
#*98 &mu;l [[Oneill_Lab:Chemicals#ReagentB|ReagentB]]
#*2 &mu;l ProteinaseK
#*Mix fresh. 100 &mu;l is enough for a small pea size chunk of tissue or one embryo
#Place small piece of tissue or embryo into a microfuge tube containing 100 &mu;l of extraction buffer
#Incubate at 50&deg;C overnight

==PCI==
#Prepare PCI mix
##One part tris-saturated phenol to one part 24:1 Chloroform:Isoamyl alcohol
##Shake thoroughly to make emulsion
#Add one volume of PCI to extracted sample
#Shake tubes for 10 seconds
#Centrifuge at max speed for 5 minutes
#Remove aqueous phase to a new tube
#Repeat as needed
#Add one volume 24:1 chloroform:isoamyl alcohol
#Shake tubes for 10 seconds
#Centrifuge at max speed for 5 minutes
#Remove aqueous phase to a new tube
#Continue to precipitation

==Ethanol Precipitation==
#Add 2 volumes 100% EtOH
#Add 1/10 volume 3M Sodium Acetate pH 5.0
#Centrifuge at max speed for 10 minutes
#Decant ethanol
#Add 150 &mu;l 70% EtOH
#Centrifuge at max speed for 2 minutes
#Pipette out ethanol
#Airdry pellet
#Resuspend pellet in MilliQ water
