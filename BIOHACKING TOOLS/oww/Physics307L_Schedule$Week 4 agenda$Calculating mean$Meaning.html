==(52 +/- 1) ms==
=="I think the fall time of ''my'' oscilloscope was 52 ms.  Assuming my systematic error was negligible, then based on analysis of my random error (repeated measurments), and assuming it is normally distributed, there is a 68% chance that the true fall time is between 51 and 53 ms"==
