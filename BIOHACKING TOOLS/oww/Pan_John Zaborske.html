My research focuses on understanding the relationship between GCN2, eIF2 and tRNA.  GCN2 is a protein kinase which is part of the general amino acid control pathway and is activated upon cellular stress (eg amino acid starvation).  When uncharged tRNA binds GCN2 it phosphorylates eIF2 which in turn activates a pathway leading to downregulation of translation and upregulation of amino acid biosynthetic genes. By using a variety of techniques including tRNA microarrays I am examining the activation of this pathway under different stress conditions.
