==Input Reception==
====Questions====
# Is our fluorescein dimer entering into the cell?
# Distance in space between flurs. -- might depend on 3D conformation/wobblyness
# Separate out single from double stranded

====Experiments====
# Lets throw the oligos in, wash the media, look for flur. and we can hope that means its diffused
#* control: normal fluor. -- don't touch the oligos just yet
#* READOUT: can we see it under a microscope? get antibody -- into cytoplasm? selectivly trash outer membrane? will's oligo thingy?
