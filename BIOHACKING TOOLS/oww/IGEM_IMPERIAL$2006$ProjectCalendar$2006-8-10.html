===Discussion with Tom===

fews things need to be cleared asap:
*Which medium to be used in testing + final experiment, LB or M9 ? We have to take different things into account:
**Fluorescent backround
**Growth rate for the culture
**Medium should allow aiiA activity (Zinc hypothesis)
**Medium should allow AHL production
**<font color=red>Some quick experiments should be designed and done.</font>

*The Victor 3 equipment only allows OD 490nm absorbance, <font color=red>we should check what is the difference with OD600 (growth curves).</font>
*What is the impact of GFP production on growth rate in T9002 ?
