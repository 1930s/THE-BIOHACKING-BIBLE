''This is our protocol for making [[M9 medium/supplemented|supplemented M9 medium]].''

==Component Concentrations==
*[[M9 medium/minimal|M9 minimal medium]] containing glycerol as the carbon source supplemented with - 
*1mM thiamine hydrochloride
*0.2% casamino acids

==Protocol==
For 1L of media
*500ml 2x[[M9 salts]] &lowast;
*30ml 10 mg/ml thiamine hydrochloride
*#Dissolve 10 mg per ml of H<sub>2</sub>O
*#Filter-sterilize using a 0.22&mu;m filter
*#Light-sensitive: store covered
*10ml 40% glycerol &lowast;
*20ml 10% casamino acids &lowast;
*20ml 0.1M MgSO<sub>4</sub> &lowast;
*200&mu;l 0.5M CaCl<sub>2</sub> &lowast;
*419.8ml sterile deionized H<sub>2</sub>O &lowast;

Combine above solutions using sterile technique.  (May notice some precipitation during preparation but precipitate should go back into solution once volume is brought up to 1l with sterile H<sub>2</sub>O.)<br>
Add antibiotic as appropriate and store at 4&deg;C

&lowast; Can be obtained from the [[Endy:Building 68 kitchen stocks|media room]]
