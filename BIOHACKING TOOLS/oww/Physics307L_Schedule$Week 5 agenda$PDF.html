==From wikipedia==
A '''probability density function''' is any function ''f''(''x'') that describes the probability density in terms of the input variable ''x'' in a manner described below. 
* ''f''(''x'') is greater than or equal to zero for all values of ''x''
* The total area under the graph is 1:
::<math> \int_{-\infty}^\infty \,f(x)\,dx = 1. </math>

The actual probability can then be calculated by taking the integral of the function ''f''(''x'') by the integration interval of the input variable ''x''. 

For example: the probability of the variable ''X'' being within the interval [4.3,7.8] would be

:<math>\Pr(4.3 \leq X \leq 7.8) = \int_{4.3}^{7.8} f(x)\,dx.</math>

For example, the continuous uniform distribution on the interval [0,1] has probability density ''f''(''x'') = 1 for 0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 1 and ''f''(''x'') = 0 elsewhere. The standard normal distribution has probability density

:<math>f(x)={e^{-{x^2/2}}\over \sqrt{2\pi}}</math>

If a random variable ''X'' is given and its distribution admits a probability density function ''f''(''x''), then the expected value of ''X'' (if it exists) can be calculated as

:<math>\operatorname{E}(X)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty x\,f(x)\,dx</math>
