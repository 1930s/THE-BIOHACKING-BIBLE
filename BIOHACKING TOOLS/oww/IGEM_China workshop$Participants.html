=='''PKU Team'''==

*[http://162.105.154.2:40150/wiki/index.php/Main_Page more information for PKU]
===Team members===
Just on the day that the iGEM China ambassadors came to the Peking University, Dec 28th, 2006, we, approximately ten undergraduates and a couple of graduates of PKU,founded the iGEM PKU team. After several times of expansion, 20 students and 2 leading teachers and several other advisors are actively contributing to our team, yet formal enrollment has not been ruled out.<br />

The two leading teachers of our team are Prof. Yiping Wang from Life Science College and Dr. Fangting Li from Center for Theoretical Biology. They will not only provide us with beneficial instructions through out the competition, but also will represent our team to attend “Teach the teachers” this June and lead us to the jamboree held in MIT this November. Besides the two teachers mentioned above, three additional advisors, Prof. Qi Ouyang from Center for Theoretical Biology as well as College of Physics, Dr. Luhua Lai from Center for Theoretical Biology and College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering as well, and Prof. Jin Xu from School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, would like to make joint efforts to help us with more constructive directions, too. Since our team is under rapid development, it is believed that a increasing number of teachers would join us in the future.
<br />
Student members of our team include 3 Ph.D. candidates and 17 undergraduates with a variety of majors, including physics, chemistry, biology. With further development of iGEM-PKU, students of the other department might also join the team. More details are available on our Wiki:  
http://wiki.igempku.cn/index.php/Student_members. 

===Team activities===
	Dec. 28th 2006  iGEM-PKU was founded and the organization of team activities was primarily discussed <br />
	Jan. 7th 2007  the first preparation conference for iGEM-PKU was held and the following contents were discussed, including <br />
	How to manage iGEM-PKU efficiently<br />
	the schedule and the fashion of regular team activities<br />
	Funds raising<br />
	Seeking various kinds of academic suppo <br />

	Jan. 14th , 2007  the first team journal club was held<br />
	Jan. 21st, 2007  against the freezing weather, the second seminar was held enthusiasticly.  <br />
	Mar. 3rd, 2007  weekly journal club with only PKU team members attending was determined to be one regular form of team activities .<br /> 
	4 weekly meetings has been held, concentrating on the discussion of following topics: the canonical papers of synthetic biology, the winning projects of past competitions, presentations of optional ideas for PKU team.<br />

In order to improve the performance of iGEM-PKU both systematically and sustainingly, the team has applied to the university for the foundation of “iGEM society”. 

We have already gone through the first two checkups and are now preparing for the final examination diligently. If we succeed, all team routines will be proceeding under the name of PKU-iGEM, offering convenience for the advancement of our competition and further propagandization of synthetic biology in Peking University.

===Project Ideas===
In the past 5 weeks, our weekly journal has been focusing on the discussion of project ideas. We have proposed 6 projects and many more are being prepared. The full list of proposed ideas can be visited at our Wiki: http://wiki.igempku.cn/index.php/Project_ideas . This part of the wiki is under extensive development and is updated on a daily basis.
<br />
Below, the abstract of the very first proposed and the best prepared idea is posted, as an example:
An in vivo evolution approach towards the discovery of novel ligands at orphan G-protein coupled receptors
Directed evolution is a technique often used to optimize biological parts for a desired function, despite the laborious manual screen of mutants iteratively. We proposal to develop a standardized in vivo evolution technique in yeast cells using human B cell AID gene with which many genes can be optimized for a certain function and genes with novel functions can be discovered. In particular, we plan to apply it to the discovery of ligands for orphan G-protein coupled receptors(GPCR), using GFP expression controlled by MAP kinase pathway as a target function, automatically screened by FACS. If succeed, the possible large amounts of ligands we discovered will be good candidates for neurological drugs, and the technique developed will greatly enhance the development of synthetic biology.
<br />
Here are the title of a few more:<br/>
	Study on the regulatory network of genetically engineered macrophage<br />
	Utilizing the E.coli SOS system to achieve fast response<br />
	Implementing a hop count in E.coli to demonstrate amorphous computing<br />
	Enable E. coli to gather protein molecules<br />
	Rapid and high throughput dead-or-alive selection of fluorescent C.elegans<br />

====Lab and Funding====
Prof. YJ Yuan kindly provides experiment environment and most of the financial support. 

Also our team gets the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Tianjin University.

====Primary proposals:====
====Synthetic Biology related technology====
*Logic gate(AND,OR,NOT,NAND,NOR,XOR):We combine some of them to construct several devices, such as DOUBLE CONTROL SWITCH, NUMERUS COMPARATOR, INCONSISTENT CIRCUIT, SR 

FLIP FLOP, ENCODER, CLOCK, much of them come from the electrocircuit consideration.
*Simulate reversible reaction: We try to simulate the reversible reaction with considering the impact of catalyzer, temperature, concentration and pressure. To use 

two fluorescence reporters, we can monitor the reaction direction by the colour varying.
*System controlling lytic/ lysogenic states: By cell-to-cell communication, we try to construct a system that a signal from a cell can control the lytic/ lysogenic 

states of cell infected by phage and using different reporter according to the different state.
*As we all know, time delay is very common in biology system. Is there some method that we can take use of this time delay? So we can use it to all the situations 

change is needed.
Because biological system is unpredictable and couldn’t control strictly as electrocircuit, there are still many problems we must face. We proceed with all the ideas 

but focus on the most feasible.
====Other inspiration====
Besides the logic application in our biological machine, we also hope to find other inspiration in energy and medicine issues. Surely, we get closer and closer to the 

final project.
====We are looking forward to your attention to our team====

====Project 1====
'''ene circuit'''
The aim of our project is to simulate electrocircuit in series and parallel connection by gene elements. Series circuit and parallel circuit are the simplest circuits 

in physics. There are three eletments in it: switch, power and resistance. What we should do is to construct three kinds of bacterials functioning as the three 

elements in electrocircuit, seperately: one for power, the other two for resistances(R1 and R2). Light is used as a switch. The gene circuit is connected when the 

bacterials are supposed to light so that the flurescence proteins with different colors in the three kind of bacterials are all expressed, while the circuit is cut 

when we turn the light off. In series circuit, If we cut any of the resistances or power, it will result in the disconnection of the whole circuit, while in parallel 

circuit, the lack of one resistance will not influence the other one. Three different kinds of HSL are used as the cell to cell signals.
====Project 2====
'''Bacterial neon light'''
In this project ,we use gene circle to create a bacterial neon light with three different colors. the first repressor protein, LacI from E. coli, inhibits the 

transcription of the second repressor gene, tetR from the tetracycline-resistance transposon Tn10, whose protein product in turn inhibits the expression of a third 

gene, cI from λ phage. Finally, CI inhibits lacI expression, completing the cycle. The three repressors are connected with red, green, and yellow luc genes (a kind 

of luminescent gene) seperately. With the oscillation of the gene circle, the three colors of light will show up circularly, just as a neon light.

===Proposal===
Despite the exciting advancement in recent years, phage contamination is still one of the headaches that nowadays the food and fermentation industries mainly 

confront. Some strains with genotype like TonA is resistant to T1-like bacteriophages, but the productive performance of these strains is low because of the slow 

growth rates. Therefore, the producer is facing a dilemma: how can we deal with the strains lacking phage resistance, but with high productivity, and strains with 

certain kind of phage resistance but the productivity of which is rather low. <br />
To help those unfortunate guys, we aim at developing an inexpensive system to offer the industries a new kind of strain that can grow fast and without phage 

infection.<br />
There are two different strategies for the active defense:<br />
One is the ‘Signaler Strategy’, that is, let a cell infected with bacteriophages send a signal telling other cells that the enemy is coming. In this way the others 

will switch on the expression of TonA , making themselves resistant to the enemy.<br />
There are two key points for this strategy. Firstly, what can be used as such a signal? It should be rare in the environment in most occasions, and its number ought 

to increase fast after the infection. Secondly, how to switch on the expression of TonA? The response should be as quick as possible, or the enemy will invade in 

without any resistance!<br />
The other strategy is the ‘Sacrifice Strategy’, that is, when the phage begins to reproduce itself, the apoptosis system of the host will be switched on. The host 

commits suicide to avoid the propagation of the phages, and without influencing the others.<br />
Also, there is a key point for this strategy, that is, how to make the reaction as quick as possible .And another one is how to keep the apoptosis off under normal 

conditions.<br />
Both of the strategies might be applied to reinforce the self-defense ability of cells.<br />
