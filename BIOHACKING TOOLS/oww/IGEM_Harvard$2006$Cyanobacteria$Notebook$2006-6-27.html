==Sequence of PCRing==
We've decided to lift the whole ''KaiABC'' segment out of cyanobacteria first, then break it into pieces later (''KaiA'' operon, ''KaiA'' coding region, ''KaiBC'' operon, ''KaiBC'' coding region), since it's easier to work with shorter lengths of DNA.

There are 3 BioBrick restriction sites in ''KaiABC'' which we will need to modify with site-directed mutagenesis before inserting the sequence into a plasmid. This step will come immediately after or concurrent with the first PCR (check on this? -Jeff).

==Primer design==
We spent the afternoon designing primers. See [[IGEM:Harvard/2006/Cyanobacteria_Literature#Primer_Design | our primer design section]].
==More PCC 7942==
We asked Alain to order a new stock of PCC 7942 for us, from the [http://www.attc.org ATCC].
