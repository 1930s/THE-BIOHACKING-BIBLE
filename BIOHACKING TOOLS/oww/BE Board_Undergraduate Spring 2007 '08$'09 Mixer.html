=='08 and '09 Mixer ==
As a kickoff event for the evolving undergraduate program in Course 20, the students attending the planning session will be organizing a mixer type event to allow the current '08 and '09 classes to meet and interact in a social setting.

==Date, Time==
Tentative: Tuesday, May 1, 7-9pm

==Venue and Activity Ideas==

For our first mixer, we propose an informal '08-'09 dinner study break on campus serving Thai food.


As a starting point for brainstorming future events, these are previous events by the graduate board:
*Bowling
*Softball
*Pool at Flat Top Jonny's
*BBQ near Kresge
*Floor hockey in the Z-center

==Comments/Suggestions==
