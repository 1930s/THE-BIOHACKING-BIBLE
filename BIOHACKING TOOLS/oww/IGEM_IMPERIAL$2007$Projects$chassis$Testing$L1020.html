'''Considerations:'''
*Use highly purified DNA templates (e.g., CsCl- or gel-purified).
*Inhibition of the expression caused by excess salts(NaCl ≥50mM), glycerol (≥1%), or by very small
amounts of magnesium or potassium salts. 
*In addition DNA purification kits should use sodium acetate rather than ammonium acetate. Typical yields range
