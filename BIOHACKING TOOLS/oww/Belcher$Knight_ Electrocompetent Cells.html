==Electrocompetent Cells==


From Danijela Dukovski at Harvard Medical School.  This protocol works well.

===Materials===
DI water<br>  
10% Glycerol<br>

===Special Equipment===
Centrifuge<br>
Ice water bath<br>
Liquid nitrogen<br>

===Method===
Grow 500ml culture to OD 0.5 (approximately).

Spin down cells 5 times in ice cold 10% sterile glycerol.

Keep everything on ice and use a refrigerated centrifuge.

Each time you resuspend use a progressively smaller volume, and make sure all the cells are well resuspended.  At the end resuspend in an appropriate volume.  It should be pretty cloudy but not super dense.  I just do it by eye, so it comes out about like the competent cells you buy.  

Aliquot into Eppendorf tubes (I use 250-500uL, depending on how much I have and how lazy I am), freeze in liquid nitrogen, and store at -80.

How I usually do the washes:
spin, resuspend in 250ml
spin, resuspend in 100ml
spin, resuspend in 50ml (can switch to Falcon tubes here)
spin, resuspend in 25ml
spin, resuspend in 10ml
spin, final resuspension

Sometimes I cut one of these out depending on how much of a hurry I am in.  I think the final volume (depends on the intial OD of your cells) usually ends up being 5-10mL, so you can get quite a few aliquots.

For transformation usually use 40-50uL of competent cells per transformation with a few ul (2-3) of ligation.
