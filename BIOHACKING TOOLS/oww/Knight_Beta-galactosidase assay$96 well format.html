This protocol is directly derived from [[User:Smoore|Sean Moore's]] [[Beta-Galactosidase Assay (A better Miller)]].  Please go there for the original protocol.  

This protocol is an attempt to modify the protocol to 96 well format for assaying many samples in parallel.  

==Materials==
*96 deep well plates for growing cultures
**Square wells aerate the cultures better
*96 well plates for the assay itself
**[[User:Kgriff|Kevin Griffith]] (<cite>Griffith-2002</cite>) uses Marsh brand (MP-9091) 96 well plates available through ThermoFisher Scientific (but not available on the website).  This plate is a polystyrene plate that has a max well volume of 0.3ml.  The wells are a flat bottom design.  These plates are not coated or treated.  The MP-9091 is packaged as 100 plates per case.

*500mM dibasic sodium phosphate (Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>)
**1M Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> seems to come out of solution in my hands.
*4M potassium chloride (KCl)
*1M magnesium sulfate (MgSO<sub>4</sub>)
*1% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)
*10% sodium deoxcholate (light-sensitive, stored at 4&deg;C)
*1M NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>
*o-nitrophenyl-&beta;-D-Galactoside ONPG (solid)
*1M sodium carbonate (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>)

See [[Talk:Knight:Beta-galacosidase assay]] for stock solution recipes.

===Permeabilization Solution===
For 8mL:
*1.6 mL 500 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>
*40 &mu;L 4M KCl
*16 &mu;L 1M MgSO<sub>4</sub>
*480 &mu;L 1% CTAB
*32 &mu;L 10% sodium deoxycholate
*43.2 &mu;L TCEP (it is a more stable reducing agent than &beta;-mercaptoethanol)
H<sub>2</sub>O to 8mL
(You need 80 &mu;L per sample.  This is enough for a 96 well plate.)

===Substrate solution===
For 15mL
*1.8mL 500mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>
*600&mu;L 1M NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>
*15 mg ONPG
*40.5 &mu;L TCEP (more stable reducing agent than &beta;-mercaptoethanol)
(You need 150 &mu;L per sample.  This is enough for a 96 well plate.)

==Protocol==

[[Image:Knight96wellbetagalatosidaseassay.JPG|thumb|right|200px|96 well plate after completion of this assay.]]

#Grow cultures in tubes under whatever conditions you wish to test.
#*96 well plates did not give me as good of growth as tubes.
#*If growing in 96 well plates, use incubator in 32-322 because plate shaker in 32-314 doesn't hold the right temperature.
#During growth
##Make permeabilization solution.
##Pre-measure 80 &mu;L aliquots of permeabilization solution into a 96 well microplate and cover to reduce evaporation (permeabilization plate).
#Aliquot cultures into a 96 well microplate (175 &mu;L per well).
#Measure Abs<sub>600</sub> of cultures using plate reader (absorbance plate).
#Remove a 20 &mu;L aliquot of each well of the absorbance plate and add it to the corresponding well of the permeabilization plate.
#*The sample is now stable for several hours.  This allows you to perform time-course experiments.
#*Also include a blank (solutions-only) sample for subtracting the background absorbance later.
#Once the time course is nearly complete, make substrate solution.
#Add 150 &mu;L substrate solution to each well of measurement plate.
#Add 25 &mu;l of permeabilized samples to measurement plate.
#Place the plate in the plate reader to measure the A<sub>420</sub> over 60-90 mins.
#*The plate reader does not actually have a 420 excitation filter.  So you must use the CFP 430 excitation filter.

==Controls==
#Compare measured beta-galactosidase activity in plate reader versus that in microfuge tubes to ensure that the plate is not impacting measured &beta;-galactosidase activity.

==Standard curves==
#Make a standard curve in the plate reader of A<sub>420</sub> vs [[ONP|o-nitrophenol]] concentration using a two-fold serial dilution of ONP.
#Make a standard curve in the plate reader of change in A<sub>420</sub> versus time as a function of &beta;-galactosidase concentration.
