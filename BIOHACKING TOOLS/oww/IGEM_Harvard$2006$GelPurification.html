==Gel Purification==
*Pour a 8% acrylamide gel
**Prepare 120 mL of gel solution
***57.6 g urea (8M urea final concentration, MW 60)
***24 mL 40% acrylamide stock (19:1 acrlylamide:bisacrylamide, 8%  
final concentration)
***24 mL 5xTBE (1xTBE final concentration)
***700 uL 10% ammonium persulfate (APS)
***80 uL TEMED
**Prepare gel comb, plate and spacer assembly
**Pour gel into plate and spacer assembly
**Let polymerize
*Set up gel in gel electrophoresis apparatus, pour in 1xTBE
*Resuspend oligos in 300 uL TE
*Take 150 uL, add 150 uL 2xGLB (containing urea)
*Incubate for 3 minutes in a ~50C water bath
*Run at 180 volts for 1 hour
*Disassemble plates
*Place gel on plastic wrap
*Place white sheet of paper underneath plastic wrap
*Cut out bands illuminated by a handheld UV transilluminator,  
preferably at longer wavelength
*Add 2 mL crush and soak buffer
*Rotate on 37C shaker overnight
*Recover supernatant into two x 1mL eppendorf tubes
*[[Shih Lab Operation of Speedvac|Speedvac]] down to ~300 uL (approx.  
5 hours)
**If one speedvacs below 300 uL, then add water back to ~300 uL
*Add 900 uL ethanol to each tube and invert six times gently
*Incubate at -20C for 30 minutes
*Spin 16100 rcf 20 minutes at 4 C
*Decant supernatant
*Spin tubes briefly in microfuge to collect liquid on the bottom of  
the tube
*Pipette out remaining liquid
*Add 500 uL 75% ethanol, gently invert tube six times
*Spin tubes 16100 rcf 2 minutes at 4 C
*Remove the supernatant with pipettor
*Repeat 75% ethanol wash
*Speedvac tubes for five minutes
*Add 100 uL TE to each tube
*Incubate at room temperature for ten minutes
*Combine the two 100 uL into 200 uL
*Measure A260 and A280 for 4 uL DNA + 76 uL TE
**Use 80 uL TE as a blank
*Calculate concentration of DNA using [http://paris.chem.yale.edu/ 
extinct.html| biopolymer calculator]
*Add 190 uL DNA + calculated volume of TE to bring the concentration  
to the desired level (e.g. 10 uM or 20 uM)
