The number will be a US landline that you will need to call (which I will give you).

Or follow instructions for calling the mobile number in my last mail and I will reimburse you in January.

== How to take part in BioSysBio Teleconference? ==


We usually organize our teleconference using the free conference services (eg: conferenceuk.com). It’s quite easy to take part in the conference.

We have an orgaizer (John or Parthi or Manuel) who registers the details of parcipants with the free conference service. An invitation is automatically sent to your email address with all details related to partipating in the teleconference.

You may have to dial a telephone number (usually in UK OR in your own country). As per the details provided by the automated voice, you’ll have to dial the '''access code''' (sent with your invitation). Then, you have to announce yourselves as soon as you enter and ask for other participants.

In your invitation, you’ll get:

* The dial-in number & access code
