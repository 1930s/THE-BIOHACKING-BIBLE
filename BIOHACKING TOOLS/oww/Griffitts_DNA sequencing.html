{{Griffitts}}
==DNA Prep==
* Make a 1:10 dilution of each of your primers
** 3 μL primer + 27 μL ddH<sub>2</sub>0 will usually suffice
* Label your tubes
** Use 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
* Add 1 μL of the appropriate primer to each tube
* Add 9 μL DNA from a [[Griffitts:PCR_clean-up|cleaned up]] [[Griffitts:TaqPCR|PCR]]
** Each sequence will require two samples&mdash;one with the upstream primer and one with the downstream primer
* Report your sequencing reactions to Dr. Griffitts or [http://dnasc.byu.edu/ online]
* Take your sequencing reactions to 690 WIDB and put them in the refrigerator
** Make sure the liquid is at the bottom of the tube
