==2-4pm Meeting with Prof. Freemont and Dr Mann==

===Validation of & discussion about pending test constructs===

*Part J37016 (predator cell test construct):
**Modelling: Justification of Michaelis-Menten Kinetics
**Find binding constant for binding curve

*Part J37022 (aiiA test construct):
**Do the tags have any influence on activity of enzyme?
**Look up 3D structure of enzyme (protein databank)
***Find out about active sites etc. in order to decide on where to place the degradation tag
**Regarding the half-life of aiiA
***Better to test both ways with inserting IPTG and after washing out IPTG

*Part J37015 (prey cell test construct):
**CRE Recominases
***Cleavage of DNA -> New joint DNA -> Transcription of cleaved DNA (difficult to achieve in eukaryotes but possible in prokaryotes)

*Biosensor:
**AHL with radioactive label ?

==Update on Meeting==
The 3D structure of AiiA would suggest that it will be possible to insert on either end of the enzyme without hidering the active site.  [http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/figsonly/102/49/17606 This paper by Kim et al.] shows graphical models of AiiA which suggest this. [[User:Johnsy|Johnsy]]
