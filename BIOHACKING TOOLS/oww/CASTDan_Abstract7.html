Abstract

<p>A new oxygen analyzer combining a polymer-encapsulated dualemission
probe and a diode-based ratiometric fluorometer is described.
The ratiometric fluorometer was configured to measure the
relative fluorescence and phosphorescence intensity of the shortlived
singlet and long- lived oxygen-quenchable triplet of
[(dppe)Pt{S2C2(CH2CH2-N- 2-pyridinium)}](BPh4), where dppe is
1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane. This luminescent dye was immobilized
at 0.3% by weight in cellulose acetate/75% triethylcitrate
and cast into a 0.5 mm-thick film. The dye molecule was excited
with a blue light-emitting diode (LED) and the singlet and triplet
emissions monitored by individual photodiodes at 570 and 680 nm,
respectively. Oxygen can be accurately measured without interference
from nonanalyte-induced intensity changes by monitoring the
relative output of the two photodiodes. The output of the device was
linear with oxygen concentration. The PO2(1/2) from the ratioadapted
Stern± Volmer plot was 9.6% oxygen ( ~73 torr), offering a
dynamic range of 0± 90% O2. The device is stable and the oxygen
measurements reproducible. Intentional photobleaching of ~ 20%
of the sensor dye had little effect upon the reproducibility of the
oxygen measurements. </p>
