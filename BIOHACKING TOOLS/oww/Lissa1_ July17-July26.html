#Call our friend Jake (ext 122) and get some Luminol. -DONE, but no luminol
#Learn how to use fluorescence microscope to look at induced cells
#Learn exactly what is in ACL's strains
##Set up overnight of the appropriate strain with pGEV in it, and the parent strain
#Learn how to do phenol DNA extraction
#Cut, transfer, overnight incubation of noc. arrest gel, best done in PM -DONE
#Start to set up model of PPL system on paper -DONE
# Research ways to debug Pptase gel -DONE
##Add buffer to CIP reaction? -GOOD IDEA
##Increase amount of PPTase? -?
##Try another PPtase? -THIS SHOULD WORK
###Look at NEB catalog - Calbio has really nice phosphatases
###Look at other papers that have done Pptase -DONE

==Tuesday, July 25 ==
#Wash and image Western blot -DONE
#Phenol DNA extraction -DONE
#Set up PCR of extracted DNA with the forward and reverse primers I ordered-DONE
##Also try integration verification primers from previous pGEV integration attempts. -DONE
#ImageQuant -MOVED because people were using the computer by the typhoon
#Transform SSY403GHC into pGEV strain and parent strain (starting from beginning of EZ trans)- by the time I got around to this part, my cultures had overgrown for a second time (they had overgrown while I was doing the Phenol DNA extraction) and I couldn't prepare the competent cells.  I'll have to do this some other day.  
#Make freezer stock of Alejandro's strains. - equal parts yeast and glycerol, slow freeze -DONE
#Size comparison of Kss1 and Fus3. Does it make sense to run them on a SUMO gel? -DONE, no
