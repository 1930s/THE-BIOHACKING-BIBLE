== Feasibility Criteria ==

=== Level 1 ===
* Application driven
* Sources of knowledge / research
* reuse old knowledge
* novel, no overlap with other iGEMs
* project must be approves (Ethics, Safety)
* scope - needs to be functional in 9 weeks

=== Level 2 ===
* Application has to be low cost
* has to be portable
* safe, no contamination
* inspire confidence in synthetic biology
* must have a contingency
* use parts in registry
* no heavy metals
* no human testing
* no quantum shift (big change)
* keep to the status quo
* base on a commercialised product
* budget
* equipment
=== Level 3 ===
* based on reliable, basic parts
* max 3 components
* well documented
* easily modelled
* limited to college grounds
* restricted booking
* easy learning curve

=== Level 4 ===
* well characterised biobricks and chassis
* use PoPS

=== Criterion 1: Project Must Be Application driven ===
** Application has to be low cost
**has to be portable
**safe, no contamination
**inspire confidence in synthetic biology
**must have a contingency
=== Criterion 2: Project Must Generate Research===
** HRP
*** information processing
**** sensors
**** cleanup
** must generate data and analysis
** must generate documentation

=== Criterion 3: Project Must Reuse Available Sources of Knowledge ===
** Literature must be available

focus on engineering not science

make something work well - performance.

no exotic protocol requirements
