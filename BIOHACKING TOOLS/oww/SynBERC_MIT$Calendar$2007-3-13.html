Anyone in the synthetic biology community is welcome to attend.

Tuesday at 12pm

32-G449, MIT

==Topic of discussion==
We will be having a roundtable discussion on applications.  What are the key applications that are a) useful b) achievable in 3-5 years with a small team of folks and c) demonstrate the utility of synthetic biology approaches. (note: the following is an incomplete record of the points discussed.)

===Safety===
* detection
** PCR-based assays
* preventing replication
** terminator seeds
* preventing mutation
* preventing horizontal gene transfer
** restriction/methylation
** codon usage (re.coli)

===Research tools===
* pulse-generator
* oscillator
** adjustable frequency / amplitude

===Medical diagnostics===
* use antibodies within microbes
** leverage existing diversity of antibodies
** MIT igem05 team explored FecA transmembrane protein

===Environmental sensors===
* engineered microorganisms as sensors for chemicals / other pathogens in the sewer system
** if distributed could be cheap, robust epidemiological sensing network, monitor health of community
** water-treatment plants could be gateway to rolling out system
** [http://www.toto.co.jp/en/abstract/today/200205/today8.htm Toto] produces individual toilets that do some kind of analysis
** How could such a working microorganism sensor network, distributed through sewers, be assayed on a meaningful timescale in an efficient manner?
*** biological reporters -> electronic signals (m. simpson, oakridge)

===BioRemediation===
* oil breakdown in oceans
* activated sludge

==Remote participation==
*'''[[User:Rshetty|Reshma]] 09:59, 12 March 2007 (EDT)''': We're still playing around with enabling remote participation in our lunches.  Please bear with us as we try this out.  I am not sure how well audio is captured ... especially the comments of people in the audience so we are still playing with this.

===Video===
'''Update''': the "always-on" streams seem to be off.  I'll follow up with mark about this. If anyone is actually out there and wanting to participate, I can establish a 2-way ichat or skype videoconference or a 1-way quicktime stream from my laptop right now; let me know in the chat page.([[User:Macowell|Mac Cowell]] 12:15, 13 March 2007 (EDT))

Mark Pearrow of CSAIL TIG has set up Kiva with essentially always-on media streams of a '''webcam in the back of the room''' and the video of anything connected to '''vga port 1'''.  Additionally, audio is captured from a lapel mike stored in the cabinet at the back of the room (on which the webcam is perched).  Mark recommends using VLC to connect to the two streams:

 http://xibalba.csail.mit.edu:8080 (main camera/speaker)
 http://xibalba.csail.mit.edu:8081 (slides from laptop input 1)

VLC on Mac OS X cannot open two media streams simultaneously, so Mark suggests making a duplicate copy of the VLC application with a name like 'VLC 2' and using it to connect to the second stream.

===Chat===
To submit questions and comments live during the lunch, visit [http://openwetware.org/wiki/Special:Chat/SynBERC:MIT/Calendar/2007-3-13 the chat room] and type in that window.  (You need an [[Join|OpenWetWare account]] and you need to enable chat in your preferences (top right hand side of browser window.)   We'll have a laptop open to the chat room during the lunch (eventually we might simulcast this on a screen).
