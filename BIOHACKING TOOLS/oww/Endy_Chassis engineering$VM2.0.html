#Stability
#*Noise
#**analytical stability analysis on very simple model or Routh-Hurwitz analysis for full model
#**parameter sensitivity analysis
#*Response time
#**Better to have this fast or slow (slow response time averages out short time scale fluctuations)
#Self-booting/controlled
#*Ability to turn on or off
#*Portability
#Tunable
#*Pros and cons of DNA copy number, promoter strength, repressor affinities etc.
#Efficient
#*Minimizing levels of repressor needed
#*Minimizing consumption of small molecules

What are the metrics for each of the design considerations?

==Reduced Model==

*Two species, RNAP (activator) and repressor
*Continuous differential equations
*MATLAB
*Dimensionless variables, lumped parameters.
*Parameterized for T7 RNAP, "typical" repressor
<br>
<math>
\dot{[u]} = \frac{a_{0}+a_{1}[u]}{1+[u]+[v]^{n}}-[u]\qquad(1)
</math>
<br>
<math>
\dot{[v]} = \frac{b_{0}+b_{1}[u]}{1+[u]+[v]^{n}}-[v]\qquad(2)
</math>
<br>

<math>\displaystyle [u]</math> = dimensionless concentration of T7 RNAP
<br>

<math>\displaystyle [v]</math> = dimensionless concentration of repressor
<br>
<br style="clear:both" />

If I assume that the two species are expressed in a constant ratio (i.e polycistronic expression or under promoters of proportional strength and have similar degradation rates) then the two equations can be reduced to one - 

<math>
\dot{[u]} = \frac{a_{0}+a_{1}[u]}{1+[u]+r[u]^{n}}-[u]\qquad(3)
</math>



===Big questions to answer===
#What are the steady state levels of RNAP/Repressor as a function of parameters?
#*Setting the LHS of Equation 3 to 0 and solving for the steady state level, <math>\displaystyle u_{ss}</math> with <math>\scriptstyle n=2</math> and ignoring small terms, the (single) fixed point, is <math>u_{ss} = \frac{\sqrt{a_{1}}}{r}</math>
#What is the material usage like?
#What happens when RNAP level drops suddenly (e.g. when another T7 reporter in the cell is derepressed.)

===Model analysis notes===
*A cooperative autogene network can exhibit bistability or monostability depending on parameter values ([http://web.mit.edu/biophysics/sbio/ 7.81]).  Does this apply if there is no cooperativity?
