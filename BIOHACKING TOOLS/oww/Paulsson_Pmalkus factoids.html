===wish I knew===
* radius of photobleached area (when acquiring Matrix of images on scope, how far apart should frames be?)
* how fast can you spin coli without losing cfu? stationary vs. log phase growth
* percent of MFG-GFP fusions that are non-functional (eg in S.c. ORFeome collection)???  Partial loss of function may not be detected in viability, but rather in growth rate or protein localization?
* coli transcriptional/proteome resources

===FPs===
* in vivo maturation of Venus ~7 -/+ 2.5 min (Yu and Xie, Science'06)
* homoaffinity of purified recombinant YFP, K(d) = 0.11mM (Zacharias et al., Science v296:913-916, 2002)

* degradation of GFP-LAA: in vivo???  in vitro <5min (Bukau, Sue Wickner)
* degradation of N-end rule substrate ~2min (Varshavsky Science'91)

===coli===
*don't prewarm Amp plates at 37deg for more than ~ 30min (otherwise satellites will appear)

*E. coli doubling times
strain W1485: 46.9' at 28deg, 24.1' at 37deg, 21.4' at 42deg (Condon and Squires, J.Bact 1995)<br>

*supplementing minimal media with 0.1% casamino acids attenuates GFP toxicity (Alper and Stephanopoulos, PNAS'05)

*Compared to closed circular dsDNA, nicked circular DNA and ssDNA are 50% as efficient, linear DNA is 0.1% as efficient in transformation of E. coli.

===lab strains===
*The plasmid in ST11 and ST12 (and all pPM derivatives) have an A to G mutation in the PLtet-O1 promoter (at position 1982 in pPM5).  This substitution doesn't appear to alter behavior of Ptet, but I haven't done the direct comparison to original PLtet-O1.

*PMB14 and 27 both contain integrated version of LacI AND TetR.  They work equally well at repressing Plac and Ptet.
