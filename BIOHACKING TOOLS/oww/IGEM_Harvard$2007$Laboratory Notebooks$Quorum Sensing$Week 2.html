==== Transformation of Parts into Top10 ====
See [[IGEM:Harvard/2007/Protocols#Transformation|Perry's Transformation Protocol]], transforming the parts [[F1610]], [[I13263]], and [[I13272]] into Top10 cells

==== Plating of Top10 cells containing the parts====
We plated the three parts onto three separate petri dishes.

==== Growth of colonies in liquid cultures ====
We grew a large amount because we want to carry out a midiprep tomorrow 
#Take 3 500 mL flasks from the cabinet in the big room with the house on the chalkboard and the person saying "Yaye" 
#Put 150 mL of LB and 150 ÂµL of ampicillin (all the parts are ampicillin resistant) into each flask
#Put into the agitating incubator overnight

==== Midiprep with the liquid cultures grown on 6/26====
See [[IGEM:Harvard/2007/Protocols/HiSpeed Midi and Maxi Prep|HiSpeed Midi and Maxi Prep]] for protocol used

==== Transformation of I13263 into BL21 ====
See [[IGEM:Harvard/2007/week_1#Transformation_protocol|Transformation Protocol]] for the protocol used. 

==== Sequencing the I13263 ====
See [[IGEM:Harvard/2007/week_2#Sequencing_DNA|Sequencing Protocol]] for the protocol used.

==== F1610 Checks ====
*F1610 Digestion Part I
**[[User:GeorgeXu#Transformation_of_Additional_Parts|George's Noteboook Entry]]
**Perry and George digested the F1610 with XbaI and PstI.
* Clonewell
**F1610 is about 800 bp, there were no visible bands in that region. There is something wrong.
* F1610 Digestion Part II (more DNA)
**[[User:GeorgeXu#Digestion_of_F1610:_Part_Two}|George's Notebook Entry]]
**Stephanie ran the same digestion on the F1610 except with more DNA.
==== Growing Liquid Cultures of I13263 ====
Stephanie and George grew liquid cultures of I13263 in preparation for the FACS appointment.

==== Sequences of F1610, I13263, I13272 ====
[[User:GeorgeXu#Digestion_of_F1610:_Part_Two|George's Noteboook Entry]]

Perry checked the Genewiz sequencing results for the F1610, I13263, and I13272. The results for F1610 were not good, excellent for I13263, and for I13273.

==== Transformation of Additional Parts ====

====FACS appointment====
We diluted and grew the overnight samples to log phase (in a very sketchy manner) and induced the samples with  1, 10, and 100 nM HSL 1, 2, and 4 hours before the FACS appointment. 

The results were disappointing. We didn't have any detectable fluorescence in any of the samples.

====Miniprepping R0011, B0015, T9002====
Stephanie miniprepped all the parts mentioned in the previous section. Unfortunately, the labels for R0011, B0015, and T9002 smeared so she ran an E-gel to distinguish between the three.

====E-gel results====
Stephanie and Perry looked at the results of the E-gel to distinguish between the three samples.
