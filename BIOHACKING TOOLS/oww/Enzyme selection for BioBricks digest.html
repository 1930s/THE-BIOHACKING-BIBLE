'''A BioBricks part:'''

*-----E--X---Part---S--P-----

Vector with upstream part - S,P

Downstream Insert - X,P

Upstream Insert - E,S

Vector with downstream part- E,X




E= EcoRI
X= XbaI
S= SpeI
P= PstI

==Notes== 
Very small (<100kb) inserts have shown to be difficult to remove from a gel purification.  It is recommended that during assembly very small pieces be kept on the vector and larger pieces be used as inserts if possible.
