==Debrief (Meeting with Professor Kitney)==

===Infector Detector===
'''Comments'''
*This application is a big leap forward for the medical field.
**If we perfect this application, we will be able to put it on every catheter.
*Think about the packaging of the system
*Does the in vitro system really give us the edge over the applications in the field of synthetic biology?
*How do we add LuxR (packaging)
*For the Jamboree presentation, take the audience through the research and application process step by step to make it easily digstible

'''In the lab'''
*Carry out this experiment in vivo and observe the edge it has over the in vitro application
*Is the DNA construc complicated enough?
*Define visible- DsRed Express and GFP; change the conditions ofobservation of the fluorescence produced
*How sensitive is the system?
*How long can the system bestored at e.g.4oC before usage?
*Problem with detection of low [AHL]
*How long can the system last? Can we optimize it?
*How stable is the fluorescent molecules?
*How robust is the system? e.g. temperature dependance, pressure dependant


===Cell By Date===
'''Comments'''
*Clarify experimental concept, and link it to meat spoilage
*Emphasize of DsRed Express as the reporter
*Think about the packaging of the product e.g. sticker form? in the cling film?
*Might have to look for another application other than meat spoilage , if construct does not fit the temperature range well 

'''In the lab'''
*Place the device in a real scenario and observe how it works
*Find out the lag time of the system i.e. how long would DsRed Express take to reach visible threshold
*Construct does notfit the temperature range very well
**Look into cryophilic bacteria, which has the appropriate cellular machinery to generate proteins at the temperature range of 0oC -5oC
*Look at improving the sensitivity (lag time) of the system
*Look into making new construct for pT7 as a biobrick from the current version we have so that we can swap bricks around later


===Vesicles===
'''Comments'''
*It is a new chassis
*If the pores used are toxic, should they be placed on the catheter?
*For the presentation, link this with the 2 applications
*Want to see the engineering cycle implemented into our project
*It is not essential to the main project, but serves as "icing on the cake"
*Less manpower should be devoted to it (reduce from 3 members)

'''In the lab'''
*It is very hard to calibrate fluoresence withinthe vesicle; if solution used is differet, vesicles would also behave differently
*It serves to increase the lifespan of the CBD application, but a strict control must be imposed on the quality


===PR===
*How do the 2 projects (applications) link together?
*Implement the engineerng cycle
*Sherlock Holmes theme is a good selling idea
