==Results from Antibiotic Tests==

'''R0040.E0840'''

SUCCESSFUL (grew on AMP and not on AT, AK, or AC)

'''osmYFN.inverter.E0840'''

SUCCESSFUL (grew on AK and not on AT or AC)

'''osmYSN.E0840'''

SUCCESSFUL (grew on AT and not on AK or AC)

'''B0015 (Control)'''

SUCCESSFUL (grew on AK and not on AT or AC)

'''Indole-Knockout cells'''

SUCCESSFUL (grew on C but not on A, T, or K, consistent with Yale's listing of the strain as Chloramphenicol resistant)

==Sequencing Results==

The osmY.inverter.J45119 structure from the fridge was correct along with all of the J45120s which passed the antibiotic test.  Thus, we will continue to use "J45120 A" as we used in the construction of a new J45700.  

All of the premade pBANANA structures had either bad results or failed sequencing.  The only thing we can say for sure is that one of the structures has J45400 in it.  I believe that our best bet is to continue with the J45600 and pBANANA structures I have constructed this past week since we were able to smell bananas in both structures.

*NOTE- The osmY.inverter.J45119 structure has the short version of the osmY promoter in it.  J45250 has the long version of osmY in it.  This was part of our original, optimistic plan to have less expression of mint, so that the banana smell could overpower residual methyl salicylate in stationary phase.  To make these versions match our fluorescent structures, I will retransform an osmY.E0840 full version today and digest osmY short and inverter.E0840 today to ligate and transform tomorrow.  Right now, we have osmY.E0840 short and osmY.inverter.E0840 long.
