[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tris Tris] is a common buffering agent and is short for tris[hydroxymethyl]aminomethane (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>11</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>).

* The formula weight is 121.14
* The pKa of Tris is 8.3
* dpK<sub>a</sub>/dT is -.028
* A buffer at pH 6.8 at 25&deg;C will have a pH of 6.46 at 37&deg;C
** Note that adding HCl during titration will affect the temperature of the solution
* Dilution by a factor of 10 will reduce the pH by 0.1 pH units.

== Preparing a 1M Tris, pH 7.4 solution, from [http://biologicalworld.com/trisbuffer.htm biologicalworld] ==
* Weigh 121.1 g Tris in 700 ml double distilled water
* Do not start with too much water; otherwise, the volume after pHing may be too great
* Start stirring, and then check the pH
* With a 3M HCl solution, start to pH the solution such that the pH reaches 7.4
(Be careful not to inhale the HCl.)
* Add with double distilled water up to 1L
* Filter or autoclave if necessary
* May be better to store at 4 degrees C
* Dilute to appropriate concentration for use in biochemistry or molecular biology experiments.  20 mM or 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4 solutions are common.
