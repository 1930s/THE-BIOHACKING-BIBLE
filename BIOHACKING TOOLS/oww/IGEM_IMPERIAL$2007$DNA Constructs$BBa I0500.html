==BBa I0500==
pBAD is activated by the AraC-arabinose complex.

This part is an "all-or-none" promoter. At sub-saturation levels of inducer, there is a heterogenous population of cells, where some cells are fully induced, while others are virtually non-induced. This is because inducer importers are turned on when exposed to inducer, resulting in positive feedback. Cells that switch on inducer importers first take up all the inducers present.
