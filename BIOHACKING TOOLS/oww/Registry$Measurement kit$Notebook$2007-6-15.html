==Plan for today==
#Digest constructs
#Ligate components
#Transform

==Double Digest==
*See [[Knight:Restriction Digest|protocol]]
*Used buffer 3 as suggested by NEB for the XbaI/PstI digests
*Used 2uL stock R0040 instead of prepped
*22.12 uL of B0032
*8.84 uL of I13401
*4.68 uL of J04650
*Incubated at 37 for 5 hrs

==Design discussion==
*Inserting a standard BioBrick site (...EcoRI-XbaI-[ccdB]-SpeI-PstI...) for the placement of an RBS would leave too big a gap between the RBS and translation initiator (http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Assembly:RBS-CDS_issues)
See proposed solution at [[Registry/Measurement_kit/Notebook/Design]]
*It was suggested that we use the LacZ reporter gene instead of an FP, but all that appears to be in the registry is an N-terminus fragment of the LacZ gene. In the near future, we plan to standardize and enter the LacZ gene into the registry.

==PCR purification==
*buffer transfer of cut DNA
*protocol is in booklet with the kit
*note: labeling system for digests:
#R0040
#B0032
#I13401
#J04650

==Ligation==
[[Endy:DNA_ligation_using_T4_DNA_ligase]]
*Used modified version of above protocol. Will post on OWW soon.

Labels:
A: RFP promoter tester
*B0032 + J04650
B: GFP RBS tester
*R0040 + I13401
C: RFP RBS tester
*R0040 + J0465

==Transformation of devices==
*Attempting to transform the ligated devices.
*Strain - MG1655
