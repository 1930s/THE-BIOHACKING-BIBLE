==Casting agarose gels==

We precast our gels.

===Materials===

*[[1X TAE]]
*SYBR safe (10,000X stock)
*Agarose
*Microwave
*Stir plate and stir bar (optional)

===Procedure===

#Add 300mL 1X TAE to a 500 mL bottle.
#Measure out sufficient agarose to cast either a 1% (3 g) or 1.5% (4.5 g) gel.
#Add the agarose to the TAE buffer in the 500 mL bottle.
#Swirl to mix.
#Microwave bottle with loosened cap on high until the gel starts to bubble and is transparent.  <br> ''This generally takes just over two minutes for 300 mL.  If you microwave too long, the gel will bubble over causing a big mess and you will need to start over.''
#Remove from microwave and let cool by either sitting on bench top or adding stir bar and placing on stir plate. <br> ''The advantage of the stir plate is that, if you forget about your gel for a while, it is less likely to solidify accidentally. <br> If you are in a hurry, you can place the bottle in a beaker of room temperature water on the stir plate to speed the cooling process significantly.''
#While gel is cooling, assemble casting trays and gel combs and verify that the trays are level.
#Once gel is cooled so that it can be touched comfortably with your gloved hand, add 30 &mu;L SYBR Safe (10,000X concentrate).
#Pour gel into casting trays. <br> ''The height of the gel will depend on how much you wish to load.  Diagnostic gels can be reasonably shallow since typically 10 &mu;L volumes are loaded.  For gel purifications, the gel should be deeper to enable loading of large sample volumes.''
#Let gels sit until they are solidified.  <br> ''Gels are solid when they are cloudy in appearance and firm to the touch.''
#Gels may be used immediately.  Alternatively, gels may be individually sealed in 6 x 10 inch polyethylene bags, labelled with initials, date and percentage and stored at 4 &deg;C.  <br> ''It is a judgement call as to whether a gel is too old to be used.  If it takes on a shrivelled appearance, don't use it.  If there is lots of condensation on the bag, only use it if your intended experiment isn't critical.''

==Running agarose gels==

===Materials===

*[[DNA ladder | Prepared DNA ladder]]
*Precast gel with the appropriate percentage and well size/numbers for your samples (see above)
*[[1X TAE]]
*[[Knight:Loading dye|Loading dye]]

===Procedure===

#Take a gel from the 4&deg;C fridge.  <br> ''If the number of gels is getting low, cast more gels as described above.''
#Place your gel in gel box.
#Add 1X TAE buffer to gel box such that buffer just covers the top of the gel.
#Remove comb.
#Load 12 &mu;L prepared ladder <br> ''Typically load ladder in left-most lane and sometimes right-most lane as well depending on whether you have the space.''
#Use 2 &mu;L loading dye per 10 &mu;L of sample.
#Load samples left to right. <br> ''The capacity of the 8 well, 1.5mm wide well is approximately 45 &mu;L.  The capacity of the 15 well, 1.5mm well is approximately 15 &mu;L.''
#Place gel box cover on gel box such that your samples will run towards the positive, red electrode.
#Run your gel at ~85 volts for 1 hr 20 mins.  Use the timer to enable automatic shutoff of your gel. <br> ''If you are in a hurry the gel can be run faster at ~95 volts for less than an hour.''
#Verify that bubbles are rising from the electrodes once you start your gel to ensure your gel is running properly.

==Visualizing agarose gels==

''Note that this procedure is under development''

===Materials===

*FluorChem 8800 gel imager

===Procedure===

#Remove gel from gel box shaking gently to allow residual buffer to fall back into gel box.
#Place in middle of UV box inside gel imager (you can leave the gel in gel tray).
#Make sure that filter wheel is set to position 4 (SYBR gold).
#Close the door and turn on reflective white light button.
#In gel imager software, click the "Acquire" button such that gel displays on screen.
#Adjust gel position on UV box so that the entire gel is within the frame.
#Close the door, turn off reflective white light and turn on transilluminating UV light.
#In gel imager software, click "Acquire image" button to capture gel image to the screen. <br> ''It is occasionally necessary to adjust exposure time to improved image.''
#Increase filtering if bands are difficult to see.
#Annotate gel as necessary.
#Save a copy of gel picture in your user folder.
#Print.
#Remove gel and throw in trash.
#Wipe down UV box if necessary.

==Interpreting results==

*If you are getting unexpected bands on your gel you may want to look at the [[Agarose gel electrophoresis/Common issues|common agarose gel issues]].

==Notes==

*We have replaced [[Ethidium Bromide]] with [http://probes.invitrogen.com/products/sybrsafe/ SYBR Safe DNA gel stain].  According to Reet Mand at Alpha Innotech Corp Technical Support: For SybrSafe dye, we recommend Fluorescein filter which is centered at 535nm. The part number is FLSC-500 and you can order it from us.  Tom says this is the same as the SYBR-Gold filter installed in position 4 of the filter wheel.
