==Overview==
A Western Blot allows for the semiquantitative determination of protein expression.
Crude cell lysates are loaded into a polyacrylamide gel containing a denaturing agent which give all the proteins a net negative charge. A current can then be passed through the gel and the proteins will migrate through the gel, with the largest proteins traveling the slowest, resulting in a lane where proteins become separated on the basis of their weight. The proteins can then be transferred from the gel onto a membrane (often nitrocellulose or PVDF), which can then by incubated with an antibody directed against the protein of interest. By using a detector conjugated to an antibody one can now detect specifically the protein of interest.
