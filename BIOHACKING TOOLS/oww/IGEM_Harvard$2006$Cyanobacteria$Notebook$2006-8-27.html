== Glycerol stock and inoculation of Nick's 22.8 J04500 + KaiB ligation ==
We reviewed Nick's colony PCR and discovered that one colony appeared to contain a successful J04500 + KaiB ligation (22.8 #3). We made glycerol stocks of the 3 22.8 colonies, and inoculated new cultures for all 3 (5 mL LB Kan).

We worked on our final presentation for tomorrow (see [[IGEM:Harvard/2006/Cyanobacteria#Presentations|front cyano page]]).
