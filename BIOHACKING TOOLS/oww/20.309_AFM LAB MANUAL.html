==Objectives and Learning Goals== 

*Learn the function of the 20.309 AFM and the relationships between its components.
*Understand how to extract quantitative information from this tool.
*Use the AFM to take images, probe sample stiffness, and estimate the value of a fundamental physical constant.
*Analyze the sources of uncertainty and noise in the system that limit the accuracy of measurements.

==Roadmap and Milestones==

The AFM will be the basis of three weeks' worth of experiments, and
the roadmap below is subdivided into weeks to help you gauge your
progress.

===Week 1===
# Learn the signal paths and connections of the system.
# Practice aligning the AFM optics.
# Learn how to calibrate the AFM to extract useful physical data.
# Measure the vibrational noise floor in the AFM system.
# Set up and prepare the AFM for imaging.

===Week 2===
# Image several different samples with the AFM and measure the physical dimensions of imaged features (Experimment 1).
# Use the AFM to measure the elastic modulus and surface adhesion force of several different samples (Experiment 2).

===Week 3===
# Use your knowledge of the AFM system and associated instrumentation to record the vibrational noise spectrum of a cantilever probe (Experiment 3).
# Calculate the value of Boltzmann's Constant Kbfrom the vibrational spectrum.
