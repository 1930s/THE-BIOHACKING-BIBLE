==Overview==
This assay permits testing of specific binding of proteins to DNA fragments.  DNA that is bound to protein will migrate slower in a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel than unbound DNA during electrophoresis.

Most protocols rely on <sup>32</sup>P labelling of the DNA fragment.  However, it is also possible to detect the DNA via nonradioactive detection methods (like fluorescence).  Ethidium bromide staining is generally not sensitive enough since usually small amounts of DNA are used in this assay.

#*primary advantage is that this protocol doesn't require use of radioactivity or prelabelling of DNA, sensitivity is questionable however
