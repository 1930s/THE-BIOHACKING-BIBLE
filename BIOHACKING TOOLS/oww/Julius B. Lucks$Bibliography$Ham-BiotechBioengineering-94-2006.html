* fim inversion in E. coli - unidirectional switch
* expression system - arabinose inducible fimE, and fim invertible DNA segment containing constitutively active promoter
*# target gene has promoter in OFF orientation (no transcribed product)
*# add arabinose, fimE flips DNA sequence, turning promoter in ON position causing transcription of target gene
** tightly controlled basal expression, highly inducible
*** large scale expression of toxic proteins
* Other inducible systems
** IPTG induced trc (P_trc)
** arabinose induced araBAD (P_BAD)
* '''Podhajska 1985 - inversion-based expression system using lambda Int and attP/attB''' <cite>Podhajska-Gene-40-1985</cite>
** tight control when not intuced, and high induction level when induced - (Sektas, 2001)
** requires heat-shock induction mechanism
* type I fimbrae in E. coli has phase variation
** due to inversion of 314-bp segment containing promoter of fimA by invertases FimB and FimE (Klemm, 1986)
*** FimB inverts both directions, FimE inverts preferrentially ON to OFF
** invertases bind to non-identical inverted repeats surrounding invertible DNA segment
* ''''sequences between promoter and RBS could form mRNA secondary structures that could aversly affect expression'''' - (de Smit and van Duin 1994, Pfleger 2005)
* arabinose induces once to start gene expression - no need for extra inducer - can use a pulse of arabinose

* flipase memory system
* diagram attP/B push system
