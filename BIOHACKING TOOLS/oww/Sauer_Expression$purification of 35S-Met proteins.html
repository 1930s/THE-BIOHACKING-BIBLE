*In general, the Sauer lab only radiolabels His<sub>6</sub>-tagged proteins because they are easy to purify without getting radiation all over the place. If necessary, however, other methods of purification can be employed, but it is recommended that gravity columns be used versus an FPLC-type system in order to reduce the spread of radiation.
