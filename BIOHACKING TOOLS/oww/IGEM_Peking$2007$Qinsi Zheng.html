*Hi, I am Qinsi. I am an undergraduate student in department of chemistry, Peking University. Currently I am interested in biology and  open source. Please feel free to contact me by e-mail: '''qinsi.zheng AT gmail DOT com'''
*Before the competition I am not a biologist at all, I just thought Synthetic Biology is cool, so I joined it. I need to learn a lot, but I think it is not so difficult. Here I encourage non-biological stidents to join iGEM. It is fun, cool, promising and not too difficult, but of course you should love it and work hard on it :-)
