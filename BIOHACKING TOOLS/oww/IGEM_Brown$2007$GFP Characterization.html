GFP
GFPmut3 (Part No: BBa_E0040):
Half-life > 1 day (the length of the experiment).  It was still expressed after 192 hours.
Time to expression = 8 min (this may or may not be the same for other variants of GFP).
 This is the common GFP that is in most projects.
BBa_J52028:
Half-life = 2 hours.  Shorter half-life because an extra piece was added to the protein called Pest that causes it to degrade faster.
Others:
Other types of GFP have been engineered to last between 40 minutes to many hours.  Other types of GFP taken from a paper (which may or may not be on iGEM):

Skim this paper to find out about a bunch of other GFP variants that have specific degradation rates. 

*Note
To find parts, the way that worked so far for me was to go here: http://parts.mit.edu/r/parts/partsdb/search.cgi and search for “gfp.”  It will come up with TONS of results but you can sift through them and find what you’re looking for.
