#REsuspend in 1 mL EZ 2 Solution
#SLOWLY freeze (in styrofoam container) in -80 freezer.

'''Transformation'''
#Mix 50 uL competent cells with .2-1 ug DNA, add 500 uL EZ 3 solution and mix.
#Incubate at 30 C for 45 minutes.  Mix by flicking every 15 mins or so.
#Spread 50-150 uL of transformation on your plate.
