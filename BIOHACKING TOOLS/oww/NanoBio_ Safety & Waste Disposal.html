==Safety==
===Safety Everyday===
* Put on safety glasses every time you step into the lab.
* If you are working in the lab, in addition to safety glasses - you should be wearing:
** a lab coat
** closed-toe shoes (not sandals)
** gloves
* When you're done in the lab:
** leave your lab coat in the lab
** dispose of your gloves in the biohazardous or solid waste, as appropriate
** wash your hands!
* Think about potential hazardous before you start an experiment - especially it is the first time you're doing it.
* If you're unsure whether part of a procedure you're about to do might be hazardous, get advice! Ask a local expert (Michael & Melike are a good place to start) and get an answer you're comfortable with, BEFORE you start.

===DUH's===
*Don't eat or drink in lab.
*Don't pipet by mouth.
