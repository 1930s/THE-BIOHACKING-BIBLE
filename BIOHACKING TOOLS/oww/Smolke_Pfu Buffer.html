==Summary==

10x buffer for PCR with Pfu. Makes 10mL.

==Ingredients==

*2 mL 1M Tris-HCl pH 8.8
*333 &mu;L 3M KCl
*500 &mu;L 20% Triton X-100
*1 mL 100x BSA
*200 &mu;L 1M MgSO<sub>4</sub>
*5.967 mL H<sub>2</sub>O

==Protocol==
#Mix, vortex.
#Store at -20&deg;C

==Notes==
*We couldn't find any Triton X-100 in the lab. Our best guess is that NP-40 was (previously) used instead. -[[User:Jkm|Jkm]] 18:18, 2 August 2006 (EDT)
*Should be supplemented with MgCl<sub>2</sub> when used. A working concentration of 2.5mM (a 1/20 dilution of 50mM stock) works for most applications.
