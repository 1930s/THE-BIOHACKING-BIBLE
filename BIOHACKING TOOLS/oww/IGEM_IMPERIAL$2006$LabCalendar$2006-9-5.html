 <u>'''TO DO:'''</u>
 *Testing of J37016, S01656
 *Finish ligation for J37022 & electroporate (has it been finished yesterday?)
 *Finish ligation for Dr. Frays aiiA into the T hanging plasmid & electroporate
 *Culture J37036 & J37018 from plate in incubator for maxi & mini on Wednesday
 *Culture T9002 from plate in incubator for new testing & making frozen stocks

==Western Blot==

*There was no discernable difference in the proteins produced by the induced and non-induced cells
*This indicates that there is something wrong with the mechanism involving S01656 expression, possibly its promoter
*This does not however mean that the aiiA is wrong necessarily - testing of J37022 should clarify this.

==Testing of S01656==
*Was started with the revised protocol but after results from Western Blot came out, was abandonded
*Is not going to be tested any more since no protein seems to be transcribed at all

==AiiA Ligation/electroporation==
*Samples run on gel and adequate bands cut out.
*Glass milk purified and ligated into T9 overhanging vector 
*Forms New J37023
*Electroporated in the afternoon
<br>

==LoxP PCR== 

* The small PCR fragment is not being amplified

==Testing S01656 & J37016==

*Testing was not conducted as western blot indicates that there may be something wrong with the S01656 expression mechanism. 
*J37016 was being cultured for the S01656 testing. This test, too, was not finished since we are no longer carrying out testing of S01656. We have 3 good sets of data for J37016 so far.
