'''Welcome to 20.020!''' A project-based introduction to the engineering of synthetic biological systems.  In this subject, you will have an opportunity to develop projects that are responsive to real-world problems, using solutions that depend on biological technologies. Through interactive lectures and studio time, you will be introduced to 
*'''(1)''' components and control of cellular behavior, in particular energy, modularity and heredity through time and space
*'''(2)''' DNA synthesis, standards, and abstraction in biological engineering <br>
*'''(3)''' issues of human practice, including (a) biological safety, (b)security, (c) ownership, sharing, & innovation, and (d) ethics <br>We hope this subject will provide an engaging introduction for would-be biological engineers as well as a foundational framework for anyone interested in the responsible and reliable programming of genetic material.
