==12D->2H==
*The gel that was run yesterday was inconclusive as to whether the DNA has the problem or the enzyme.  
*We will run 7A using the same procedure to see if it is cutting the plamid at all.  We are again using the same enzymes with yellow buffer
*SpeI & PstI were able to successfully cut 7A, so it is not a problem with the enzyme!
*We will try re-electroporating part 2H again using the DNA from the parts registry to see if we can get it to work tomorrow

==Reculture J37016==
**Plates were quite good and we managed to isolate single colonies
*We took a total of 4 cultures to miniprep tomorrow or later this afternoon to see if we get what we expect.

==Ligation of 6B+RS+12D+24A==
*The insert and vector were removed from the overnight gel 
*20 uL ligation performed

==Electroporations==
*J37015RS (6B->RS->12D->24A)
*1M B0021 removed from iGEM plate
*4G S01656 removed from iGEM plate 2, grown on kanamycin plate
*2H I13033 re-electroporated to see if the SpeI site has mutated on the gene
*Didn't bother with adding LB, since we only have LB Amp and no Kanamycin.  So just plated the electrocompetent cells straight onto plate.  Hopefully this doesn't affect growth.

==Set up Maxipreps==
*6B F2620 (ran out of maxiprep)
*1I B0015 (remaxiprep, since whereabouts of previous maxiprep unknown)

==To do tomorrow==
*Maxiprep parts above
*Reculture the electoporations into liquid media
*Ligate 1I and 9G to make part 2H, in case 2H fails yet again
*Miniprep the parts from electroporation, if possible
*Miniprep J37016 which is currently in shaker since 11 am Wednesday
