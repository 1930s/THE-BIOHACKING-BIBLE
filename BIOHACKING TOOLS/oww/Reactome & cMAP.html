This presentation from the Bio[[MIBLab]] [[Summer 2006 Workshop]] is an [[Summer 2006 Workshop#Imaging|imaging]] bioinformatics tool.  

This presentation includes a comparison of the features of two bioinformatics tools, Reactome and cMAP.

==Synopsis==
;Reactome
:Curated resource of core pathways and reactions in human biology and 21 non-human species.

;cMAP
:A prototype system to access and link molecular profiles, molecular targets, targeted agents, and clinical data.

==Features==
;Reactome 
*Data model / Schema
:consists of pathways, reactions, entities
*Search / Extended search
:links to external references
*Pathfinder
:finds pathways linked with input/output compounds
*Skypainter
:identifies significant events linked with genes
*Downloads
:manage local versions
*Editorial calendar
:lists planned updates, curation information
;cMAP
*Context
:defines tissue and histology types
*Molecular profiles
:displays expression ratios spatially in chromosomal and 2D array formats
*Molecular targets
:organizes gene targets based on:
::ontology (GO)
::pathways (BioCARTA)
::CMAP annotated pathways 
*Targeted agents
:found in CTEP, CMAP trials
*Clinical trials
