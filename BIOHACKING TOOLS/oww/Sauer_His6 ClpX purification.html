===Materials Needed===

*1000x AMP: 100mg/mL in 70% Ethanol
*2 x 1L TB
*1M ZnSO4
*1M IPTG
*His-tagged ClpX strain: SJ01
*LB

===Protocol===

====Day One====
 
*1.	Innoculate 25mL of LB-AMP with His-tagged ClpX strain.

*2.	Warn 2x 1L of TB in incubator or warm room at 37 overnight

====Day Two====

*1.	Add 1mL of 1000x AMP to each of the TB Flasks.

*2.	Innoculate each flask with 10mL of overnight culture

*3.	Grow at 37 C until OD is ~1-1.2 (should take ~>3hrs.)

*4.	Drop temperature of incubator to <RT

*5.	Add 15uL of ZnSO4

*6.	At OD of 1.7-2.0, induce with 0.25mM IPTG (250uL). Make sure flask is cooled to RT)

*7.	After 2-3 hrs. move to bottles and spin down in J6 at 4K/

*8.	Decant Supernatant. Immediately Freeze at -80

==Purification==

===Purification===

*1. Thaw with lysis buffer. Remember to add protease inhibitor.
*2. Lyse via method of your choice
*3. Spin down 50m. at 15k rpm
====Ni-NTA====
*4. Incubate supernatant with prewashed Ni-NTA slurry for ~30m to 1hr.
*5. Pour into column. Wash with ~20mL NiNTA wash buffer.
*6. Elute with ~15mL N.E. buffer, collecting 1mL fractions
*7. Identify best fractions by Bradford Assay
*8. Pool best fractions, buffer exchange (PD10) into Q loading buffer.
====MonoQ====
*9. MonoQ Column, 20 min. (or longer) gradient to 100% Q Elution.
*10. Concentrate as needed. Buffer exchange into Clp buffer
*11. Store at -80
