===Meta===
*TGF-B (sticky) -> SMCs differentiate
*PDGF-BB (not sticky) -> recruit SMC progenitors associate with endothelial cells -> cleaves TGF-B off site -> SMCs.
**In vivo, primary function seems to be contained in a matrix and then liberated when needed.
*Can this recruit another population of cells to form SMCs?
*Alt-Ester-Amide links. Walk a line of protein and synthetic polymer, can form secondary structure (i.e. a helix). Need doublet/triplet specificity -> polyionic gels, enzyme susceptability, GF binding, integrin binding. Commercially viable/producable pov. 
*Side chains dictate everything (degrading). 
**Which ones to pick? 
***Evaluate structure of polymer, and behavior with other proteins, cells, etc.


===Mena===
*Linear monomer (100 mg) -> cyclic monomer 
*Fabricate linear monomer prior to cyclization
**Triethyl Amine in DMF. Heat linear monomer in anhydrous environment to make cyclic.
*Cyclic monomer
**Purification protocol from patent (technical difficulties)
***Water contamination
***N2 run-out
**Continue with 2nd batch.
**Crumbly vs. Hairy? Physical precipitate, no worries.


===Scott===
*Fibrin gels ~ 2 wks.
**LD gel, add inhibitors to prohibit degradation = toxic to cells.
**Bulk degradation
***Mechanical loss (gels become softer)
***Loss of mass = cells liberated. 
**Weight loss first. Rheometers.
*Species of thrombin
**Porcine fibrin + bovine thrombine [100u 2 day decay, 50u 3 day decay]
***8 days, no 100u, some 50u
**Porcine fibrin + human thrombin
**Fibrin -> mechanical cross-link
**Thrombin -> coagulation protein - fibrinogen -> fibrin
*'''Tabulate ranges of fibrinogen and thrombin.'''
*'''Back off on thrombin!!!'''


===Charlie===
*TGF-B from fibrin gels, (new literature) stimulate actin/myosin for smooth muscle cell differentiation.
*Release kinetics.
*Differentiation protocols = 1-2 weeks.
*During mass loss, TGF-B dump.
*Goal: Constant release over full time, then go away.
*Proteonomics. Protein expression in gels.


===Office Space===
*Charlie, Jessica upstairs.
*Scott stays in Basement.
*Computers move to old-Charlie space.
**Free space around Mena area.
