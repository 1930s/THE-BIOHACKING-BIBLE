==Presentation Suggestions==
*Overview of Engineering Biology, followed by short focus on our projects based on zooming in on different parts of one central image of a cell operating a system.--[[User:Bcanton|BC]] 10:15, 9 Dec 2005 (EST)
*I really like the outline below and the overall approach.  Didn't think it would be a great idea to have 5 different people talk though, don't know if that is what's suggested below or what. --[[Jason Kelly|JK]]
*Covering all this in 10 15 min will require a tight 2 minute spiel on each project. Whether we have one or two people deliver these or all five of us doesn't matter much to me, but I think it would be easier to have all five of us talk. You're worried about going over time or choppy transitions or what? ~ [[User:Cconboy|cmc]] 14:09, 13 December 2005 (EST)

==Presentation Outline==
Hi gang,

Here's a rough sketch. I think we should try to keep it simple. There's going to be A LOT of information floating around at the meeting, so we just want to give people a flavor.

The flow here goes like this:

# "what is a part/what are we trying to do (overview)"  
#"how do we compose and characterize parts" (Caitlin)
#"how do we build and characterize devices out of parts" (Jason)
#"case in point: zooming in on new types of transcriptional logic" (Reshma)
#"case in point: zooming in on a new type of logic: PTL" (Samantha)
#"engineering an organizm to house all this goodness" (Barry)



Slide 1: Overview of some sort

Slide 2: Explaination of what is a part/device, why POPs, etc. (Classic Drew slide)

Slide 3: Part Characterization and composability (Caitlin)

Slide 4: Device design and characterization (Jason)

Slide 5: Transcriptional Logic (Resh-mama)

Slide 6: New types of logic: PTL logic (Samantha)

Slide 7: A house where we all can live (Barry)
