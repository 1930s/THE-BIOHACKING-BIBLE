===LC'ed 6 colonies each from cPCR #6 & #8 S.A. ligation of F+B+CPX+B0014 into pSB1AC3 in B-R cells===
*37C @ 10pm

==Transformed Ligation of F+B+CPX==
*Used Joey's B-R e.coli cells (electrocompetent)
Electrocompetent procedure:
1. After ligation/denaturation, use pore to filter DNA (10µl) in water in petri dish
2. Add DNA to 50µl of cells
3. Add mixture to cuvette
4. On machine, set to EC20(for e.coli) and measurement to time in ms
5. Load cuvette with knob on right, ensuring that all fluid is on bottom
6. Insert cuvette so that both metal electrodes are touching metal sides of cuvette
7. Press Pulse button
8. Time measurement should be approximately 6 ms (ours were around 5-5.3)
9. Immediately add 1mL of LB to cuvette and transfer mixture back into eppendorf with LB
10. For growing cells on Chloremphenicol media, let cells recuperate for 1 hour. This step is not necessary for Ampicillin.

*Plate all 5 samples (cPCR6, cPCR8, -cPCR6, -cPCR8, F+B+CPX insert only) on both Chloremphenicol and Kanamyacin plates for antibiotic screening. Hopefully colonies will grow only on Chloremphenicol plates.
*Plates placed in 37C at around 12am
