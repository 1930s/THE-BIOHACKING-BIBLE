Abstract:

<br>Cell culture optimization is a labor-intensive process requiring a large number of experiments to be conducted under varying
conditions. Here we describe a high-throughput bioreactor system that allows 12 mini stirred-tank bioreactors to be operated
simultaneously. All bioreactors are monitored by low-cost minimally invasive optical sensors for pH and dissolved oxygen.
The sensors consist of single-use patches affixed inside the bioreactors and monitored optically from the outside. Experimental
results show that different sensing patches with the same composition respond consistently. The discrepancy between different
pH sensors is less than 0.1 pH units over most of their responsive range. The discrepancy between different dissolved oxygen
sensors is less than 10% over the whole range from 0% to 100% dissolved oxygen. The consistency of the sensing system ensures
that only an initial one-time calibration is required for the sensing patches. After that, a calibration code is generated and sensing
patches of the same composition can be used directly. This greatly reduces the time and cost required for monitored multibioreactor
operations.We used SP2/0 myeloma/mouse hybridoma cell cultures to demonstrate reactor performance consistency.
Transcriptional profiling, HPLC analysis, viable cell count, and viability inspection show that the presence of sensing patches
and the use of optical monitoring have no apparent effect on the metabolism of the cells.
