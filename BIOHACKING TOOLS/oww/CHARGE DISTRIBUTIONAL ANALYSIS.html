The distribution of charges in the protein sequence is evaluated in  terms
of  clusters, high scoring segments, and runs and periodic patterns. Clus-
ters indicate regions of typically 30 to 60 residues  exhibiting  a  rela-
tively  high charge concentration. For high scoring charge segments, posi-
tive scores are assigned to charge residues of the  appropriate  type  and
negative  scores  to all other residues. A significant cumulative positive
score again indicates a region of high charge concentration.  The  cluster
method  and  the  scoring method will generally pick out the same segments
(with the scoring method  often  delimiting  the  segment  to  a  narrower
range),  conferring  robustness  to  the  results.  Short segments of high
charge concentration are displayed as runs (with  errors).  Periodic  pat-
terns  focus  on  those  with charges every second or third position, with
possible relevance to amphipathic  secondary  structures;  other  periodic
patterns  are displayed in the general periodicity analysis section of the
output.

A. CHARGE CLUSTERS.

 Positive, negative, and mixed charge clusters are distinguished.  In  each
 case, cmin indicates the minimum number of charges required for a signifi-
 cant charge cluster corresponding to the given window size; e.g.,  cmin  =
 9/30 or 12/45 or 15/60 means that significance requires at least 9 charges
 in a segment of 30 (or fewer) residues, or 12  charges  in  a  segment  of
 length  45,  or 15 charges in a segment of length 60. In the case of posi-
 tive and negative charge clusters, these counts refer to net charge, i.e.,
 charges  of  the  opposite  sign  within the window are counted as -1. The
 sizes of the clusters are optimized for display to indicate the segment of
 highest  charge  concentration,  but  a  minimum  size  of  20 residues is
 required.  A mixed charge cluster that begins and ends within 15  residues
 of the endpoints of a pure charge cluster is not displayed (since its sig-
 nificance rests mostly on the charged residues  comprising  the  displayed
 pure charge cluster), unless the -v (verbose output) flag is set, in which
 case both the pure and the mixed charge  cluster  are  displayed.  On  the
 other  hand,  pure charge clusters that are embedded in mixed charge clus-
 ters are displayed separately (indicated by a * preceding  the  specifica-
 tion of location).
      For each cluster are given its location in the sequence  (From,  to),
 the  quartile  of  the  location  (1st,  2nd,  3rd,  or 4th quarter of the
 sequence), length, count, and t-value (standard deviations above the mean;
 to  accommodate  the  multiple  tests  performed, the t-value significance
 threshold is set to 4.0 for sequences up  to  750  residues,  to  4.5  for
 sequences  of  length 750-1500 residues, and to 5.0 for longer sequences);
 also indicated are residues comprising at least 10% of the cluster.



Positive charge clusters (cmin =  8/30 or 11/45 or 13/60):  none


Negative charge clusters (cmin = 10/30 or 13/45 or 16/60):  none


Mixed charge clusters (cmin = 14/30 or 18/45 or 23/60):

B. HIGH SCORING (UN)CHARGED SEGMENTS.

 For each scoring scheme (scores assigned to residues as  displayed),  SAPS
 displays  segments of the sequence with aggregate score exceeding the par-
 ticular threshold values M_0.01 (1% significance level, segments  labeled
 with  **),  M_0.05 (5% significance level, segments labeled *), or other-
 wise as indicated. A minimal segment length is set as shown.  The expected
 score/letter should be sufficiently large negative, and the average infor-
 mation per letter should be sufficiently large positive in order  for  the
 scoring statistics to apply properly (the program prints out when the con-
 ditions are not met and skips evaluations).

C. CHARGE RUNS AND PATTERNS.

 The table below shows the charge runs and patterns searched for (*  stands
 for  +  or  -)  and  the required minimum number of matches to the pattern
 allowing for at most 0 (lmin0), 1 (lmin1),  or  2  (lmin2)  mismatches  or
 insertions/deletions (1% significance level). Occurrences are arranged in
 the order in which they appear in the sequence. For each  run  or  pattern
 are  displayed  its  length  (number  of matches) and a triplet giving the
 number of mismatches, insertions and deletions. 0-runs are further charac-
 terized  by  their  composition (residues comprising more than 10% of the
 run).
      Run count statistics are compiled for runs of lengths at least 2/3 of
 the minimal significant length (lmin0); given are the number and locations
 of such runs.
