Screening plasmid 2.0 construction has two components:
#Direct synthesis of the I/O reporter section
#*''In progress - order placed 8/25/06''
#Construction of several induction system 'front ends'

=Front End Construction=
Construction steps:
#Build induction system from BB parts, clone into 3K3, 1A3, 2K3?
#Cap forward BB site

==AHL-induced==
#<bbpart>F2620</bbpart> Ptet controls luxR expression
#<bbpart>F2621</bbpart> lux Pl control luxR expression
#Reversed <bbpart>I13212</bbpart> + R0062

===Next Steps===
#Order primers to flip I13212
#Move <bbpart>F2620</bbpart> & <bbpart>F2621</bbpart> into psb1a3, psb3k3, and psb4a3
#Cap E/X for <bbpart>F2620</bbpart> & <bbpart>F2621</bbpart> in each plasmid.
#Constructed reversed I13212, put it in plasmids, and cap E/X

==IPTG-induced==
#Do we have (promoter)(rbs)(lacI)(Plac) already in registry?
#*Nope we don't even have lacI without the ssrA tag, <bbpart>C0013</bbpart> is a designed part w/o the tag, but it wasn't constructed.  Though caitlin said she had ordered the primers for removing the LVA tag at one point.
#**"As for the primers, I'm not sure if they're still around. You can look in the "primers" binder above my old desk to find the name and sequence I used. It probably would have been "C0013_build_F" and "C0013_build_R". There are a few boxes of primers in the -20. (But that set might have gotten tossed...)"
#Reverse lacI

==Arabinose-induced==
#Do we have the right intermediate?
#*<bbpart>P1010</bbpart>
#*<bbpart>I13458</bbpart>+<bbpart>I13453</bbpart>
#**We could build this out just to have a split up version of P1010 (would be a useful registry part).
