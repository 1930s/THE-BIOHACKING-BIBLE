The UsefulChem project is an initiative to carry out open source science based on current problems likely to have chemical solutions in the immediate future.  This includes open discussion of strategies and objectives.

Current projects include the synthesis and testing of anti-malaria and anti-HIV compounds and the treatment of arsenic contaminated well water.

A briefing of the projects and ways of contributing are maintained on the [http://usefulchem.wikispaces.com UsefulChem Wiki].

The project is coordinated by [[Jean-Claude Bradley]].
