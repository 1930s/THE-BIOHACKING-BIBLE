===Working in the lab===
You must get safety training before working in the lab!!!  You must renew your traing yearly by taking an online refresher course (see the Safety page of the Wiki).  Training sessions are held the third Thursday of every month.  The training session will not be the most exciting three hours of your life, but you will not suffer terribly either.  They make no real effort to train you in the specific skills you need to work safely in your lab (there are far too many possible scenarios), but do give you a good overview of the general requirements and resources at Harvard.
