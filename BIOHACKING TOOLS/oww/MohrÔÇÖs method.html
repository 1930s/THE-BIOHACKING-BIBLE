==Detailed protocol==
<br/>
'''1. Preparation of ~1 N original solutions of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CaCl<sub>2</sub> '''
<br/>
<br/>
'''''500 ml MgCl<sub>2</sub>''''' <br/>
(MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 6 H<sub>2</sub>O = 203 g/mol) <br/>

*101.65 g MgCl<sub>2</sub> dissolved in distilled water in 500 ml volumetric flask,
*make it up to the mark with distilled water. <br/>
*Mix the solution up to total dilution.
<br/>
'''''500 ml CaCl<sub>2</sub>'''''<br/>

(CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 H<sub>2</sub>O = 147.02 g/mol)<br/>

*73.51 g CaCl<sub>2</sub> dissolved in distilled water in 500 ml volumetric flask, make it up to the mark with distilled water.
*Be careful, the distilled water must be added little by little since the reaction emanate a lot of warmth. *Mix the solution up to total dilution and wait for cooling. 
<br/>
'''2. Preparation of ~0.05 N diluted solutions of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CaCl<sub>2</sub>'''
<br/>
*Dilute original solutions of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CaCl<sub>2</sub> by a factor 20 by taking 5 ml of original solution with an automatic pipet, pipetting it into a 100 ml volumetric flasks, and making it up to the mark with distilled water.
*N.B. Pour a part (~20 ml) of the original solution of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CaCl<sub>2</sub> in 2 beakers rather than pipetting directly in the volumetric flasks.
<br/>
'''3. Titration of diluted solutions with standardized silver nitrate solution'''
<br/>
*Pipette a 25 ml aliquot of diluted solutions of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CaCl<sub>2</sub> (with 25 ml volumetric pipets) into 50 ml erlenmeyer flasks (3 replicates for each solution).
*Add small magnetic stir bars. 
*Add a pinch of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and some drops (2-3 drops) of K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> indicator (diluted potassium chromate solution) in the erlenmeyer flasks. 
*Fill the 50 ml buret with the 0.1 N silver nitrate solution.
*Titrate the diluted solutions of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CaCl<sub>2</sub> with the silver nitrate solution (a drop at a time) up to the first appearance of a red-brown color (see Figure 1)
*Use the mean of the 3 titrations as a final result.

'''4. Calculation of the normality of CaCl<sub>2</sub> and MgCl<sub>2</sub> in the original solutions'''<br/>
*Calculate the average volume of AgNO<sub>3</sub> used for the titration of the three replicates of diluted solutions:<br/>

volume of AgNO<sub>3</sub> (0.1 N) = '''''V'''''
<br/>
<br/>
*Calculate the amount (in mol) of AgNO<sub>3</sub> reacting: '''''x''''' = '''''V''''' x 0.1 mol
<br/>
*Calculate the amount (in mol) of chloride ions reacting:<br/>
**for 25 ml of diluted solution: '''''x''''' / 2 mol MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CaCl<sub>2</sub>
**for 1 l of diluted solution : '''''x''''' / 2 x 40 mol MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CaCl<sub>2</sub>
**for 1 l of original solution: '''''x''''' / 2 x 40 x 20 mol MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CaCl<sub>2</sub>
<br/>
'''''Original solution normality''' (mol/l) = '''(''V'' x 0.1 / 2) x 40 x 20 / 1000'''''
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
'''5. Calculation of the density of CaCl<sub>2</sub> and MgCl<sub>2</sub> in the original solutions'''
<br/>
Weigh at least 3 aliquots of 20 ml of original solution in beakers and calculate the average weight ('''''W''''', g)<br/>
<br/>
'''''Density''' (g/ml) = '''''W''''' '''/ 20'''''<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
'''6. Calculation of the weight of original CaCl<sub>2</sub> and MgCl<sub>2</sub> solution'''<br/>
(for ½ l of buffer solutions)
<br/>
<br/>
'''''Weight''' (g) = '''((molarity / normality) x density x 1000) / 2'''''<br/>
<br/>
'''''Molarity''' =
0.05474 / 2 mol MgCl<sub>2</sub> and
0.01075/2 mol CaCl<sub>2</sub> for ½ l of buffer solution''
