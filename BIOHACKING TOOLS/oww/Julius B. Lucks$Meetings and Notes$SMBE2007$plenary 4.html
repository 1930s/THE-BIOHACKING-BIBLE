* all nucl on planet earch - 10^25 kilometers of DNA - 10 diameter of known universe
* big diff between comparative genomics and evolutionary genomics (more explanitory)
** need deep understanding of cell and mol biol
** evol is pop genetic process
** explain genomic diversity (and invoke natural selection) - need null hypothesis (genome evol in absence of selection)
* pop genetic env - 4 forces of evol
** recombination
** mutation
** random genetic drift
** selection
* complexity required for more complex phenotypes?
* recombination rate scales with organism size
* bigger genomes - bigger chromosomes (not more, generally)
* scaling between genome size and mutation rate / generation
** euk - a lat of mutations in replication
* mobile elements
** human genome - almost 50%
** huge disparity in the number of these in diff genomes
** what does it take for mobile el pop to survive inside a genome
*** parasitic DNA - accumulates at cost of host
** avg insertion is deleterious (flies)
*** causes reduction of fitness of around 1%
** increase host eff pop size - can eliminate del. effects by natural selection
*** avg autonomous el can't produce offspring within host lifetime
*** critical host pop size
** unicellular species have larger pop sizes - more effective nat selection
*** no mobile elements
** LTR - new element at time of birth has 100% identical repeats
*** can get age distribution from looking at repeat structure
*** invertebte, plants, fish - negative exp decays
**** long term steady state birth death process
**** don't find many that are old - being eliminated by natural selection
*** exception to this in placental mammals
**** bulge in age distribition
**** change in evol time in birth rate and/or death rate of LTRs
*** prior to KT boundary, looked single decay
**** was age of dinosaurs - after this, mammals eff pop size increased
**** avg placental mammal genome been shrinking after KT boundary
* 2 episodes make planet unhospitable - snowball earth
** whole planet frozen - 35 million years each
** oblique situation for any organism - pop sizes go through bottleneck
** 1st prior to euk
** 2nd prior to all animal groups
* mut makes variation, nat sel operates on it
* mutation itself can have a weak selective force
* avg human introns 1000s bp - exons 125 bp on avg
** this arose prior to multicellularity
* 5' UTR bad for you
** euk - scanning mechanism to find 1st AUG codon
** 5' UTR can cause premature start - leads to effective protein
* gigantic viruses
** polygna viresus - endosymbiotic - part of parasitic wasps
** huge genomes - 80% non-coding DNA - including introns
** once put in certain pop-gen context, even viral genomes can behave like this
* point - many of these genome features (introns, 5' UTR's, etc) can arise by random drift processes - not selection
* how does modular gene-regulatory structure originate?
** advantage to host (allow more gen variation)?
** can emerge passively without any selective force
** increase mod struture, also increase mutational target size
* network evolution
