==Research Interests==
'''Translational regulation and control strategies.''' In all branches of life organisms have evolved highly sophisticated strategies to regulate gene expression. Although transcriptional level control has been extensively studied, translational level events are becoming more important to understand. A primary example is the observation that there is very limited correlation between mRNA abundance and protein concentration. As we try to reprogram cellular behavior with increasingly sensitive systems, this paradox will become an important phenomena to understand in order to produce optimized cellular responses.
