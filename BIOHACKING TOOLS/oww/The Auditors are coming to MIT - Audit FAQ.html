'''EHS Management System External Audit'''

MIT has implemented a comprehensive and integrated Environment, Health and Safety Management System (EHS-MS), a highly collaborative effort that draws on the leadership and expertise of faculty, researchers, students, administrators, and staff.  The EHS Management System is helping to reshape how members of the MIT community view their environment, health, and safety responsibilities, and carry out MIT’s EHS commitment in their day-to-day activities.

As a measure of our commitment to the success of the Institutes EHS Management System, external auditors, in conjunction with the MIT Audit Division, will conduct an Institute-wide audit.  The auditors will examine the overall implementation and effectiveness of the EHS Management System as required by MIT’s EPA and Department of Justice consent decree.

You may already be familiar with many facets of the EHS Management System, such as required EHS training, weekly self-inspections (Level I) done by your EHS Representative, and inspections (Level II) done by your departmental EHS Committee and Coordinator.  A pilot audit is slated for September through October 2005.  This pilot audit is in preparation for the Institute-wide external audit required in the spring of 2006.

To be successful, MIT needs you to make the difference.  Use the following FAQ to increase your awareness of the EHS Management System audit.
