Presented here is the sordid history of our environmental rooms, 405B (30 degree room) and 406B (25 degree microscope room):

Future:  perfect harmony, constant temperature and humidity 

Present:  doubts remain

Past:  turmoil

406B<br>

'''070705'''  Visit from Harris technician (name?) responsible for environmental rooms on campus.  He will be performing regular maintenance on our room.  He locked all but the set-point control on the instrument panel.  He also went up and had a look around above the room.  He thought that the auto-reset switch on the compressor should restart the compressor fast enough that only a tiny blip should be seen on the chart recorder (blip = 1-degrees in 15min, not 5deg over 2hrs).

'''070701'''  Temperature climbed approx 5deg over 2hrs, then rapidly returned to 25deg and stayed there.  Shay called facilities.

Minus-Eleven replaced water valve (I have the old one in my drawer)
Rick and Barbara get involved

Large change probably due to Juan turning of fans during an experiment and forgetting to turn them back on

Another blip, probably due to scheduled power shut-down 

Minus-Eleven installed an auto-reset on compressor.  This will automatically turn compressor back on after it shuts-off due to low water pressure ( a safety feature that keeps the compressor from overheating should the flow of cooling water be shutoff).
