''Nakajima et. al''

* cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus (PCC 7942)
* three genes components (kaiA, kaiB, and kaiC)
* Kai proteins regulate the kaiBC operon
** Oscillation of KaiC phosphorylation cycle is the pacemaker, molecular timer
** KaiA enhances KaiC autophosphorylation
** KaiB attenuates the effect of KaiA 
** Oscillation of KaiC phosphorylation maybe generated by KaiA and KaiB cooperation
* Nakajima et. al incubated recombinant KaiC protein with KaiA and KaiB at a ratio similar to in vivo to test it in vitro
* KaiC phosphorylation oscillated robustly without damping
* KaiC not degraded during the reaction
* Oscillation of KaiC phosphorylation is autonomous due to cooperation of three Kai proteins
* The thermal sensitivity in vitro same as in vivo gene expression rhythm
* They found that KaiC phosphorylation is the molecular timer for the circadian rhythm of Synechococcus
* KaiC hexamer may have many phosphorylation states with different biochemical characteristics
* In addition, the reaction rate of KaiC phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are slow reducing the energy needed
