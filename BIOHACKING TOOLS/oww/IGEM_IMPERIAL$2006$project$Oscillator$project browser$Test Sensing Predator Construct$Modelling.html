__NOTOC__
==Model assumptions and relevance==

*General assumptions on gene expression modelling:
**Quasi-steady state hypothesis on mRNA expression.
**Gene activation can be approximated by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_equation Hill equations].

*Assumptions linked to the quorum sensing:
**As a first approximation, we assume that luxR and AHL molecules form a heterodimer (even if it has been found that the complex formed is more complicated).
**The degradation rate of luxR and aiiA is mainly due to the growth dilution.

==Model description of the oscillator==

'''[http://openwetware.org/wiki/IGEM:IMPERIAL/2006/project/Oscillator/Modelling Full derivation of the above equations.]'''

==Model description of the growth of the predator==
*mathematical description of the predator growth and death:
**<math>\frac{d[luxR]}{dt} = \frac{c * [AHL] * [luxR]}{(c0 + [AHL] * [luxR])} - gd * [luxR]</math>
**<math>\frac{d[aiiA]}{dt} = \frac{c * [AHL] * [luxR]}{(c0 + [AHL] * [luxR])} - gd * [aiiA]</math>

*insert a graphical representation if possible (e.g. CellDesigner display)
*link to SBML file or matlab.

==Model variables and parameters for the growth of the predator==

(list all the variables and parameters of the model in a table, specifying if their values are known, unknown, to be measured.)

==Characterization==

*Parameters c & c0 for characterization have to be extracted.
*gd[luxR] and gd[aiiA] can be controlled by the chemostat.
