This protocol uses annealing and primer extension to generate a short fragment of DNA (~100 bp) using Taq polymerase.  The DNA fragment can be immediately used in a TA cloning reaction.  (To proceed to a restriction digest step, [[Purification of DNA|purification]] is necessary.)

==Materials==

*Two oligos which overlap by ~20 bp.

Oligo 1: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5' ----------------------------------- 3'<br>
Oligo 2:    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3' ----------------------------------- 5'

==Procedure==
#Dilute the two oligos to a concentration of 25 &mu;M using H<sub>2</sub>O.

#*Notes on [[Knight:TOPO TA cloning#Notes|efficient addition of 3'A to PCR products]].
#Mix the following in a 0.6 mL sterile tube
#*9 &mu;L PCR supermix
#*0.5 &mu;L oligo 1
#*0.5 &mu;L oligo 2
#Anneal and extend the two oligos together by placing the mixture in a thermal cycler ([http://www.mjr.com MJ Research], PTC-200) and running the following protocol.
##94&deg;C for 5 mins
##94&deg;C for 30 seconds
##56&deg;C for 30 seconds (or whatever an appropriate annealing temperature is)
##68&deg;C for 30 seconds
##Repeat steps 2-4 2-3 cycles
##68&deg;C for 5 mins
#Use fresh 1&mu;L PCR product in a [[Knight:TOPO TA cloning|TOPO TA cloning reaction]].

==Notes==
*For oligos greater than 50-60 bp in length, there can often be problems with errors or deletions in the primers.  Therefore, it might be worth ordering your primers with an extra purification step such as PAGE.  [https://catalog.invitrogen.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=customerSite.primersHome Invitrogen custom primers] offers this service for an extra fee.
*'''[[User:Rshetty|RS]] 21:30, 14 June 2006 (EDT)''': I recently have been trying to make a promoter via this method.  I sequenced 3 different clones and all of them had a 1bp deletion in the same position.  This was despite the fact that I had ordered my primers to be PAGE purified.  I emailed Invitrogen and they said that they will resynthesize and ship me a new primer free of charge.  We'll see what happens.
*'''[[User:Rshetty|Reshma]] 19:49, 19 October 2006 (EDT)''': Tom suggests considering how much enzyme you use relative to how much primer.  Supposedly, polymerase does not necessarily fall off the ends of the DNA which means in 2-3 cycles, very few of your annealed primers will become completely double-stranded (as this requires two polymerases to bind to the same annealed primer molecule and extend).  This lack of complete double stranding could increase the potential for errors.
