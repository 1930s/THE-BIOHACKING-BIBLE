T1TE-plx007

T1TE-T1T2-pcc010

double digestion test applied to these two plasmids

==sequencing results==
change the primers to ensure the right result!

==transformation==
Prec, Plac, Psul, SS1-3,SD1-3 ligated with GFP-plx007 for 5 hours

SDY-EGFP-plx007 positive transformation

==re-colony PCR of T1TE-T1T2-pcc010==
forget to make the positive control! failed.
