==Results from Sequencing==

Some J45700s and pBANANAs seemed to work although some internal primers' sequencing results were not very clear.  The premade J45800s did not have the correct sequencing results.  The phase-sensitive pBANANAs' sequencing was bad.

==Results from Colony PCR==

Almost all of the premade J45800s had multiple bands.  If they did not, they had the wrong sized bands except in one case.  Two of the ligations looked somewhat promising.  I will go ahead and miniprep all of them for sequencing Monday AM.  Many of them SEEMED to smell faintly like mint to me.

==Plan==

1. Update google doc- DONE

2. Run gels on colony PCRs of hopeful J45800s (from miniprep transformation and ligation)- DONE

3. Grow up 100 mL and 10 mL cultures and glycerol the parts which had positive sequencing results- DONE

4. Miniprep one promising J45800 premade colony, three J45170.J45320 ligations, three osmYS.inverter.E0840 ligations, one osmYL.E0840 transformation for sequencing Monday AM- DONE
