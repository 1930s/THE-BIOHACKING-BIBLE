==Description==
The First-year Representative facilitates interactions between the BE Board and the first year class, making known the needs and opinions of the class.  The first-year rep is also encouraged to take a GSC rep position, which gives us access to more GSC funds for our events and gives you experience with larger grad student governance at MIT.
