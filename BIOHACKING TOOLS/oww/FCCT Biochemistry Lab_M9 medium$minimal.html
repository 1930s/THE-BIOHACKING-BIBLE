We used to prepare the '''plain M9 medium''' as follows:

{| 
| 900 ml sterile water
|-
| 100 ml M9 salts stock solution
|-
| 1 ml autoclaved 1 M MgSO<sub>4</sub>
|-
| 0.1 ml autoclaved 1 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>
|}



'''M9 stock solution''' (10x) is:
{|
| 60 g Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> x 7 H<sub>2</sub>O
|-
| 30 g KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>
|-
| 5 g NaCl
|-
| 10 g NH<sub>4</sub>Cl
|-
| add water to 1000 ml and autoclave
|}

==Notes==
''Note 1: salts that are added last often tend to precipitate. I didn't bother about it too much as obviously it didn't influence bacterial growth. There might be a way to avoid precipitation (eventually adding magnesium and calcium first) but I didn't investigate this in detail.''

''Note 2: The M9 stock solution here is essentially as in the [http://openwetware.org/wiki/M9_salts M9 salts] recipe just that the concentration is about half of that. Nevertheless, bacteria are normally OK with this.''
