==What is the Point of this Project?==
'''Debugging!'''

The goal of this project is to characterize the inner workings of the [[Ssutton:_PTL_Logic#A_Basic_PTL_System:_Kinase-Kinase_circuit| phospholocator]] , designed and built by [[User:Ssutton | Samantha Sutton]].  Although we know ''how'' the phospholocator device works, we  don't have a quantitative description of how the parts interact.

Since the effectiveness (gain) of the phospholocator (PPL) device depends on the kinase parts being active, or phosphorylated, I will spend this summer finding out:
*how much phosphorylated kinase is present in a cell
*the relationship between phosphorylated kinase and phosphorylated PPL
*how changing the concentration of active kinase and PPL in the cell effects the gain of the system
*how to use this knowledge (which will be collected and posted on the [[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Main_Page Registry of Standard Biological Parts]]) to increase the gain of the PPL
