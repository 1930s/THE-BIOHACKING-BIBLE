This presentation from the Bio[[MIBLab]] [[Summer 2006 Workshop]] is a [[Summer 2006 Workshop#Analysis|analysis]] bioinformatics tool.

The goal of Tmm is to mine public microarray datasets for reliably and reproducibly coexpressed genes. In this manner, a user can obtain lists of usually 10-100 transcripts that coexpress with the user's gene of interest.

==Synopsis==
Analysis of multiple microarray data sets to find reliably coexpressed genes

==Features==
*Useful to make a small list of probable targets.
*Useful for some validation?
::Similar to GOMiner validation.
::Speed will inhibit this.
*Semantics is a barrier to usefulness.
