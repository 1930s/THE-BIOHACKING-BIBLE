Post-transcriptional modification in RNA is a very common phenomenon in nature, just like post-translational modifications of proteins. Modifications are present in tRNA and rRNA, from all three kingdoms of life, as well as in mRNA, snRNA and other RNA in eukaryotes. My doctoral project is aimed at developing a microarray system that simultaneously detects and quantifies the extent of all RNA modifications and to eventually apply this microarray system to examine the effect of modification on the RNA aminoacylation in living systems as a function of environmental conditions.
