Somehow, if we can get mouth bacterial cells to take up R(-)carvones (spearamint) and excrete it shortly after encountering food (glucose?) <-- looks like a glucose-sensing-carvone-excreting experiment to me. Possible problem might be getting both enantiomers of the compound. Which would give us some gingergrassy smell. Mmm, better than bad breath, eh?


Methyl salicylate is probably easier to make.  Check out this reference:

This article captures the last stage of synthesis and expresses it in E. coli.  Salicylic acid is supplied exogenously.
