Involves the modelling and simulation of biological systems, for the design of better drugs and to achieve a better understanding of the biology of disease. Constructed an in silico model of the mycolic acid pathway in ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' and performed Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) and Minimisation of Metabolic Adjustment (MoMA) analysis on the model. Possible new targets for anti-tubercular drugs were also identified. A tool, [[Chandra:Software and Databases:PathwayAnalyser|PathwayAnalyser]], for the analysis of metabolic pathways by FBA/MoMA was developed, based on open-source optimisation libraries. Further, a comprehensive phylogenetic profiling of the mycolic acid pathway proteins against over 250 completed genomes was carried out, yielding further insights into functional linkages between proteins. Analysis of protein-protein interactions through metabolic pathways is also underway.

===Other Interests (mainly reading...)=== 
<font size=2px>(or what I would have been doing, if not a thesis in systems biology)</font>
* Number Theory – High precision calculations
* Primality Testing and Factorisation algorithms
* Numerical Software (better than [http://mathassist.tripod.com/ MathAssistant]!)
* Bio-mimetic programming e.g. Genetic Algorithms
* Semi-numerical Algorithms (yeah, Knuth vol 2!)

==Personal==
===Bio===
I did my schooling in [http://dav99batch.tripod.com/ DAV Boys Senior Secondary School, Chennai]. I graduated from [http://www.udct.org/ UDCT (University of Mumbai, Department of Chemical Technology)] in 1999, with a bachelor's degree in ''Food Technology and Engineering'' and joined [http://www.iisc.ernet.in IISc] in 2003, for a ''Masters in Computational Science''. In 2005, I successfully applied for an upgrade to the PhD programme, and I am now pursuing my PhD in Systems Biology, with [[Nagasuma Chandra|Dr Nagasuma Chandra]] and [http://mbu.iisc.ernet.in/%7Evishgp/ Prof Saraswathi Vishveshwara] as my advisors. We work on the modelling of microbial systems, particularly in relation to disease and are interested in identifying possible new targets for drug design, based on metabolic analysis.
