'''MIT iGEM 2005 Laboratory "Bootcamp" Day 4'''
(run by Natalie Kuldell and Kate Bacon Schneider)


I. Ligations
*Background Information:
**Ligase is the enzyme that can catalyze the formation of the phosphodiester bond between two nucleotides
**ATP dependent reaction
**Molar ratio of insert: backbone should be 2:1 or 3:1-->want to favor insert ends finding vector ends
**Want to do control with vector DNA alone-->growth after transformation tells you if the vector religated (or was uncut in the first place)
** Typical reaction conditions (20 µL total volume):
***water 
***1 µL vector (backbone)
*** µL insert (part)
***10X ligation buffer-->working concentration of 1X
***0.5 µL ligase
**Run reaction for 10-15 minutes at 15˚C 
***low temperature favors hydrogen bonding of sticky ends to each other, and reduces molecular motion so that ends can "find" each other in solution)
*Exercise:
**Students ligate their purified vector and insert along with appropriate controls


II. Transformations
*Background Information:
**transformation is a method for introducing plasmid DNA into (bacterial) cells
**''E. coli'' is not naturally able to take up DNA from its environment, but other bacterial species are
**many ways to make ''E. coli'' "competent"—or able to take up DNA from the cellular environment—including electroporation and CaCl2 treatment
**Making cells "competent" involves a weakening of the cell membrane-->therefore cells are fragile (so keep on ice)
**Basic protocol involves:
***incubating DNA and cells together (allows DNA to interact with cell surface
***heat shock cells (usually 37-42˚C)-->cells take up DNA
***ice (close up pores of membrane)
***outgrowth in rich media (allows cells to "recover" from treatment and to express the gene that confers resistance to antibiotic on backbone
***plating on selective media (chosen such that only cells that have taken up ligated plasmid will grow)
*Exercise:
**Students set up three transformations of 7.02 cloning strain (AG1111, CaCl2 competent):  vector + insert ligation, vector alone ligation, no DNA ligation.
**Cells were plated on LB Amp and grown O/N @ 37˚C
