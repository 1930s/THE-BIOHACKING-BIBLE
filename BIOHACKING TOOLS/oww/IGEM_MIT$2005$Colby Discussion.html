*What antigen do we want to attack? Anything.
*Tricky part: having generic chain to signal the event.
*To detect surface binding
**Flow cytometry to detect presence of antigen
*George Georgiou at UT.
*Hellinga at Duke.
*Induction systems - gene. mod. cell that binds to pheromone to gene expression.
**Modifications made to fuse antibody: no modifications at all. Just fuse DNA to make fusion protein.
**Usu. use single chain antibody, not entire igg. Just through binding.
**"Antibody Structure" to see more ideas about domains.
*Mechanisms:
**voltage-gated channels
**ligang-gated channels
**dimerization
***2 antibodies fuse to 2 diff. cell units and having antibody rec different parts to bring subunits close together to bind.
****feasibility: depends on size of antigen; protein = easy; 15-20 aa. Small molecule would be harder (probably not). 
***Generic system = potentially difficult. Only limits of proteins. 
**cleavage of transcription factor
**g proteins
