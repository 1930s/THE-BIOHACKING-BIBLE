== Research Interests ==
:The goal of metabolic flux analysis (MFA) is the quantitative determination of all intracellular fluxes in a system of interest.  Results are obtained by introducing a labeled substrate (usually a labeled carbon source) into a cell culture, measuring relative labeling in metabolic byproducts, and computationally processing these measurements to arrive at fluxes.

:Nonstationary metabolic flux analysis (NMFA) is similar to MFA with the provision that metabolite labeling is sampled and measured before the system reaches an isotopic steady state. NMFA, though computationally more complex, claims several advantages over its stationary analog.  First, the amount of prohibitively expensive labeled substrate required for an experiment is greatly reduced.  Second, the duration of such an experiment is considerably shortened, adding credibility to the metabolic steady-state assumption necessary for all flux analyses.  Third, nonstationary flux analysis allows the pool sizes of metabolites, including intracellular intermediates, to be estimated in addition to the fluxes themselves.

:I am working with the theoretical, computational, and experimental aspects of NMFA.  In particular, I hope to apply NMFA to different strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to shed light on the metabolic impact of certain genetic modifications.
