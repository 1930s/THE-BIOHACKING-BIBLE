I would like to propose that we start a regular Journal Club. 

Benefits of having a regular Journal Club:
* We will explore current research topics more deeply through discussion than by individual reading.
* We will be exposed to new topics that we wouldn't normally flag ourselves.
* We will become more knowledgeable of other Endy/Knight lab projects.
* We will discuss more papers than the sporadic one or two per year that we read under the current Journal Club model.


I know that we have tried holding regular Journal Clubs in the past, and that they all fizzled. So I would like to propose a new format that would perhaps be more sustainable:

*Meet once or twice per month
**We would meet on the same day of the week at the same time, so it would become a habit (like group meeting).
*Assign each journal club to one club member
**This person would be in charge of selecting a paper and leading the discussion.
**We could assign slots in a similar manner to group snack (a duty which is never neglected, hehe)
*Invite people from outside the Endy/Knight labs, who may have an interest in our topics of discussion.
**This might freshen up the meetings, so it isn't always the same group with which we always hang out.


I would love to hear any thought you guys might have about this.

===Thoughts/Suggestions===
* Whoever is leading JC should be prepared to present the paper in brief to set up discussion. (This lowers the barrier for people to attend JC.)
* JC should be recorded on the wiki to generate summaries of important papers and allow ongoing/archived discussions.
* Papers to be discussed could be selected from a [[Endy: Journal Club: Suggested Reading|"wishlist"]] that everyone contributes to. Seconding suggested papers will determine the level of interest.
