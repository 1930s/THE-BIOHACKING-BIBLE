#Measured the voltage of the Sine wave using the scopes reading of 20.0V / division * 2 divisions = 40V
#using the cursors, Cursor 1 - Cursor 2 = 24V - -16.2V = 40.2V
#using the measure function Pk-Pk 40.1V


#next for the frequency similarly. 3 division / 2 waves = 1.5 Div/wave * 500 us / div = 750us = 1.333 kHz
#for the cursor the delta is 780 us = 1.282kHz
#using measure function Freq = 1.326 kHz

The Scope does not measure near the top range of the function generator (1 MHz) very well.
