== Miniprep of J36335 (KaiA + KaiC), J36832 (KaiB) ==
We performed 8 minipreps each of J36335 and J36832, eluted in 30 µL EB.

== Digest of J36335\S-P (KaiA + KaiC), J36832\X-P (KaiB) ==
We did 8 digests each of J36335\S-P and J36832\X-P.

=== Presentation notes ===
* More pictures in general-- picture of cyanobacteria
* Slide with Western blot: label it with conclusion of experiment
* Cut "Interaction experiments" slide; copy Kai model to results page, delete arrows to show predicted effect
* Conclusion slide, or at least say some closing words before going on to acknowledgements
