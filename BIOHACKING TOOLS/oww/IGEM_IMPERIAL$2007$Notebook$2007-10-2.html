==Evaporation experient==
*We carried on experiments from yesterday to find a method to reduce evaporation of samples
*Results???

==Test purified luxR==
*'''Aim''': The aim of this experiment was to test if the purified luxR works and if the construct 2 works
*To test the purified luxR we used these [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Wet Lab/Protocols/Prot1.7|protocols]]
*The results of this experiment can be found [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/new pages/Construct 2|here]]
*The purified LuxR appeared to be functional in vitro, however there were stability issues that reduce the synthesis of GFPmut3b when pLux-GFPmut3b is used with purified LuxR. 
*For the characterisation of the infector detector system the pTet-LuxR-pLux-GFPmut3b (construct 1) will be used.

==Test pT7 in-vivo==
*'''Aim''': The aim of the test was to verify that pT7-GFP expresses in-vivo
*The test was carried out using these protocols??
*The results can be found here??
