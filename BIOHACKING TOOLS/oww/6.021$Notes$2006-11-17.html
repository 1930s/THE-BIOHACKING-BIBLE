==Myelinated axons==
* Potential is not just at nodes
** Is greatly spread out
** Reacts very slowly
* Voltage clamp
** 3 barriers to separate 3 nodes
** Test one node by shorting out the 2 adjacent nodes with KCl in bath
*** <math>V_K = 0 \rightarrow V_m = 0 \rightarrow G_K \uparrow</math>
** Inject current in one, force zero voltage drop across other side via feedback to measure node in middle
* Fitting data
** Frog
*** <math>I_{Na}=\overline{I_{Na}}(V_m)m^2h</math>
*** <math>I_K=\overline{I_K}(V_m)n^2</math>
*** <math>I_p=\overline{I_p}(V_m)p^2</math> (different sodium)
** Rabbit
*** <math>I_{Na}=\overline{I_{Na}}(V_m)m^2h</math>
*** <math>I_K=</math>small
* Model of myelinated fiber
** Core conductor model with cable model at internodes and Hodgkin-Huxley like model at nodes
* Internode parameters
** inner diameter d, outer diameter with myelin D, length L
** Experimentally find <math>d \propto D \propto L</math> in many different cells
** Why does this scaling hold?
** <math>L \approx 0.5 \lambda_c</math> tends to give the fastest conduction
*** Internode is electrically small, ''but just barely''
*** The entire internode is roughly isopotential
** <math>v = \frac{L}{\tau_m}</math> and <math>\tau_m</math> is independent of shape
* Fault tolerant: safety factor
** Several nodes (amplifiers) can fail and still give an action potential (but takes longer -- more delay)
* Myelinated fiber advantages
