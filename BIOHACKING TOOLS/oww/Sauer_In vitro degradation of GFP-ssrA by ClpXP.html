==Protocol 1==
===PD buffer (1X)===

25 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6

5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>

0.032% NP-40 (Nonidet P40 substitute)

10% glycerol

*Make 4X stock and store at -20 ˚C.

===ATP regeneration mix (1X)===

4 mM ATP

16 mM creatine phosphate

0.32 mg/mL creatine kinase

*Make 10X stock and store at -20 ˚C.

===Reaction===

1X PD buffer

200 mM KCl

1X ATP regeneration mix

100 nM ClpX<sub>6</sub>

300 nM ClpP<sub>14</sub>

0.15–10 µM GFP-ssrA

*For GFP-ssrA degradation followed by fluorescence, use 60 µL reaction, 0.3 mm cuvette.
*If you are using SspB, include it at a concentration that is equal to that of the GFP-ssrA you are using.
*Be sure to equalize the salts that may come in with your proteins (GFP, SspB, etc.) across reactions because ClpX is very salt sensitive.
*Make a mix of everything except GFP and SspB such that you will add an equal amount of the master mix to each reaction. I usually make my GFP+SspB equal to 20 µL and add 40 µL of the mix to each reaction.--[[user:kathmc|Kathleen]]
*Keep everything on ice until you are ready to do the reaction.

===Measuring degradation===
*Get instructions on how to use the [[Sauer:Fluorimeter|fluorimeter]].
*excitation wavelength = 467 nm, emission wavelength = 511 nm
*water bath at 30 ˚C

Pre-warm cuvette in cuvette holder for at least 5 min prior to each reaction.

Pre-warm GFP (and SspB, if using) in cuvette for 2 min.

Pre-warm ClpX mix for reaction in a tube in the water bath.

Add warmed ClpX mix to GFP in cuvette and mix well, trying not to introduce any bubbles.

Start measuring fluorescence and measure for ~10 min, or until reaction is finished.

'''Slit width'''
*Set all four the same, it's easier that way. 1 turn = 1 full turn of the screw.
*This is just a guideline. Test it out to see what works best for your samples.
