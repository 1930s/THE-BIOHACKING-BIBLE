==Sample preparation==
Frozen samples were thawed on ice and diluted to prepare a simple Coomassie-stain gel check. Is the overexpression visible? If so it might be too much for a physiologically relevant pulldown.


'''Loading of samples''' was a big problem, they were gooey and didn't want to go into the wells. Look up sample prep protocols for bacteria.


===Quick and dirty protein expression sample prep===
#transfer volume X into 1.5 ml tube, X = 0.25 ml / OD
#spin 30 sec
#resuspend pellet in 30 µl H2O
#add 3 µl 1 M DTT and 11 µl 4 x SDS Loading Buffer (i.e. 10% SDS)
#5 min at 50ºC
#2 min at 100ºC
#spin 5 min 

===Preparation of whole cell extract===
*thaw 96 bacterial pellets room temperature
*resuspend in 100 µl Lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA or 0.1 mM EDTA, if NiNTA purification follows)
*add 25 µl of

*resuspend lysates, add 15 µl to the plate, mix by pipetting

*load 7 µl on SDS-PAGE

==SDS-PAGE==
We're using the Invitrogen Nu-PAGE system with Novex bis-tris 4-12% gels' and MES running buffer to get the high resolution in the low kDa-range (as advertised).

===NuPage sample preparation (post-extraction)===
Heat samples for 2min at 85 deg C '''NOT''' at 95 deg C as we would usually do. This has to do with the composition of Invitrogen's reagents.
