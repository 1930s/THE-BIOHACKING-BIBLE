==Quantomix Wet EM==

[http://www.quantomix.com Quantomix] is a company which makes sealable electron transparent capsules for Wet EM.  

I have used these capsules to do some EM on IC21 cells.

I tried uranyl acetate and osmium tetraoxide - standard stains.

I have also tried collodial gold-streptavidin-biotin-phalloidin - to try to label actin specifically.

But most interesting of all - I tried using quantum dots-streptavidin-biotin-phalloidin - to label actin.  This allows us to do fluorescent microscopy and electron microscopy on the exact same sample, without further modification.
