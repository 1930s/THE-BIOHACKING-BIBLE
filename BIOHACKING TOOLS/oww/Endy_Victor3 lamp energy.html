==Background==
When defining a label on the [[Endy:Victor3 plate reader|Victor3 plate reader]], it is possible to vary the lamp energy used for excitation.  It was thought that increasing this energy might give higher signal to noise ratios and generally increase signal amplification.

==Test Labels==
To test this hypothesis, a number of labels were created that used identical parameters (485nm excitation, 535/25nm emission, top counting, normal apertures, 0.1s measurement time) but varied the lamp energy over almost the full range (0-65000).

==Test Samples==
A stationary phase overnight of I7101.4A3 in MG1655 and untransformed MG1655 in supplemented M9 were tested along with a supplemented M9 media blank.  

==Meausurements==
The ratios of transformed to untransformed (GFP/No GFP) and transformed to plain media (Signal/Noise) are plotted below for the range of lamp energies tested.

==Discussion==
This data suggests that, under the conditions tested, signal to noise ratios cannot be improved significantly by varying lamp energies.
