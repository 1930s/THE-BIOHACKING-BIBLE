==Yeast Stuff==
# Yeast strain (ACLY379) finally grew up overnight. Diluted back at 9:45 AM, and will commence transformation after SB lunch.
#I let the gel of yesterday's digest results run a bit longer to see the exact length of the vectors, and it appears that most of our vectors are just the backbone vector, no insert. 
##But there are faint bands that might be the correct length. I'll rerun and gel extract, if the bands are visible enough.
#Transformation
## Use high-efficiency protocol because we want to give this transformation the best shot possible.
##Transform the amalagam of G5, G6, G7 digests from Oct. 31.

==Assemblies==
* Have decent number of colonies for all 4 assemblies.
* Barry is screening J45320.J45180.  All others are either wrong (due to pSB1AT3-J45400 being wrong) or pointless at this time.

==Overnights==
*Grew pSB1AT3-J45200 in the wrong media ... Amp-Cm.
*pSB1AC3-J45250/pSB3K3-J45400 didn't grow (either one).
**But the one started on 30th evening is grown up.
*Neither the pSB1AK3-J45180 big or small colonies grew up in culture (reshma)
** One of my 45180 colonies (big) did grow, the other (small) didn't (austin)

==Streak tests==
*pSB1AT3-J45320 grows on Amp-Tet.
*pSB3K3-J45400 grows on Kan.
*pSB1AK3-J45180 grows on Kan.
*<font color=red>pSB1AT3-J45120 grows on Amp-Cm and Amp-Tet.</font>
*<font color=red>pSB1AT3-J45400 grows on Amp-Cm but not Amp-Tet.</font>
** Agrees with my liquid culture results (austin)
** Sent out "1AT3-J45400" for sequencing with VF2/VR (austin)
** Jason clarified.  This construct is totally wrong.  Reverting back to pSB3K3 version.
*pSB1AC3-J45700 grows on Amp-Cm.
*pSB1AC3-J45250 grows on Amp-Cm.
*<font color=red>I got one colony of pSB1AT3-J45200 on an Amp plate.  Maybe slight growth on Tet.</font>

==To do==
* Make electrically competent indole deficient strain (done)
* Determine the best way to screen colonies. Find primers that can be used to determine if parts are in properly.
** For construct J45320.J45180, use pchA mut-f and osmY-r
** For construct J45250.J45400, use ATF1 mut-f and BAT2 mut-r
* Grow up in liquid culture some colonies from each plate during day.  (Barry)
* Miniprep + transform indole(-) strain tonight.  (cancelled)
* Transform J45250 into IK cells.  (Austin and Reshma).
* Ligate and transform J45250.J45400 (from pSB3K3) (Austin and Reshma).
* Grow cultures of (done, Reshma)
