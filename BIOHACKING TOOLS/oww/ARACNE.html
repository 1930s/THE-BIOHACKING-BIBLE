This presentation from the Bio[[MIBLab]] [[Summer 2006 Workshop]] is an [[Summer 2006 Workshop#Analysis|analysis]] bioinformatics tool.

==Synopsis==
Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks

Designed to help understand mammalian normal cell physiology and complex pathologic 
phenotypes through elucidating gene transcriptional regulatory networks.  

==Features==
*Algorithm is robust enough for its application in other network reconstruction problems in biology and the social and engineering fields.
*Pairwise interaction model - higher-order potential interactions will not be accounted for (ARACNE’s algorithm will open 3-gene loops).
*A two-gene interaction will be detected iff there are no alternate paths.
*To keep three-gene loops, modify tolerance for edge-removal by introducing tolerance parameter,                    .
*ARACNE’s performance deteriorates as local (true) network topology deviates from a tree (tight loops may be a problem).
*ARACNE achieved high precision and substantial recall even for few data points when compared to BN and RN (synthetic data). 
*ARACNE cannot predict the orientation of the edges of the networks.
*The algorithm is suited for more complex (mammalian) networks.
