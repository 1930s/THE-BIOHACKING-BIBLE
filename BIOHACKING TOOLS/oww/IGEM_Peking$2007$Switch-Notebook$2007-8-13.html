==inactivate T1TE-pcc010==
using phenol/choloroform to inactivate NotI/XhoI enzyme

rescue by precipitation

==T1T2-pcc010 digestion test==
using SacII and T buffer with BSA in it

==re-PCR lac and SS3==
===lac-T===
primer: lacO3-XhoI-XbaI-F and LacO1-SalI-SpeI-R

===SS3-T===
primer: SS3-XhoI-XbaI-F and SS3-SalI-SpeI-R

electrophoresis result to show that we have got both fragment finally!

gel rescue!

==re-colony PCR of T1TE-plx010==
still not right!

==digestion of T1TE-T1T2-pcc010==
using SacII

==PCR CD1, CD2, RS1-3 and RD1-3==
using different templates and primers for different fragments

result: slight bands for all the fragments, we will see the final result after rescue

==single digestion test for pcc010
using ClaI or SalI(both in H buffer) to test its enzymatic sites

==PCR lacIq using KOD==

buffer 5uL

dNTP 5uL

Mg 2uL

p-f/p-r 1uL each

KOD 1uL

ddH2O 35uL

template toothpick with some colony

94 degrees for 15s, 68 degrees for 30s and 72 degrees for 20s, 30 cycles

==lacI, placI, pSS3 digestion==
