'''Standing Orders'''

In the course of ordering food for lab meetings, it is sometimes tough to contact people to learn their preferred dishes.  Unless you enjoy taking risks in life, add your initials and a default order for each of the following restaurants.  In addition, the [[#Dietary Restrictions|dietary restrictions]] section is available for allergies, moral convictions, health concerns, and finicky eaters.
