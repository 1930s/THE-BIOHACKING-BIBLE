=3D Spatial Programming=
----

'''Problem: '''
How to program 3D spatial structures:
* Is it possible to discover and utilize the proper hierarchy of organization and dynamics to compile global 3D spatial structures through the use of smaller cellular objects?   -->  Biology does it.  Can we learn from developmental biology?

'''Sub-Problems:'''
*What are the levels of abstraction?
*What are the interfaces between the levels of abstraction?



'''Definitions:'''

*Agent = individual cell


==Hierarchy Level II:  Agent Behavioral Primitives==

# replicate (cell division)
# die
# change shape/structure
# crawl
#adhesion to substrates/other cells
#emit chemical signals (diffusible or membrane bound)
#receive chemical signals via receptors; also electrical and mechanical sensors?
#store information (memory)
#process signal and current state information


*'''NOTE: ''' All of the above primitives are accomplished via a lower level of abstraction: biochemical primitives

==Hierarchy Level I:  Biochemical Primitives==

#Gene Regulation
#*Transcription Factors
#**activators
#**inhibitors
#*Chromatin modification ==> global gene accessibility
#**Methylation
#**Acytlation 
#Protein modifications producing ''allosteric structural changes influencing protein function'' (Ex: on/off switch, change functionality)
#*Kinases/Phosphatase (Phosphorylation state)
#*Nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEF's, ATP additions, etc...)
#*Methylation & Acytlation
#Polymerization of identical subunits (Ex: tubulin --> Microtubules)
#Dimerization (homo/hetero-)
#Protein complexes to perform higher level function not capable via single proteins

==Differentiation==

One salient difference between amorphous computing and bio-cellular computing is that biology has devised an elegant hierarchical differentiation scheme to allow specialization and sub-specialization of cell types to distribute functions to a non-homogenous group of agents.  Ultimately we want to meld differentiation into an amorphous-like computing system to utilize the power of hierarchical organization an heterogeneous populations.  


A key component in the process of differentiation in biology is the idea I call a '''decision network'''.  The purpose of a decision network is to perform a computation between communicating cells to determine the fates of the cells involved.  A simple example of a decision network is the Delta-Notch ligand/receptor system found in nearly all organisms that performs a '''lateral inhibition''' role to prevent all cells within a local environment from differentiating into the same cell type.  It is essentially a competition network where one cell ''wins'' and then subsequently ''inhibits'' the losers.  Another decision network example is found in ''Dictyostelium'' prespore/prestalk (Psp/Pst) cell differentiation which is composed of a small negative feedback network acting as a homeostat that robustly produces a particular ratio of Psp/Pst cells (~75/25) within a given colony.  


The utilization and understanding of decision networks are going to be a key interface in ultimately programming cellular differentiation within colonies of similar cells.


I argue that once a cell has made a decision what fate to take on, it wastes no time to act on that decision.  For example, it is generally excepted that once a cell has decided it will commit suicide it will enter a '''fixed-action pattern''' (term stolen from behavioral neuroscience) to follow through to completion.  What good is a half dead cell?  Furthermore in ''Dictyostelium'', once the cells have decided they will enter the social phase of their life, they immediately switch over to a new gene expression state (~25% of gene expression is modulated).  This gene expression modulation occurs many times as the cells proceed with different morphogenetic transformations through development, but maintain a relatively stable gene expression pattern while no morphogenetic transformations are occurring.  If it is true that significant state transitions occur in a crisp, decisive manner then it gives hope that genetic programming may be possible through the interaction of small decision networks and more global gene expression modules.  


If you haven't noticed yet, I have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about and encourage any input/comments via email to:  millard@mit.edu



== Some Principles of Developmental Biology ==
''Original List:''

#'''Life vs. Death'''
#*Cell proliferation (replication)
#**Stem Cells - pleuri-potent cell replacers
#*Cell death (apotosis)
#*NOTE: Need both proliferation and death
#'''Differentiation'''
#*Cells change function and structure in a hierarchical way to build up a complex organism originating from a single cell
#'''Cell morphogenesis'''
#*Cell shape/structure change to facilitate global morphogenesis
#'''Hierarchical Organization'''
#*Cell differentiation results in reduction of cell potential
#*Many possible cell fates all stemming from initial zygote (root of tree)
#'''Induction'''
#*Cell communication that alters/induces cell fates
#*Often times there are inducing centers --> a particular cell or group of cells emitting the induction factor(s)
#*''Community effect'' - if cell placed in certain environment, the cell may be induced to take on same fate as its neighbors
#'''Semi-modularity''' 
#*Sub-division of tasks (tissues and organs), help organize functional units
#*''Boundary formation'' - creates compartments to further order cells
#'''Cell sorting'''
#*Cells can sort into groups of like cells through selective adherence to each other and to the extracellular matrix
# '''Strong Attractor Systems'''
#*Allow fate determination to be relatively stable once arrived
#'''Competency''' 
#*Differential cell abilities to respond to signals due to its current state
#'''Epigenetics'''
#*Chromatin structure and regulation of gene expression --> mechanism for changing competency and differentiation
#'''Combinatorial code of gene expression'''
#* With limited number of genes/signals cells reuse same signals to mean different things given different competencies of cells listening
#'''Maternal factors'''
#*Inherited directly from mother directly from mother cell
#*Inherited regulatory molecules can effect cell fate autonomously without induction (determinants)
#'''Lateral inhibition''' 
#*Neighbors prevented from taking on same fate
#'''Analog to digital conversion through nonlinear thresholding''' 
#*Cells respond differently to the same signal when it is presented at different concentrations (morphogen). 
#*Continuous information contained within a concentration gradient is converted to a discrete outcome through thresholds of activation. 
#'''Cell migration (motility)'''
#*Often regulated by signaling molecules
#'''Cell adhesion'''
#*Cells capable of adhering/pulling on other cells, surfaces, and extracellular matrices through surface proteins
#'''Cell sensing of self and environment'''
#*Senses and interprets chemical, electrical and mechanical signals from other cells and environment
#'''Cellular information processing'''
#Cells process information based self state and environmental state
#'''Morphogenesis'''
#*Taking on 3D form
#*Typically embryos form 3D structures by first forming 2D sheets and subsequently folding
#*3D structure is often required for organ functionality
#'''Genetic pattern formation'''
#*Spatially and temporally regulated differential gene expression
#*Stimulatory vs. Inhibitory signaling  (positive & neg feedback)
#'''Evolution'''
#*Conservation of certain gene functions through evolution (homologs, orthologs)
#'''Cell memory'''
#*Cell has ways of remembering past events by changing its current state based on experience
