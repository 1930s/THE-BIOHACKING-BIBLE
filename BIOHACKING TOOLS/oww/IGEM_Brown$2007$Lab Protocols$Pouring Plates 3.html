For the creation of Agar Plates:


Materials:
  -Distilled Water
  -LB (E. Coli Nutrients)
  -Agar (Gel Substance)
  -Ampicillin

Plan:
  -Make Stock Solution of Ampicillin
   -50 mg ampicillin/mL water
  -Final Solution should be 100ug/mL

Procedure:
 1. Make 10 mL of Stock Solution
     -10 mL * 50 mg/ml= 500mg Ampicillin
 2. Make LB Solution.
     -20g LB/L Water
     -make .5L of LB Solution
        20g/L * .5L= 10g LB.
 3. Agar-LB Solution
     -20g LB/L Water
     -20g Agar/L Water
     -Make .5L Solution
 4. Autoclave in container 1/4 full of solution.
     -Make sure top is covered in aluminum foil.
 5. Let cool to 50 C while stirring.
 6. Add 1 mL stock to each solution.
 7. Make Plates.
