* After purifying the PCR product, add Taq polymerase buffer and dATP to their working concentrations, and 0.5 unit of Taq polymerase. Incubate the reaction for 10-15 minutes at 72Â°C.
* To prepare the cloning reaction combine the following:
** 0.5 to 4 uL PCR product
** 1 uL salt solution
** dilute to a total of 5 uL with water
** 1 uL TOPO vector
* Mix gently and incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes.
* Put the reaction on ice and proceed to the standard TOP10 transformation protocol.
