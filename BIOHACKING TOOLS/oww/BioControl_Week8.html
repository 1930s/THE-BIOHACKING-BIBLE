==Discussion==
It is possible to create in vitro biosynthetic logic circuits utilizing DNA and enzymes. In the next meeting we will overview the basic mechanisms and a few specific examples. Several questions come along when analyzing such systems, such as how to obtain modularity, predictable behaviors and robustness.
