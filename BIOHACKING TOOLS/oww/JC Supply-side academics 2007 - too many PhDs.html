'''Lead: "The number of biology PhDs has increased without a corresponding change in tenure-track positions. This oversupply has led to an intense competition for jobs and funding that may be damaging the culture of science."'''

== key points ==

* number of people with PhD in biology 2x over last 20 years, while tenure track positions constant

* '''effects'''
:* may have led to delays in career progression: average age at first NIH RO1 grant 34y in 1970, 42y in 2006
:* stress and disenchantment of group leader hopefuls: in 2004, 57% of postdocs aimed for tenure-track = twice oversubscribed
:* larger fraction of PhDs to industry: 30% in 2006, 10% in 1970
:* increased competition detrimental for science: less information sharing, less individual examination due to larger number of applicants, reliance on simplified indicators

* '''suggested solutions'''
:* increasing length of scientific training (wasteful and dissatisfying)
:* fewer PhDs or increase of tenure-track jobs
:* new research job category: ''career-track technicians'' as in RIKEN, Japan

Tough but accurate evaluation. Especially, reducing the number of PhDs and postdocs (suggested as a solution by the author) might not be in the interest of group leaders who profit from the cheap labour. -- [[User:Jakob Suckale|Jakob Suckale]] 09:30, 30 October 2007 (CDT)
