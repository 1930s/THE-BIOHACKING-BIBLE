== Poisson Statistics Summary ==

When counting random events that rarely occur, the Poisson distribution is theorized to be the parent distribution describing the probability of obtaining x number of counts for a given unit of time.  I want to test this theory with real data of counts of random events (I assume these events to be detections of cosmic radiation, but I am not sure).  I also want to compare the Poisson distribution to another distribution called the Gaussian distribution for many trials where each trial has a different probability that a count will occur during a unit time.

A large amount of systematic error was present, but I still concluded that the Poisson worked not terribly.  There really isn't too much qualitative stuff for me to report.  But I can report that when the average counts per unit time was small, 0.077(5), the (Poisson Goodness of Fit)/(Gaussian Goodness of Fit) was about 5.  Measuring (Goodness of Fit) was difficult for me, and I could not think of a way to report its uncertainty.
