*WHO's useful data for us includes: incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life years for many diseases broken down by world subregion
**Many are excel files
**But all are scattered
*I emailed the regional information officer regarding the possibility of gaining direct access to their database via download or biopython
*Zach is working on OMIM keywords -> ICD9, California incidence numbers
**With WHO, this can be carried out on a much larger scale 
**Is there great relevance in using the ICD system?  It seems like this is an endpoint, so I'm not sure what else we'd do with these..
