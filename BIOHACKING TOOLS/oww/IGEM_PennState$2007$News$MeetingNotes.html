Monday, May 21-Group Meeting in 244 Ag Engineering 3PM
More information about the meetings below.
If times do not work, please let me know and we can reschedule them to a better time.
Also, if anyone has a copy of the Genetic Switch and would like to lend it out to one of our 3 new members please let me know, and I will get it to one of them as quickly as possible.

At the Student Meeting
<h2>Friday, May 18-Student Meeting at 408 Althouse 2PM</h2>
We went over:
*using the spectrophotometer
*locations of lab supplies
*general lab strategies
*planned brainstorming session

<h2>Monday, May 21-Group Meeting in 244 Ag Engineering 3PM</h2>
Summer Schedule

<h2>Monday, May 30-Group Meeting in 244 Ag Engineering 4PM</h2>
Todays Topic: Project Propoasals
*Friday is decision deadline
Suggestions: Focus on areas under advisors expertise, focus on iGEM objectives (Energy, Fuel)
iGEM objectives for 2007
*Health and Medicine
*Energy and Environment
*Parts and Devices

Project Proposals
*Radiation Biosensor
*Heat Biosensor
**Exothermic Enzymes
*Biofilms
**Tom Richards: Applications to Synthetic Biology
*Renewable Energy Biomass: 
**Problem is Multiple Sugar  Types
***Diauxie
***Remove Diauxie by modifying bacteria to remove both sugars at the same time.

<h2>Saturday, June 2-Undergraduate Online Meeting 4PM</h2>
*What is the composition of the biomass (sugars x%)?
*Is there a biomass standard
*How do we knock the xylose metabolism parts out of the chromosome
*Put xyl A, B, E under control of xylR
*Do we we want the xylose metabolism to be under tight repression?
*Should we be looking at multiple sugar metabolizing pathways?
Plan:
*Noah/Garrett-look up biomass papers come up with questions
*Luc-come up with weekly plan

<h2>Sunday, June 3-Undergraduate Meeting HUB 12PM</h2>
<h2>Monday, June 4-Group Meeting in 244 Ag Engineering 4PM</h2>
*Biobrick-ing
**Just need to order primers, will have biobricks on them
**Have to add a silent mutation to use restriction enzymes on so that you dont accidentally cut the gene
**Should probably make 2 separate biobricks:
***1) All the way from xylF to just before xylA starts
***2) Smaller one: remove crp binding site, possibly put in a spacer to preserve looping mechanism
****This might be a pain to PCR: might want to order it if we go that route
*Diauxie Project
**Use xylE instead of xylF,G,H (smaller and easier to work with)
**Ptac = mixture of lac and trp
**If xylR acts like araC we need to keep an upstream area to allow it to loop correctly (~200bp)
**Fis? - Noone knew how it worked or if its necessary... found short [http://parts.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/Relax_before_you_read_this_answer description from 2006 iGEM], also paper describing Fis listed on ANGEL under Diauxie
**NAD+ Chromosomal deletion- good idea, research further
**Biomass- Glucose and Xylose are ~80-90%
**Don't need to worry about repressing crp because majority of dimers will be crp* so the overwhelming concentration will factor out crp
*Dosimeter Project
**Currently a UV lysing component is used on plasmids
***Does it use recA? ...should look into it
**Part BBa R0011 - Lambda switch
**Could consider biobrick-ing recA
*Next Steps:
**Biobrick xylR first separately, biobrick other components mentioned
**Look into cloning software (CloneManager), If not possible to get on Richard Lab computers we can use Dr. Cirino's computers in his lab sometime
**Order DNA synthesis soon
**Research feasibility of dosimeter
**Continue researching diauxie project.. Dr. C will send more papers
