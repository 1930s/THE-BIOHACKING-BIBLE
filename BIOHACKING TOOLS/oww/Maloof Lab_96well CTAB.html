<h3><font style="color:#F8B603;">96-Well Format DNA Extraction with CTAB</font></h3>
----
#Add a single ball bearing to each 1.2 ml tube containing tissue.  (This can be done by using a sealing mat with 96 indentations and sprinkling the ball bearings over the top).  Put samples into liquid nitrogen.
#Disrupt tissue by shaking with paint shaker for 2 min.  Repeat if clumps of tissue remain.
#Centrifuge briefly to bring down tissue dust.
#Add 300 ul CTAB, place sealing mat loosely on top of plate and heat at 65°C in water bath for 30 min. (optional)
#Let cool to room temperature.
#Centrifuge briefly and add 300 ul chloroform (done in hood).  Use a TIP BOX lid for chloroform; it melts the boats!  Seal tightly with the sealing mat and vortex vigorously for 10-20 seconds.  Or use the mix step on the Apricot.
#Centrifuge at 3250 rpm for 15 min.
#During centrifugation, prepare 96-well deep well plates by adding 200 ul isopropyl alcohol to each well.
#Transfer 200 μl of the chloroform-extracted supernatant to the new plates.  Be very careful not to transfer any of the goop from the interface, or any of the organic layer.
#Cover the tubes with the sealing mat and centrifuge at 3250 rpm for 15 min.
#Pour off the liquid into the sink; the pellet of DNA should stay behind.
#Wash with 200 μl of 70% ethanol, re-cover the tubes and centrifuge for 7-10 min. at 3250 rpm.
#Dump off the liquid again and blot the plates dry on paper towels.  Cover the plates with a kimwipe and let them air dry for >3 hours (or until no liquid can be seen inside and the tubes don’t smell like ethanol).
#Resuspend the pellets in 100 ul of TE and let sit for >3 hours at 4°C (I usually leave them overnight).  The DNA can then be transferred to skirted 96-well PCR plates for storage.
#Use 0.5 μl in a 10 μl PCR reaction.
