==S01656 Testing==
*Measure OD of cultures
**+IPTG = 1.735
**-IPTG = 0.298 (lack of oxygen in culture, since cultured 50 mL in 50 mL Falcon tube)
*Dilute down to OD 0.1 in 5 mL LB Kanamycin
*Start shake at 9:25
*Measure OD of cultures again
**+IPTG = 0.389
**-IPTG = 0.390
*Dilute down to OD 0.1 in 5 mL LB (no antibiotic)
*Start shake at 11:40
*Measure OD of T9002
**OD = 0.374
*Spun down S01656 cultures, put into T9002, placed into 96 well plate
*Start shake at 14:07

==J37015 + J37015 RS Testing==

*Inoculated fresh day cultures at 9.40 am


==T9002 & J37016 Testing==
*Measurement of OD in the morning: 
**T9002: 0.549
**J37016: 0.676
*Dilution to OD 0.1 & put in shaker at 9:45 am
*Measurement of OD after 2h in shaker: 
**T9002: 0.359
**J37015: 0.433
*Dilution to OD 0.1 again - then transferring solutions with appropriate concentration of AHL respectively into 96 well plate
*Put in shaker at 12:30 pm (set shaker to 100rev/min otherwise platees might get contaminated)
*After 4:45 h took plates out of shaker and read fluorescence with Wallac Victor III

==LoxP PCR==

*Inconclusive results - further tests tomorrow
*The problem that we have is that the amplified bands are of a very similar size to that of the oligonucleotides, and therefore distinguishing them is proving difficult.
*We are altering the compositions of the gels as a consequence.

==Storing Bacteria==

*Following the MIT [http://openwetware.org/wiki/Endy:Making_a_long_term_stock_of_bacteria protocol] S01656, T9002, J37016, J37015 & J37015RS have been stored in the -80C freezer. (They were stored with an initial OD of 0.5)
