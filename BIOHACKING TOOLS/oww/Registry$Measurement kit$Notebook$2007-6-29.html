==To do==
#Colony PCR of promoter tester (We got 3 colonies (1AT3))
#Re-try colony PCR of RBS tester
#Run them on a gel
#MfeI/NsiI digest of E0240
#PCR cleanup E0240
#Ligate E0240 and 3K3, transform

==Colony PCR==
*Trying extension time of 1:45, in case 1:30 was too short
*Made new dNTP dilution (108 H2O + 3 of each NTP)

==Analytic Gel==
*Loading bottom row:
*Lanes 1-5 and 16-20 empty or ladder; lanes 6-12 rbs tester; lanes 13-15 promoter tester.

==Digest==
*Can't digest with both enzymes concurrently according to NEB, so cutting with MfeI first
