Cheap non-kit plasmid miniprep:

# take 1.8 ml from an overnight culture into a 2 ml centrifuge tube, spin down 1 minute at full speed, and discard the medium
# resuspend the bacterial pellet by vortexing with 100 ul of chilled (4C) GET solution
# lyse the bacteria by adding 200 ul of room temperature  alkaline SDS, not longer than 5 minutes.   Invert to mix: do not vortex.  The solution should become clear.
# precipitate proteins, membranes, and chromosomal DNA with 150 ul chilled (4C) potassium acetate solution, mix by inverting gently.
# centrifuge at full speed 5 to 10 min
# transfer 400 ul of the clean supernatant into a new tube preloaded with 900 ul of 100% EtOH to precipitate the plasmid DNA
# place the tubes in the -80 freezer for 30 minutes
# centrifuge the precipitated plasmid DNA 10 to 15 minutes at full speed, and discard supernatant
# optional: wash the pellet with 70% EtOH, respin and discard the supernatant
# air dry the pellet for 10-15 minutes at room temperature with the open tube on the bench
# resuspend the plasmid DNA in 20 ul of TE.  The DNA will contain RNA contamination, which can be removed by resuspending in TE with RNAse.
