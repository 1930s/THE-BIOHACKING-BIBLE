== Midiprep ==
3 midipreps: 011 (J04500 + KaiB), 010 + 012 (J04500 + KaiA + J04500 + KaiC), B00015 (terminator)
 
First two had succesful nanodrops (~60 and 90 ng/uL respectively), but B00015 did not turn out (flatline).
 
A fourth midiprep, of Geneart KaiB, is going extremely slowly. Right now it's on the first QC wash of step 11 in the Qiagen manual.
 
== Digest ==
16 digests of 011\SP. Digesting for 3h at 45C in PCR-5 (imaging room). The digest should be finished at 7:20PM.
 
=== Reaction ===
* 7.6 uL DNA
* 1 uL 10x BSA
* 1 uL NEBuffer 2
* 0.2 uL SpeI
* 0.2 uL PstI


==CIP'd vectors==
Left set of 8 in freezer

==Run on gel and gel extract==

=( Bad results.... poststained, etc...

==Diagnostic digest==

50min digest @45. Lanes in the below gel

*1: 1kb+
*2: "11" undig
*3: "11" /xp
*4: "11" /sp jeff
*5: "11" /sp
*6: "22" undig
*7: "22" /sp
*8: "22" /xp
*9: 1kb+

Note the quotes signify the old labeling. If you look carefully there is 500bp insertin lane 8, and 2 3000 bp fragments in lane 3; so the labeling was switched.
