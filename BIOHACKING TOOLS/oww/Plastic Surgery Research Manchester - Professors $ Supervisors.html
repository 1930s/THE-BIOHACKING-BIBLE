My initial exposure to research was a project on the process of wound healing as a first year medical student at UCL in London supervised by Professor Gus McGrouther. This small study encouraged me to do a one year project on the same topic as part of an intercalated BSc in Anatomy. During my basic surgical training, I worked on a number of clinical projects; however, it was not until completion of basic surgical training that I had the opportunity to continue with basic scientific research. Having completed a one year research fellowship from the Royal College of Surgeons of England, I subsequently gained an MRC clinical training fellowship. This award led to a successful PhD in molecular genetics of scar formation at the University of Manchester under the supervision of professors Mark Ferguson and Bill Ollier. I then began my specialist training in Plastic Surgery. I have presented at many national and international scientific/clinical conferences, given invited talks, contributed chapters to books and published extensively in peer reviewed journals. I am a grant reviewer for research councils, peer reviewer for more than 20 journals and serve on the editorial board of the Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery. I have filed seven patents in novel genes & new surgical devices. 

Since completion of my PhD, I have continued to maintain an active research interest as a lecturer and was successful in achieving a clinician scientist award in 2006 in plastic & reconstructive surgery research. Over the past few years, I have supervised numerous students who have successfully completed their research, given oral presentations in national and international meetings as well as published in peer reviewed scientific literature. There are now 28 individuals in my group comprising of post docs, PhDs, MD, MSc, MRes and project and elective medical students. I am currently based at the MIB (Manchester Interdisciplinary Biocentre) [http://www.mib.ac.uk Link MIB website]. My international collaborators are from The USA (Massachusetts and California), Australia (Perth & Sydney), Europe (Germany and Sweden), Middle East (Saudi Arabia), Africa (Sudan) and Asia (Malaysia).

Research Focus

My main interest is in skin biology and tissue fibrosis; areas of current research include skin scarring, fibrosis, and infection. The objective of my research is to elucidate fundamental mechanisms in wound healing, wound infection and tissue fibrosis and to use this knowledge of new therapeutic targets and biomarkers to develop novel therapies particularly in detection, prevention and treatment of abnormal wound healing, wound infection and fibrotic disorders.
