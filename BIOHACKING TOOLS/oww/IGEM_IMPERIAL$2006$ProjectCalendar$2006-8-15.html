==Modelling==

The document for the individual test constructs has been completed. The link to the document can be found under [http://openwetware.org/wiki/IGEM:IMPERIAL/2006/project/Oscillator/Modelling modelling] on the main page. Tommorrow, we'll input realistic values into the simulation on cell designer and compile a model for the overall system.

==Biosensor==

Quick meeting scheduled with Anna tomorrow at 11am to finally make a decision on the biosensor.
