Witnessing Fluoroscein diffuse into e.coli attempt#3 sort of worked.
I've uploaded a Fluorescent image of each concentration I ran - 0M, 0.5uM, 5uM, 50uM, 500uM. 

Results show fluorescene - 
I can't explain if the apparent change in contrast between pictures is a function of my inexperience or some deeper meaning in the pictures...
