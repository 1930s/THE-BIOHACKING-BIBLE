Police want detail there, though there are only an estimated 100 people attending. For the form I said that there were TIPS trained grad students who would be attending the bar.

==Music, decorations, etc.==
#need to decide theme - [http://orientaltrading.com Oriental Trading] has inexpensive event decorations
#Call A-V, ask for stereo to RCA adaptor, possibly amplifier, depending on Morss Hall's setup



We'll need volunteers to bartend (who are trained), someone at the door to check IDs (attentively, as there will be campus police there), and possibly people to help with serving food -- it's listed as Banquet style, but we didn't pay the caterer to stay and serve food. We could also try to get it changed to "buffet style."

#donut  <- what does this mean? - it usually means a toroid pastry or eating said pastry while it is suspended from a string
#pie-eating context (whipped cream?)
