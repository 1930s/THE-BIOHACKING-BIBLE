= Notes on <cite>Simpson-TrendsBiotechnol-19-2001</cite> =

* complex tasks performed by cells: sensing, navigation, communication, cooperation, nano-fabrication
* review on mimicing man-made information processing inside cells
* to accomplish tasks, need memory, sensing, feedback, communication
* E. coli - 2 micrometer^2 cross section - 4.6 x 10^6 bp chromosome - equiv 9.2 megabit memory
** how arrive at this number?
** 4300 diff polypeptides produced from several hundred diff promoters
* compare to semiconductors [http://www.sematech.org International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors]
** by 2014, memory density 24.5 Gbits/cm^2 and logic transistor density 664 M/cm^2
*** assuming 4 transistors per logic function (how get this?), 2 micrometer^2 Si could contain 490-bit memory with 3 simple logic gates
* bacterial cells, viewed as 'devices' - tolerate a wide array of conditions
* can integrate them in 3D structures
* biofilm formation an alternative to lithography and other manufacturing techniques neccesary for Si integrated circuits
* BBIC - bioluminescent bioreporter integrated circuit (4-8)
* present 3 examples of sensing/information processing/actuation that occurs in natural cells
*# directed motility (chemotaxis, phototaxis, magnetotaxis (12-14))
*# symbiotic collonization as a communications system, esp. to initially establish the relationship
*#* Hawaiian squid Euprymna scolopes with lumincescent Vibrio fisheri (24)
*#** Upon colonization V. fischeri looses flagella, reduces cell size, decreases growth rate, enhances luminescence (25,26)
*# group formation (biofilms) - members have some protection from phage, biocides, antibiotics
* 'silicon mimetic' approach to engineering cell information processing
** engineered genetic regulatory functions emulate the functionality of silicon semiconductor devices
** silicon paradigm - three terminal device in which transport between 2 of the terminals controlled by a signal at the third ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_effect_transistor FET])
*** biochemical analogy - substrate-enzyme-product controlled by some effector acting on the enzyme (bipolar junction transistor) (32,33)
**** hardware interconnects not needed
*** Fig 2 shows the lux system in V. fischerei used in the BBIC that implements this design - control of light production by O2 and FMNH2 modulation of luciferase activity
** realizing logic gates with genetic machinery
*** the key to logic gates is interconnectivity
*** constructing gene transcription modules for biochemical devices that are logic circuits (Knight's group - 9,10)
*** this group working on AND, OR and XOR
*** implementing OR
***# use 2 promoters that behave same as transcription factors, but are affected by 2 diff effectors
***# use 1 promoter that respots same way to 2 diff inhibitors - tod-lux fusion in P. putida TVA8 (induced by trichloroethylene and toluene)
*** '''combinations of AND, OR and XOR can implement any combinatorial logic function - but CANNOT be used for sequential circuits that require memory of past logic states and clock signal synchronization'''
*** Gardner, Cantor, Collins - one-bit memory using double repressor toggle switch (uses lamba cI and part of Lac operon -  ('Construction of a Genetic toggle switch in E. coli' 35) (see also <cite>Kobayashi-PNAS-101-2004</cite>)
*** 'challenge - develop genetic circuit that makes more eff use of cells DNA memory capacity'''
*** Elowitz and Liebler repressilator can be used as clock (36) (why not also cell cycle?)
** interconnecting
*** needed for even moderate complexity
*** suggest using cell-to-cell signals to connect - isolating single gate inside a cell
*** quorum sensing via N-acyl-homoseine lactones (AHLs) - diffusable cell-to-cell signals present in many Gram-negative bacteria (37)
*** V. fischeri - luxI encodes AHL synthetase, luxR encodes AHL-dependant transcriptional activator
*** primary consideration is number of molecules in circuits and the amoun of cross-talk
**** (39) - P. aeruginosa and V. fischerei AHL systems don't interact
** Input/Output
*** review on EMF and electric current pulses in living cells (43) - little data on how effects gene expression - need to know this for hybrid systems - Fig 6 describes their experiment towars this investigation
** noise
*** finite period of time necc for an effector to reach operational concentration, certain time needed for it to decay below operational concentration as well
*** outcomes of genetic networks not deterministic (44,45)
**** problem for non-linear circuits with bifurcations since can cause non-boolean, probabilistic responses
*** simulating such circuits - Gillespi algorithm - see Adam's paper on Bio-SPICE (48)
