==Overview==
The first tube produces cDNA from an RNA sample <cite>MeasuringGeneExpression</cite>.  The cDNA can either be produced using a single sequence-specific reverse transcription primer designed to anneal only to the transcript of interest or using reverse transcription primers that anneal to all RNA molecules.  The reaction is stopped by heating and an aliquot is taken to serve as the template for a sequence specific [[qPCR]] step.
