Green Living @MIT
   A pr campaign to try and make people think about sustainability at a time other than Earth Day. We are making posters and             having a variety of events.
           Events:
                   Shopping Green @MIT!

                       We are hoping to bring in a local expert on sustainability to give a brief and informal lecture about where to shop                             around here and also what are the dos and donts of buying. We'll also talk about food!
