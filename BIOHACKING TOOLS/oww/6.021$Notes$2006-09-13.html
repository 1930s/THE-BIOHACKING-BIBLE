==Diffusion==
* Non-linear relationship between space and time is ''non-intuitive''

===Diffusion applied to cells===
* Membrane diffusion
* The membrane is around 10nm whereas the cell is about 10&mu;m
* Can treat as 1D diffusion (diffusion across membrane ignoring other dimension)
* Reference direction for flux: positive is out of cell

===Dissolve and Diffuse model===
# solute outside dissolves into membrane
# solute diffuses through membrane
# solute dissolves into cytoplasm
# concentration of solute in cell increases

* Assume dissolving is faster than diffusion (assume dissolving is instant)
* <math>c_n^i</math>: concentration inside of solute
* <math>c_n^o</math>: concentration outside of solute

===Dissolve model===
* Membrane is like oil, cytoplasm and outside bath is like water
* Some solutes like oil, some like water
* Find relative solubilities of solute n in oil and water
* Partition coefficient <math>k_{oil:water}=\frac{c_n^{oil}}{c_n^{water}}</math> (at equilibrium)

===Diffusion in membrane===
* Difficult to solve analytically but numerically easy
* From point of view of membrane, both inside and outside baths are constant
* If wait long enough (reach equilibrium), the concentration will become flat in membrane
* But short term, will be a straight line
* How long to straight line?
** Membrane width d
** Can estimate it. For half of particles to cross membrane is <math>t=d^2/D</math> but this is overestimate as don't need that many particles to cross membrane. For midway is <math>t=d^2/(4D)</math>
** Exact solution: <math>\tau_{ss}=\frac{d^2}{\pi^2 D}</math> (steady state time constant for membrane)

===Solute enters cell===
*<math>\phi_n(t)=P_n(c_n^i(t)-c_n^o(t)), P_n=\frac{D_nk_n}{d}</math>
* <math>P_n</math>: permeability of membrane to solute n
* concentration in cell changes: 2 compartment diffusion
* assume volumes constant, baths are well-stirred, membrane is thin (ignore solute in membrane), and membranes always in steady state
* <math>c_n^i(t)V_i + c_n^o(t)V_o = N_n</math> (total amount of solute is conserved)
* <math>\phi_n(t)=P_n(c_n^i(t)-c_n^o(t))</math>
* Solution to equations: <math>c_n^i(t)=c_n^i(\infty)+(c_n^i(0)-c_n^i(\infty))e^{-t/\tau_{eq}}</math>
* <math>c_n^i(\infty) = \frac{N_n}{V_i+V_o}, \tau_{eq}=\frac{1}{AP(1/V_i+1/V_o)}</math>

===Check assumption dissolving is fast===
* 2 time constants
* <math>\tau_{ss}=\frac{d^2}{\pi^2 D}, \tau_{eq}=\frac{1}{AP(1/V_i+1/V_o)}</math>
* For cell <math>V_o\gg V_i</math> so <math>\tau_{eq}=\frac{V_i}{AP}</math>
* Assume spherical cell, <math>r=10\mu{\rm m}, d=10{\rm nm}, k=1</math>
* <math>\frac{\tau_{eq}}{\tau_{ss}}=\frac{V_i}{AP}\frac{\pi^2D}{d^2} \approx 3\frac{r}{d} \approx 10^3</math>
* Assumption that <math>\tau_{eq} \gg \tau_{ss}</math> is ok
