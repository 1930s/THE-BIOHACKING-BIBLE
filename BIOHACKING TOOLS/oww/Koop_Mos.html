I am a former graduate student of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans [http://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/sci/osap/people/ross/ross_e.htm (Institute of Ocean Sciences)] and the [[koop|Koop lab]] in the [http://web.uvic.ca/cbr/ Centre for Biomedical Research] at the [http://www.uvic.ca University of Victoria]. My project focussed on the development and application of physiological and molecular biomarkers of environmental contaminant-associated toxicity in harbour seals. 

Currently, I am working as a Toxicologist for [http://www.hemmera.com Hemmera], a Western Canadian environmental consulting company. Hemmera carries out human health and ecological risk assessments in contaminated sites as well as remote areas. As collaborative research projects between Hemmera and the Koop lab, I am also doing some laboratory work for investigations of the impacts of oil spills and other environmental concerns on fish health.
