#Add appropriate amount of deionized H<sub>2</sub>O to sterile 0.6 mL tube
#Add 1 &mu;L ligation buffer to the tube.  <br>Vortex buffer before pipetting to ensure that it is well-mixed. <br>Remember that the buffer contains ATP so repeated freeze, thaw cycles can degrade the ATP thereby decreasing the efficiency of ligation.
#Add appropriate amount of insert to the tube.
#Add appropriate amount of vector to the tube.
#Add 0.5 &mu;L ligase. <br>Vortex ligase before pipetting to ensure that it is well-mixed.  <br>Also, the ligase, like most enzymes, is in some percentage of glycerol which tends to stick to the sides of your tip.  To ensure you add only 1 &mu;L, just touch your tip to the surface of the liquid when pipetting.
#Let the 10 &mu;L solution sit at 22.5&deg;C for 30 mins
#Denature the ligase at 65&deg;C for 10min
#Dialyze for 20 minutes if electroporating
#Use disks shiny side up
#Store at -20&deg;C
