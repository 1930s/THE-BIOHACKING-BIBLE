==Overview of Modelling ==

Welcome to our portal page for the modelling of Cell By Date

Cell by date tries to improve on printed cell by date as acting as a thermal exposure device, exploiting the thermal dependance of the rate of expression of a simple reporter system.  We are looking at a variety of constructs to realise this behaviour.

===Constructs to be Used ===

{|
|-
|GFP Based
|[[IMAGE:ICGEMS_dvc_Ptet_gfp.png|left|frame]]
|[[IMAGE:ICGEMS_dvc_PT7_gfp.png|left|frame]]
|[[IMAGE:PcI_construct.PNG|left|frame]]
|-
|RFP Based
|[[IMAGE:ICGEMS_dvc_Ptet_rfp.PNG|left|frame]]
|[[IMAGE:ICGEMS_dvc_PT7_rfp.PNG|left|frame]]
|[[IMAGE:ICGEMS_dvc_PcI_rfp.PNG|left|frame]]
|-
|}

As can be seen in the above table all of our constructs have the same general form of a promoter upstream of a reporter.  Looking at the rate of Fluorescent Protein (FP) produced :

<math>\frac{d[FP]}{dt}=k_{FP}(t)-d_{FP}[FP] </math>

# kFP : Function of Temperature.  k is based on the promoter used as promoters take time to turn on.
# dFP : Function of System.  May be considered to be a function of temperature as proteins degrade faster at higher temperatures.
