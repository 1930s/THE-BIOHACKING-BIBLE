* '''Strain:'''  MG1655(seq)
* '''Genotype:''' See [http://cgsc.biology.yale.edu:80/cgi-bin/sybgw/cgsc/Strain/68076 CGSC#7740]
* '''Phenotype:'''
* '''Date:'''  September 29, 2005
* '''Experimenter:''' Francois St-Pierre
* '''Strain obtained from:''' E.coli Genetic Stock Center (CGSC). CGSC#7740, Source person = M.S.Guyer (choice 1)
* '''Stock preparation:''' The stock came as a few drops of a glycerolized culture placed on a filter disc. The filter disc was placed on a LB plate and ~200ul of LB was added on the filter to humidify it. A sterile loop (or toothpick), after touching the liquid, was used to streak on the same plate. The plate was incubated at 37C. A single colony was then grown in LB at 30C until it just reached late log phase - early saturation (OD600~2.3). Glycerol stocks were made by mixing 1ml of culture with 1ml of 40% glycerol, vortexing, and storing at -85C.
* '''Physical location of the stock:'''
** [[User:Stpierre|Francois St-Pierre]]'s stocks: 4 vials in box "Francois's Ecoli 1"  (as of Oct3,2005). ID#: FSP B4
