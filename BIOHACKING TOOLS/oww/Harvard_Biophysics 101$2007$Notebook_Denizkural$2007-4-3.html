I've written a script to get the latest news for the keywords provided by OMIM results, I've put them up on a cgi-enabled webserver at Harvard. Note that what is at the top "Biology News Feed" is completely my doing and can be removed/changed.

http://people.fas.harvard.edu/~kural/vert.cgi?keyword=colon%20cancer
http://people.fas.harvard.edu/~kural/vert.cgi?keyword=leukemia
http://people.fas.harvard.edu/~kural/vert.cgi?keyword=macular%20degeneration

Also, for a different, less invasive news style:

http://people.fas.harvard.edu/~kural/horiz.cgi?keyword=HIV
http://people.fas.harvard.edu/~kural/horiz.cgi?keyword=Herceptin
http://people.fas.harvard.edu/~kural/horiz.cgi?keyword=Gleevec


It is also possible to directly put the keywords in the script, it is just a variable.

Note that I didn't use RSS. I will show how to do this with Python and RSS/Atom as well.
