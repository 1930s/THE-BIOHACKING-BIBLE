==Microfluidics project==
* Sign up for time slot for pre-lab
* Need to first find a partner. Recommended to find partner with a different background

==Office hours==
* Open office hours 32-044 Tues. 4-10pm and Wed. 4-7pm

==Diffusion==
* Fick's first law ([[../2006-09-08/|Review]]) only provides information at one time
* need something to go from <math>t</math> to <math>t+\Delta t</math>
*Continuity equation
** Conservation of mass
**<math>-\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial c}{\partial t}</math>
** A change in flux in space implies change in concentration over time
* Combining Fick's first law and continuity equation:
**<math>\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial x} = -\frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = -D\frac{\partial^2 c}{\partial x^2}</math>
* This is the '''diffusion equation''' (Fick's Second law)
**<math>\frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = D\frac{\partial^2 c}{\partial x^2}</math>

===Steady State Solution===
* '''Steady state''': <math>\frac{\partial}{\partial t} = 0</math> for everything (nothing changes with time)
* '''Equilibrium''': Steady state AND all fluxes are 0
* In a closed system, equilibrum is equivalent to steady state
* In an open system, we can have non-zero fluxes at steady state
** Flux can be a constant (non-zero) which implies that concentration is a linear function of <math>x</math>

===Dynamics===
* Simplest case is to assume infinite space and a point source with 1-dimensional diffusion
* Dirac delta function <math>\delta(x)</math>
* <math>\delta(x) = 0</math> except at <math>x=0</math> and <math>\int_{-\infty}^\infty \delta(x)dx = 1</math>
* Suppose at time 0, <math>c(x,t)=n_0\delta(x)</math> where <math>n_0</math> is the initial amount
** Solution of diffusion equation in this case:
** <math>c(x,t)=\frac{n_0}{\sqrt{4\pi Dt}}e^{-x^2/(4Dt)}</math>
** Compare with Gaussian function: <math>\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-(x-\mu)^2/(2\sigma^2)}</math>
** We see that solution is Gaussian with a time-dependent standard deviation <math>\sigma=\sqrt{2Dt}</math> (and mean of 0)
** At any point in space, the concentration increases then decreases
** The amount of time it takes for half the solute to diffuse <math>x_{1/2}</math> is <math>t_{1/2}\approx\frac{x_{1/2}^2}{D}</math>
** ''This squared relationship between time and distance is a very important characteristic of diffusion.''
** Example of this scaling effect
*** <math>D=10^{-5}{\rm cm}^2/{\rm s}</math>
*** For <math>x_{1/2}=10</math>mm, <math>t_{1/2}=10^5</math>s (about a day)
*** For <math>x_{1/2}=10 \mu</math>m, <math>t_{1/2}=0.1</math>s
*** For <math>x_{1/2}=10</math>nm, <math>t_{1/2}=0.1\mu</math>s
*** ''Diffusion on cell length scales is really fast AND diffusion over macroscopic timescales is really slow''
