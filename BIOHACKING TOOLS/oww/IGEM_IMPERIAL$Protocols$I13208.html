==Part I13208: AiiA Enzyme Test==

===Motivation===

The motivation behind testing this to part is to test the Zinc Hypothesis, and to test qualitatively if AiiA is hydrolysing AHL.

===Materials & Equipment===

*Equipment
**Wallac Victor 3 Multi-Well Fluorimeter
**Ependorf Tubes
**Gilson Pippettes
**37oC Shaker

*Materials
**AHL
**GFP Standard Solution
**E.coli Growth Medium w/Ampicilin (LB/M9)
**E.coli DH5a Culture Containing I13208

===Protocol===

*Inoculate two cultures each from 10ul of stored I13208 in 2ml of both LB and M9 growth medium containing 50ug/ml Ampicilin.
*Incubate at 37oC for overnight in a shaker.
*Following day, prewarm LB/M9 to 37oC by placing in the 37oC incubator
*Measure and record OD600_1 in report sheet
*Inoculate a 2ml fresh culture from the o/n to bring back the OD600 to 0.1, use prewarmed LB/M9 + Ampicilin.
** Volume used to inoculate new culture = (0.1/OD600_1)*2ml
*Return LB/M9 to incubator
*Incubate new cultures at 37oC for 2 hours in a shaker - '''<font color = green>This returns cells to exponential phase</font>'''
*Measure and record the OD600_2 in report sheet
*Dilute again for an OD of 0.1 in a new culture of 10ml of a prewarmed LB/M9 + Ampicilin.
**Volume used to inoculate new culture = (0.1/OD600_2)*10ml
*Vortex new I13208 cultures.
*Pipette 990{{ul}} of each of the two cultures into 4 labelled ependorf tubes
