==Cleaning etc==
*PCR cleaned all overnight digests - CCDB-E/X, CCDB-S/X, I2055-M/N, 3K3-E/P, 1AK3-E/P, 1AK3-E/X
*Minipreped 3K3 to have a DNA stock
*Made new Measurement Kit Primers box for the -20

==I2055==
*Ran gel of overnight col pcr's
*Only colony # 17 looks good
*Overnighted I2055-3K3 #17
*Ligated newly digested I2055 into the newly digested plasmids
**Ligated I2055-3K3, I2055-1AK3
*Transformed 3ul ligation and plated



==I2056==
*Overnight transformation plate had no colonies
*Ligated I2056-1AK3, I2056-3K3 w/ newly digested plasmids
*Transformed and plated

==E0240==

[[Image:07.07.26-2.jpg|thumb|left|BB PCR Gel]]
*Ligated E0240-1AK3
*Transformed and plated
*Set up 100ul BB PCR's of E0240-3K3 E/X and E0240-3K3 E/S at  52
*Ran gel of BB PCR, both look good (1st 2 bands after ladder)
*PCR cleaned both E0240-3K3-X and E0240-3K3-S
*Digested both BB PCRs w/ Not1 in buffer 3 overnight

==I2057==
*Ligated I2057-1AK3, transformed and plated
*BB PCRed I2057-3K3 E/X and I2057-3K3 E/S at 52
*Ran gel of BB PCR - both looked good (2 farthest right samples)
*PCR cleaned both BB pcr's
*Digest both w/ Not1 in buffer 3 overnight

==T9002==
*Overnight plates of T9002-1AK3 and T9002-3K3 have 4 colonies each
**Set up 10ul Col PCR's  
*Ligated F2620-1AK3 w/ new plasmid, transformed and plated
*Ran out of cut F2620
**Digesting F2620 - M/X in buffer 4 overnight
