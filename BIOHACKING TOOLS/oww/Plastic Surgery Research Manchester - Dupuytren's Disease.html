Dupuytren's disease (DD) affects human hands by producing hard fibrotic lumps in the palmar tissue causing bending of the fingers, with loss of function, discomfort, reduced quality of life and deformity of the hand. DD finally leads to an irreversible, permanent and progressive flexion contracture of the involved digits. It commonly affects both hands and can also occur over the knuckles, feet and penis (also known as Peyronies disease). There is a high familial predisposition and in excess of 25% of Northern Europeans over 50 years develop evidence of this condition. DD is considered to be one of the most common heritable disorders of connective tissue in Caucasians. The distress is made worse by the fact that all current methods of treatment like surgery have possible complications and recurrence of the disease.
