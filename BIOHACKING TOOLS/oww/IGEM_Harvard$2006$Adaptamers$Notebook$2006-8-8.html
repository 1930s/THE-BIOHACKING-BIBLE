==8/8==

Experiments:

1) Speed Vac

2) thrombin beads

*1.Speed Vac
Take remaining fraction of 8/6 elutions (theoretically 144 of 152 uL) and concentrate using the speed vac, then run on gel and stain with SYBR gold.

S0: streptavidin aptamer (40 bp single stranded)
SB: streptavidin beads
TB: thrombin beads

1: ladder

2: 20 pmol S0

3: 10 uL SB + 40 pmol S0

4: 25 uL SB + 40 pmol S0

5: 50 uL SB + 40 pmol S0

6: 100 uL SB + 40 pmol S0

7: 150 uL SB + 40 pmol S0

8: T35 (50bp, single stranded oligo)

9: 150uL TB + 40 pmol S0

The bands are a bit brighter, now (same imager settings). The 100uL sample has very little in it: enough beads were in this sample so that they precipitated following concentration and it was only possible to add a tiny bit of fluid.

*2.Thrombin Beads

Repeat 8/6 experiment with thrombin beads. Slightly higher concentration of T0 will be used. Thrombin concentration (of beads) is unclear, but we'll just try different volumes.

Both gels are 4-20% polyacrylamide gels run in TBE for 50 minutes.
