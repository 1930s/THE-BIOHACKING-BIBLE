It seems that using more than the minimal 2ul can be important for obtaining reliable measurements.  3ul works consistently.
*OD600 = 0.1 is equivalent to approximately 5 x 10(8) cells/ml
Determined at one dilution with MC1061 by counting cells with hemacytometer: OD600 of 0.1 = 4 x 10(8) cells/ml (12/11/06, Per M.)<br>
Determined at one dilution with XL1-BLue by plating cells: OD600 of 0.1 = 5.9 x 10(8) cells/ml (12/19/06, Per M.)<br>
*OD600 measurement linear between values of 0.005 and 0.35
