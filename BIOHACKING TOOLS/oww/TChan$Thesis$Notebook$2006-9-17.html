==Proposal==
* Revised according to William's suggestions
* Sent to Barbara Lewis, along with note about study card and necessary extension

==Schematics==
* Drew up beginning schematics for box - just one sheet ostensibly.

===Design Notes===
* Must keep thrombin aptamer sites solidly within the confines of the box - can't extend out on the sides, thus, will try to keep them in a stripe in the middle fo the ravioli.
