#'''[[User:Jkm|Jkm]] 10:11, 12 Jul 2005 (EDT)''': Not sure if this is feasible, but automated sequence matching would be helpful. Similar to blast, but let me upload a set of sequence files (tagged as forward or reverse) and a BB part, and the Registry should align the sequences to verify the part. It would also be nice to save those sequence files, linked to the BB part, for future reference. 
#*'''Ilya''': A primitive version of such tool lives on my machine: http://habanero.mit.edu/cgi-bin/biobricks.pl
#Download the sequence with annotated features of a part or assembly in genbank format. 
#'''[[User:Rshetty|Reshma]] 05:22, 14 Jul 2005 (EDT)''': Blast against the entire database (ideally such that BioBrick ends could automatically be ignored).  
#'''[[User:Endy|Endy]] 11:35, 29 Jul 2005 (EDT)''': It would be great if there was a '''clear''' interface, or links to the already existing interface, for ordering (i) parts and (ii) parts assembly. 
#'''[[User:Jkm|Jkm]] 14:38, 29 Jul 2005 (EDT)''': It would be nice to have a single page that allowed editing of all the parts of a BB. For making single small changes, the current page is great. To make multiple changes (particularly when creating new parts), having to open and save each part individually is irritating. 
#'''[[User:Jkm|Jkm]] 16:44, 8 Aug 2005 (EDT)''': Propagate changes in basic parts through their derived parts. See, for instance, I13457 (bases 76-85 reading ...ttactatctc...) and I13528 (bases 76-86 reading ...ttacta'''c'''tctc...). I13457 was created first, then modified with the sequence came back with a (minor) change. I13528 remains unchanged, though it explicitly derives from I13457.
#'''[[User:Bcanton|BC]] 11:34, 26 Sep 2005 (EDT)''': There seems to be some difficulties currently in renaming a part in the registry.  In addition while editing the different sections of a part page independently has some advantages, there is also benefit in being able to rapidly create parts that are very similar or analagous by just copying and pasting all the data about one part.  Currently, this has to be done in several steps.
#*'''[[User:Bcanton|BC]] 15:06, 26 Sep 2005 (EDT)''': A related feature that might be desirable in the long term would be to allow the parallel creation of a family of composite parts that only vary in one of the parts.  For example, a family of reporters each with a slightly different promoter.  I'd like to be able to say, create ten parts simultaneously with each of the promoters R008X preceding E0240.  X=1:10.
#'''[[User:Rshetty|Reshma]] 19:39, 3 Oct 2005 (EDT)''': More powerful searching of the registry.  For instance, I want all parts of the form promoter.Q04400 where promoter can be any promoter.  It would also be nice to specify whether you want any parts, just available parts or available and working parts. Perhaps this could be implemented via regular expression matching?
#'''[[User:Bcanton|BC]] 15:35, 8 Nov 2005 (EST)''': ''Primer design tools'' - It would be nice if I could enter a part number and specify two enzymes and the registry would generate sets of primers ready to PCR that part from an arbitrary piece of DNA with BioBrick ends that could be cut with the specified enzymes.
#'''[[User:Rshetty|Reshma]] 13:58, 16 Nov 2005 (EST)''': Enter features on the opposite strand.
#*'''[[User:Rshetty|RS]] 16:14, 22 February 2006 (EST)''': This can now be done by putting a '''1''' in the '''Reverse''' column when editing the features of a particular part.
#'''[[User:Rshetty|Reshma]] 13:58, 16 Nov 2005 (EST)]''': Enter features by simply pasting the sequence of the feature into a box.  Then the registry would find that feature in the part sequence (on either strand) and auto-calculate the coordinates for you.  You then enter the name of the feature separately.  Ideally, it would be sophisticated enough to be able to cope with multiple instances of a feature sequence.
#'''[[User:Rshetty|Reshma]] 13:58, 16 Nov 2005 (EST)''': Blast results should include links from matches back to their registry page.
#'''[[User:Bcanton|BC]] 16:24, 22 February 2006 (EST)''': A forum to ask a question such as "Does anybody have sequencing primers for BBa_R00xx?" - a registry mailing list of all users might be the best way to do this?
#'''[[User:Rshetty|RS]] 13:03, 11 March 2006 (EST)''': Creation of a duplicate part in the reverse orientation.  This would save a person from having to reenter all the features.
#'''[[User:Endy|DE]] 15:28, 4 April 2006 (EDT)''': A recent changes feature (a la' most wikis) so that Registry users can see what's changing in near real time / real time.
#'''[[User:Rshetty|RS]] 17:52, 30 April 2006 (EDT)''': Creation of a duplicate part with a new part number.  This would save the user from having to reenter features when they create a new variant of an existing part.
