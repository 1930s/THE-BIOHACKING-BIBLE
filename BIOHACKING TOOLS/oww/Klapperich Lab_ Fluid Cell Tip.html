==Overview==

*The following manual describes the special steps needed when using a fluid cell tip for submerged testing

==Materials==
*50 um Fluid Cell Tip
*Tweezers
*Superglue (if sample is not attached to AFM disk)
*Millipore Water (if using Fluid Cell Tip)
*PS-6 sheet from Vishay MicroMeasurements 

==Procedure==
===Start Up===
#Reserve the TriboIndenter at Yahoo Calendars
#*User Name:  nanoindenter
#*Password:  hysitron
#Turn on the computer if not already on

===Changing the Tip===
::[[Image:diagram.jpg|Fig1. Diagram of TriboIndenter]]
#With the computer on and the TriboScan software closed, turn off the piezo and transducer controllers.
#Unplug the left cable from the transducer holder and the granite horizontal beam.
#Loosen the transducer holder by unscrewing the horizontal silver knob to the right of microscope.
#Slide the transducer holdlder upwards and out of the hood.
#Unscrew the tip using the tip tool and place in the hollow tube.  
#Screw the tip in you desire stopping at the first sign of resistance.
#Slide the transducer holder back into place, connect the cables and retighten the screw.
#Turn both the peizo and transducer controllers back on.
#Rezero the tare value.
#Start TriboScan software.
#In the positioning window, go to Setup>>Tip Area Function. Select the correct tip area function.  

===Z-Axis Calibration in Air (Perform 1st and record in logbook)===
#Change the microscope feedback gain to 100 on the TriboScope panel and in the software. From the Positioning window select Setup>>Piezo Controls and change the value for Front-panel Microscope Feedback Gain to 100.  Minimize this window as a reminder to change the value back.
#From the positioning window, go to Setup>>Indent Open Loop Load Function.
#Set up the Load Function Editor to perform a 600uN 2-segment indent in air (AIR INDENT.ldf), for a total of 20 seconds.  For soft materials, this load should be increased so that the air indent goes approximately 5um, but 600uN should be sufficient.  
#From the Open Loop Load Function window, select Setup>>Advanced z-axis Calibration.
#Click "Calibrate Transducer."  The instructions at this point from the pop-up windows are fairly self-explanatory.
#The calibration window will pop up.  Check that the values in the table below are correct.
#Click done and follow the instructions.
#A graph will appear with a fitted functions of the Electrostatic Force constant as a function of displacement.  Verify that that the fit is reasonable and close this graph.
#Make sure to write the ESF and ZVG values in the log book.
#Return the microsoft feedback gain to 1000 on the TriboScope and in the software by opening the window that was minimized earlier.

===Tip Optics Calibration===
#From the positioning window, open the video window by clicking on the video button.
#Using the arrows in the Positioning window, move the optics to the PS-6 sample and find a "clean" spot to indent.
#You will probably need to disable the X-Y Safety Height.  From the positioning window or the TriboScan Toolbar, select safety limits>>X-Y Safety Disable button.
#Change the video settings to white=30 and black=15 to increase contrast.
#Move up with the Z motor so that Z>15mm and tip will clear.  Click on the create boundary button on the video window to create a sample boundary.
#From the positioning window, select Setup>>Indent Open Loop Load Function
#Open the load function, AIR INDENT.ldf.
#Zero the tare value.
#From the Positioning window, select Setup>>Calibrate Optics>>Stage Offset>>New Single Indent.
#The software will prompt you to adjust the tip height to about 1mm from the samples surface using the green arrows.  Click OK after you have done this. 
#After the indent move down in Z to be in focus on the sample.  Do not move in X or Y.  

===Z-Axis Calibration in Water (Perform before indenting on sample)===
#Change the microscope feedback gain to 100 on the TriboScope panel and in the software. From the Positioning window select Setup>>Piezo Controls and change the value for Front-panel Microscope Feedback Gain to 100.  Minimize this window as a reminder to change the value back.
#From the positioning window, go to Setup>>Indent Open Loop Load Function.
#Set up the Load Function Editor to perform a 600uN 2-segment indent in air (AIR INDENT.ldf), for a total of 20 seconds.  For soft materials, this load should be increased so that the air indent goes approximately 5um, but 600uN should be sufficient.  
#Move indenter tip into the water more than 5 microns above the sample.  
#From the Open Loop Load Function window, select Setup>>Advanced z-axis Calibration.
#Click "Calibrate Transducer."  The instructions at this point from the pop-up windows are fairly self-explanatory.
#The calibration window will pop up.  Check that the values in the table below are correct.
#Click done and follow the instructions.
#A graph will appear with a fitted functions of the Electrostatic Force constant as a function of displacement.  Verify that that the fit is reasonable and close this graph.
#Make sure to write the ESF and ZVG values in the log book.
#Return the microsoft feedback gain to 1000 on the TriboScope and in the software by opening the window that was minimized earlier.

===Performing A Displacement Control Air Indent===
#From the positioning window, go to Setup>>Indent Displacement Control Load Function.
#Open load function, "4000nm_AirIndent".
#Move tip to be in contact with the sample by watching the tare value

==Notes==
It is sufficient to calibrate tip area function once a every few months and/or with a new tip
