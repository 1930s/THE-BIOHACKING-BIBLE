== '''Model Simplification''' ==
<br><br> 
*<font size="4">'''Why we can simplify the 3d Model into a 2D Model'''</font size="4">
:*Simplification is possible because of the similarity of the growth rates of the predator terms (V and W) in the 3D Model
::*Their complex production terms are identical
::*Only their dissipative terms (-d1*V and -d2*W ) varies
:*A simple hypotheses could lead to a very big simplification in our analysis
:*A 2D analysis is much simpler, and still will give us valid prediction on whether the system will oscillate.
<br><br>

*<font size="4">'''Required Hypotheses for Simplification'''</font size="4">
:* Hypothesis 1: to ensure V and W have same growth rates
::* '''Hypothesis 1: d1=d2''')
:* Hypothesis 2:To have equality of the initial conditions
::* '''Hypothesis 2: [aiiA] = [LuxR]''' at time t=0
:* Under previous 2 Hypotheses
::* aiiA and LuxR  start at the same concentration 
::* they have the same rate of production and degradation
::* hence they have at the same concentration throughout
:* System then can be simplified to

*<font size="4"> '''Validity of the hypotheses'''</font size="4">
:* Hypothesis 1 : d1=d2
::* The assumption of d1=d2 is feasible because aiiA and LuxR within the cells will be washed out at the same rate in chemostat. 
::* As long as we can ensure the washing out rate is much more dominant than their natural half-life (easily achieved) the assumption should hold
:* Hypothesis 2 is not really essential
::* it is fortunate as it was hard to ensure
::* if d1=d2, the difference between W and V will decay to 0 exponentially (with a time constant 1/d1)
::* therefore after a little time we can assume V=W
::* the larger d1, the faster the assumption becomes valid
::* the larger the difference between initial values of V & W, the longer the settling time of reaching V=W only
::* In particular we are sure that the condition on the parameters for obtaining a limit cycle will still be identical in 2D and 3D despite of the initial concentrations of U V W.
<br><br>

*<font size="4">'''Problem : in Theory , there is a Huge Difference Between 2D and 3D'''</font size="4>
:* Poincare-Bendixson Theorem works for 1D and 2D only, but not 3D 
::* We only need simple requirements for a limit cycle in 2D
::* In 3D the requirement is more complex - or much more complex
:* So are our results in 2D worth anything ? 
::*If our hypotheses are exactly met: Yes!
::*In practice hypotheses not exactly met, but we have a margin of error
::*A slight error on Hypothesis 2 is not important 
::*Slight error on hypothesis 1 (d1 not strictly equal to d2): 2 Scenarii
:::* Scenario 1: (the kind one)
::::* For d1=d2 and a range of parameters well chosen we have oscillations
::::* Because the system is well behaved , we still have oscillations at the vicinity of these parameters (hence for d1 slightly different from d2)
:::* Scenario 2: (the not so nice one)
::::*[aiiA] and [LuxR] get more and more out of synchronisation
::::*However, if the hypotheses are almost met, we can hope to have a few synchronised cycles
<br><br>

*<font size="4">'''Conclusion'''</font size="4">
:*There is a lot to learn from the 2D model
:*A word of caution: 
:::[[Image:2d model 0b.PNG|thumb|400px|left|Simulation of Full 3D model done by Cell Designer|center]] 
<br style="clear:both;"/>
::*The simulation above shows individual cycles of [aiiA] and [LuxR]
::** Frequencies are equal
::** Profiles very similar
::** Peak amplitudes different
::**Clearly for such cycles d1=d2 was not met and yet we have oscillations. We therefore have to study the 3D case in its entirety at some point
::*However for our current interest of whether the system can result in generation, 2D case of d1=d2 should be enough
