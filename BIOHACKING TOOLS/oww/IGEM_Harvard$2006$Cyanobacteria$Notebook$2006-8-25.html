== Miniprep of Nick's cultures #5 and #8 ==
I miniprepped the 4 cultures Nick inoculated last night, and labeled them 5-1, 5-2, 8-1, and 8-2. 

From Nick's email:

<code>
All three colonies are KaiB constructs.  I have made 4 overnight 
cultures with the following labels:

"NES 5" is a putative KaiB insert in a J04500 from a 6:1 Insert:Backbone 
reaction using the NEB ligase.
"NES 5" is a second culture started from the same colony.
"NES 8" is a putative KaiB insert in a J04500 from a 3:1 Insert:Backbone 
reaction using the Roche ligase.
"NES 8" is from a different (*not* clonal) colony from the same ligation 
reaction as the other NES 8.

== Restreak and colony PCR ==
I restreaked, colony PCR'd, and inoculated 10 colonies from Nick's ligation #5 that he plated on 2006-8-24 ([[IGEM:Harvard/2006/Nicholas_Stroustrup%27s_Notebook#Ligation_Assay|bottom of link]]). They are restreaked on two plates.

===Ligation conditions:===
KaiC Gel + Gel Backbone #5 II at 17C

=== Colony PCR reaction ===
* 8 uL PCR supermix
* 1 uL VF2 primer
* 1 uL VR primer

=== Colony PCR master mix ===
* 88 uL PCR supermix
* 11 uL VF2 primer
* 11 uL VR primer

Pipette 10 uL into each reaction.

=== Colony PCR schedule ===
* 95C for 15'00
* Do 30 times:
** 95C for 0'30
** 55C for 0'30
** 72C for 2'00
* 72C for 10'00
* 4C forever

== E-gel image of colony PCRs ==
It looks like the colonies don't contain our plasmid. (How can you tell? - See Below)

If there were no insert, we'd expect a 200bp band from a PCR.  If there was no plasmid at all, our colonies would not have grown up under AMP selection.  Ambiguously, no bands at all were seen.


== E-gel image of \X and \X-P digests of Nick's KaiB + J04500 ligations ==
I forgot to run the undigested plasmid on this gel, but by comparing the \X and \X-P digests, it appears we still don't have insert. (How can you tell? - See Below) We expect ~530bp insert from this ligation.

I'm having trouble interpreting this gel.  The X-P cut should produce either a 530bp KaiB insert, a 200bp lac-rbs insert, or no insert at all.  None of these options appear; we appear to get multiple 3+kb bands.  Also, singly cut plasmid produces two bands, whereas doubly-cut plasmid produces only one band.  It seems unclear how the presence or absence of any insert can be determined from this gel.
