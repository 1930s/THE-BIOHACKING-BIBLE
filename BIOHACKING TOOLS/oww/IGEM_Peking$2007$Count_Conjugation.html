=Conjugation Test=
*choose the Donor cell and Recipient Cell which must be different Antibiotic.

==Day1:==
#Get the plates from -4 fridge：Donor, Recipient, Control.
#Amplification Culture in liquid LB for 12 hours.

==day 2:==
#put 2mL of culture into 20mL of LB with antibiotics, sub-culturing.

===Donor===
#Test OD600 after 30 minutes of sub-culturing, stop subculturing when OD600 reached 0.45~0.6(log phase).
#After sub-culturing decant the 500uL culture into a 1.5mL tube.
#spin down (top speed for 1 min), discard fluid.
#resuspend in 500mL LB(NO Antibiotic!), vortex.
#Repeat steps 3-4-3 in this order then progress to step 6.
#Re-suspend with 500mL LB.
#Place the cell suspension on ice.

===Recipient===
#decant the recipient cells(500uL culture into a 1.5mL tube) when reached the stationary phase.
#spin down (top speed for 1 min.), discard fluid.
#resuspend in 500mL LB(NO Antibiotic!), vortex.
#Repeat steps 3-4-3 in this order then progress to step 6.
#Re-suspend with 500mL LB.
#Place the cell suspension on ice.

===mixing===
*Donor cells(log phase, include control) mixed with recipient cells(stationary phase).
*Mix by vortexing.
*culture in 37℃ for 90 minutes, 220rpm.

===Plating===
*Setting up serial dilutions:original, 10-1, 10-2, 10-3, 10-4, 10-5
*Pipette 200µL of each serial dilution onto an Double antibiotic plate.
*Notes: Some controls may growth on double antibiotic plate when these cultures are not being diluted.

==result==
*The frequency of transfer was expressed as the ratio (percentage) of the number of transconjugants to that of the donors.
