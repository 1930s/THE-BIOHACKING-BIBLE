M9 Broth has been made up and is sitting in the fridge in T/L

==Electroporations==
*We electroporated the following in the morning 
**I13521, 18I
**7A->3O DNA 2
*DNA and competent cells with DNA are in cold room
*Plates in 37C incubator in T/L

==Maxiprep==
*Maxi-preped the following parts
**1I
**5M
**12D->24A colony 1, 3, 4
**16P
**2M
**7A->3O colony 2
*Maxiprep DNA in fridge in T/L



==Ligation==
*Redo ligation 12D->2H
**Cut 12D with P & X, yellow buffer
**Cut 2H with S & P, orange buffer
*30 uL digests
*extract DNA successful, however, there was a faint larger band in the 2H lane, but we took out the larger band which corresponded most closely to 3381 bp, the expected size
*Gene clean wash
*Set ligations at 14:30, to be ready at 16:30
*Gene clean ligation product
*Electroporation completed
*Incubated at 37C in Dr. Mann's Lab

==Electrocompetent cells==
*Cells have been made competent...see protocol
