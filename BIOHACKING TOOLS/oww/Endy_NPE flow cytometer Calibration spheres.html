== Why we use calibration spheres==
We currently have spheres which can be used to:
#make sure the fluorescent channel(s) are behaving properly
#get a standard to correct day-to-day fluctuations in the readings of the fluorescent channels 
#calibrate the electronic volume channel (EV) i.e. establish a correspondence between channel number and volume

== Spheres we have in the lab ==
The calibration we currently have (August 2005) were purchased from [http://www.spherotech.com Spherotech]. Other labs use spheres from [http://www.polysciences.com Polysciences] or [http://www.bangslabs.com Bangs Labs]. Michael Brochu Sr said he uses 1um spheres with cat.#FS03F from Bangs Labs which give 7-8% CV (on the fluorenscence or the EV channel?].

== How to dilute the spheres ==
The spheres should be diluted so that the rate is < 500 counts/sec. Higher rates increase the chance of doubles. Note that I checked a couple of blanks (medium without any cells) and they gave counts (noise) at a rate of ~1-2 counts per second. This mean that the lower the count rate of your spheres, the higher the % noise. I try to get the rate between 200 and 500.

Here are dilutions of our current batch of spheres (2005-08-23) which give adequate rates:
* 0.87um spheres (Spherotech):  10^-4 dilution in Isodiluent (NPE systems) gives a rate of ~200counts/sec
* 1.79um non-fluorescent polysterene beads (Spherotech): 0.5*10^-4 dilution in Isodiluent (NPE systems) gives a rate of ~ 250 counts/sec.
