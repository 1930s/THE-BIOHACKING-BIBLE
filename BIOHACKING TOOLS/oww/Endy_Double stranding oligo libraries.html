==Order oligos and double-stranding [[Designing_primers|primers]]==
* Dilute stocks to 100uM
* Dilute working stocks of libraries and double-stranding primers to 10uM
* Dilute working stocks of sequencing primers to 3.2uM (6.4uL of stock solution in 193.6uL water)

* Some considerations:
** Oligos should be the maximum length because this will help with PCR cleanup and ligation efficiency
** Make sure you have some spacer sequence around the restriction site.  [http://www.neb.com/ NEB] has a list of the length of the spacer sequence required for each restriction enzyme. ([[Restriction digest#Notes|8bp is usually a safe bet]])
** Order the lowest concentration allowable for the size oligo you want – this will be 50nmole for the 100bp oligo.  This will already be more than you’ll need.
** If you don’t mind spending more money you can order special “doped” oligo pools where instead of even concentrations of A/T or A/T/C/G or A/T/C, you get 90%A/2%C/8%G, etc.  This allows for you to generate a library which is much more likely to produce productive clones.

==Double strand the library with modified PCR==
*Expected max library size is 10<sup>8</sup> molecules (limit set by transformation efficiency.)  You want to load 10X the expected library size for a single library construction.  Therefore, you would like to have 10<sup>9</sup> molecules for a single transformation.
**1pmol corresponds to ~10<sup>11</sup> molecules
**Use 25pmol of library to make enough for 2500 transformations
*Total library DNA should be less than ~25pmol per 100uL reaction

===Reaction Mix (100uL, 25pmol library)===
Use the following reaction mix for each PCR reaction:
*10 &mu;l 10x Thermo polymerase buffer
*10 &mu;l 10x dNTPs (10x = 2.5 mM each dNTP)
*5 &mu;l 10 &mu;M FWD primer
*5 &mu;l 10 &mu;M REV primer
*1 &mu;l Polymerase (taq or vent)
*66.5 &mu;l H<sub>2</sub>O
*2.5 &mu;l 10&mu;M library stock

===PCR protocol===
*95<sup>o</sup>C for 2.5 minutes
*Cycle 5 times:
**55<sup>o</sup>C (or whatever temperature is appropriate) for 30 seconds (annealing) 
**72<sup>o</sup>C for 1.5 minutes (elongation)
*72<sup>o</sup>C for 10 minutes (final elongation)
*4<sup>o</sup>C forever

==Perform PCR cleanup on the double-stranded library==
* This concentrates the samples and allows for the buffer to be switched to something more appropriate.
* PCR purification columns can handle up to 10ug of DNA
** 100pmol of a 100bp oligo is about 3ug, so multiple 100-ul reactions of 25pmol can be combined into one column
* Expected recovery from a PCR purification reaction is 90% (from the Invitrogen package)
* You can run a sample of the PCR product out on a gel against a sample of the original library to verify that the double stranding worked (double stranded DNA should run slightly faster than single stranded) [[Image:Double-stranded_oligo_libraries.jpg|thumb|none|300px|Three libraries ~100bp; on the left is the single-stranded oligo; on the right are double-stranded oligos (different lanes are different primers)]]

==[[Restriction digest]] the library==

==Perform PCR cleanup on the digest==
* This will remove the cut ends, since they are small.

==[[DNA_Ligation|Ligate]] the sample from the PCR cleanup with a vector==  

==Transform into compotent cells==
* This will either be done via [[Electroporation|electroporation]] or [[Transforming_chemically_competent_cells|chemically compotent cells]], we’re experimenting now to see which one is more efficient.
