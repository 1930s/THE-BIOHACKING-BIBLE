====Lab and Funding====
Prof. YJ Yuan kindly provides experiment environment and most of the financial support. 

Also our team gets the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Tianjin University.

====Primary proposals:====
====Synthetic Biology related technology====
*Logic gate(AND,OR,NOT,NAND,NOR,XOR):We combine some of them to construct several devices, such as DOUBLE CONTROL SWITCH, NUMERUS COMPARATOR, INCONSISTENT CIRCUIT, SR 

FLIP FLOP, ENCODER, CLOCK, much of them come from the electrocircuit consideration.
*Simulate reversible reaction: We try to simulate the reversible reaction with considering the impact of catalyzer, temperature, concentration and pressure. To use 

two fluorescence reporters, we can monitor the reaction direction by the colour varying.
*System controlling lytic/ lysogenic states: By cell-to-cell communication, we try to construct a system that a signal from a cell can control the lytic/ lysogenic 

states of cell infected by phage and using different reporter according to the different state.
*As we all know, time delay is very common in biology system. Is there some method that we can take use of this time delay? So we can use it to all the situations 

change is needed.
Because biological system is unpredictable and couldn’t control strictly as electrocircuit, there are still many problems we must face. We proceed with all the ideas 

but focus on the most feasible.
====Other inspiration====
Besides the logic application in our biological machine, we also hope to find other inspiration in energy and medicine issues. Surely, we get closer and closer to the 

final project.
====We are looking forward to your attention to our team====
