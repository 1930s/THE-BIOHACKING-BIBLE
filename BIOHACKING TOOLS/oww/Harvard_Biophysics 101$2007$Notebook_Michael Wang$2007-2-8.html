I thought it might be worth it to try implementing functions...
I approached this problem by doing the counts each time a trial is completed.  I'm not sure if it would have been faster to do all the trials and then store them before counting.  Alternately, I guess you could keep track of consective trials as they happen.  Maybe one of the CS concentrators might have an answer.

Code:

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env python

import random
import string

#CountRepeats counts the number of sequences in a single trial passed as a string
#and then counts the consecutive string occurances and adds them to the appropriate
#count matrix
def countRepeats(trial, search_char, matrix):    
    for i in range (10):
        substr = ''.join([search_char for n in range (i+1)]) #create the substring to search for of appropriate length
        count = 0
        pos = trial.find(substr,0)
        while not pos == -1:
            count = count + 1
            pos = trial.find(substr, pos +1)
        matrix[i][count]+=1  #add one to the appropriate element in the 2d matrix

        
#DisplayCounts displays the data stored in the matrix and calculates total occurances
def displayCounts (character, matrix):
    print
    print
    Title = "Number of trials with n occurances of the given consecutive string of "+character
    print Title.rjust(80)
    print "n".rjust(45)
    print "String".rjust(len(matrix)),
    for m in range(len(matrix[0])):
        print repr(m).rjust(6),
    print "Total*".rjust(8)
    totals = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
    for i in range(len(matrix)):
        substr = ''.join([character for n in range (i+1)])
        print substr.rjust(len(matrix)),
        for j in range(len(matrix[i])):
            print repr(matrix [i][j]).rjust (6),
        total = 0
        for k in range(len(matrix [i])):
            total+=matrix[i][k]*k
        print repr(total).rjust(7)
        totals[i]=total
    print "*Total refers to total occurances of a particular string"
    return totals
    
#Initialize a list of 10 zeros
zero_list = range(10)
for i in range(10):
    zero_list[i]=0;
print zero_list;
#there must be a better way to do this....
#ARGH!  I originally intended to use zero_string below, but apparently it passes a pointer instead of a value...

#Initialize 2d matrix to store data
count_of_H_counts = []
count_of_T_counts = []
for j in range (10):
    count_of_H_counts.append ([0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]) #wanted to use zero_string here
    count_of_T_counts.append ([0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]) #and here

#Run Trials
for k in range (10000):  #This for loop controls the number of trials performed
                         #where each trial is ten tosses
    random.seed()

    #populating the trial    
    temp = ""
    for l in range (10):
        if random.random()<0.5:
            temp = temp + "H"
        else:
            temp = temp + "T"

    #call the countRepeats function to process the new temp trial and add to H/T matrix    
    countRepeats(temp, 'H',count_of_H_counts)
    countRepeats(temp, 'T',count_of_T_counts)

#Call displaycounts to display the tables and calculate totals
Htotals=displayCounts ('H',count_of_H_counts)
Ttotals=displayCounts ('T',count_of_T_counts)

#Display the totals
print
print
print "Total Counts"
for i in range(len(Htotals)):
    print repr(i+1).rjust(5),"|",Htotals[i]+Ttotals[i]
</pre>

Output:
