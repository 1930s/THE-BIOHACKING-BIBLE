==Assignment Due Mar 15==
'''Task 1'''
*Based on our discussions and assignments thus far, interpret this sequence (manually).
*Include a specific and detailed outline of what you did and why.  Think about how each step could be implemented in python.
*Summarize your findings in "layman's terms", e.g. what would you, as a physician, tell your patient with this sequence?

'''Task 2'''
*Design your own query sequence which could be used in an exercise similar to '''Task 1'''.
*Post your query sequence to your notebook page before class on March 15, but keep your solution private for now.
*Make sure to use fasta format


==Assignment Due Mar 20==
*Write a script to automatically carry out the interpretation you performed manually.
