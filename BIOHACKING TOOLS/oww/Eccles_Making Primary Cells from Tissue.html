=Making Primary Cells from Mouse Tissue=

===Materials===
Sterile Gem blades (wrap gem blades in tinfoil and autoclave)<br>

Eppendorf tubes containing 1mL 1x PBS on ice - sterile (or larger tubes and PBS volume if you are making cells from large tissue samples - 15ml tubes)<br>

====Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium (100x)====
Insulin-transferrin-selenium, 10mL, Invitrogen #41400-045<br>
Store at 4 degrees C<br>
Ready to use<br>


====Dexamethasone (20ug/mL)====
Dexamethasone, 1mg, Sigma #D8893<br>
Lyophilised reagent stored at 4 degrees C<br>

* Dissolve 1mg dexamethasone in 1mL of absolute ethanol to give a 1mg/mL solution
* Dilute 1 in 50 by adding 49mL media (DMEM/F-12 1:1 without additives) to give a final stock concentration of 20ug/mL
* Aliquot and store at -20
* Use between 20-200ng/mL final (50-500uL in 50mL media)

====Triiodotyronine (20ug/mL)====
Triiodotyronine, 1mg, Sigma #T5516<br>

* Dilute 1mg in 1mL sterile 1M NaOH. 
* Dilute 1 in 50 by adding 49mL media (DMEM/F-12 1:1 without additives) to give a final stock concentration of 20ug/mL
* Aliquot and store at -20
* Use between 0.6-6ng/mL final (1.5-15ul in 50mL media

====Murine Epidermal Growth Factor====
mEGF, 0.1mg, Sigma #E4127

* Add 1mL media containing 10% FCS (0.9mL DMEM/F-12 1:1 without additives + 0.1ml FCS)
* Aliquot into 6uL lots to avoid freeze/thawing
* Store at -20 
* 0.1mg/mL stock solution is stable for up to 2 weeks at 4 degrees C once made up
* Use between 2-20ng/mL final (1-10ul in 50mL media)


===Interferon-gamma, mouse recombinant===
0.1mg, Sigma #I4777

After contacting Sigma technical help I identified that this batch of interferon-gamma contained not less than 1x10<sup>6</sup> units<br>
It seems that with any new batch of IFN-gamma ordered in one would need to check this (details didn't come with IFN-gamma)<br>

* Make 1mg/mL solution in 1x PBS (0.1mg in 0.1mL of 1x PBS).  This gives a 1x10<sup>7</sup>U/mL solution.
* Further dilute in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) no additives containing 10% FCS to 1x10<sup>5</sup>U/mL.
* Aliquoted into 100uL lots and stored at -20.
* Each time a 1x10<sup>5</sup>U/mL. aliquot is thawed it will need to be further diluted 1/10 to 1x10<sup>4</sup>U/mL in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) no additives containing 10% FCS.
* Aliquot 1x10<sup>4</sup>U/mL interferon-gamma  and store at -20 to prevent repeated freeze/thawing.
* Once thawed the interferon-gamma solution is stable for 1 week at 4 degrees C


===Collagenase Type II Solution===
Work out volume of collagenase type II solution required (depends on how many tissue samples and sizes you'll be harvesting)<br>
Here's some examples below of tissue that primary cells have been successfully made from.<br>
Any excess collagenase solution can be aliquoted and stored at -20 (avoid freeze/thawing more than 2x)<br>

* Aim to use a final concentration of 40mg collagenase type II/g of tissue<br>
* Weigh desired amount of collagenase type II into 15ml tube and store on ice<br>
* In cell culture hood aliquot volume of cell culture media (no additives) required and incubate on ice<br>
* Add suitable volume of media to collagenase to give 1mg/mL or 2mg/mL solution and pipette up and down to resuspend<br>
* Filter sterilise collagenase type II solution in cell culture hood<br>
* Leave on ice until ready to use<br>


===Euthanising Animal===
* Pour a little bit of water into bottom of chamber
* Add a few pellets of dry ice
* Place lid on chamber and swirl to get good gas emission
* Place mouse on centre platform and place lid on chamber
* Wait for 1min
* Check animal is dead
* Remove animal from chamber and tape onto dissection tray in a position suitable for collecting the desired tissue
* Squirt dissection area of mouse with 70% EtOH
* Begin dissection
* Remove desired tissue with sterile tools and place in tubes on ice containing 1x PBS
* Incubate on ice until ready to proceed


===Recovering Cells from Tissue===
* Take tissue on ice to cell culture hood
* Remove tissue from tube into sterile petri dish.  Pipette on a small volume of 1x PBS to prevent tissue sticking to plate
* Use sterile Gem blade to chop tissue up using up and down chopping motions combined with a bit of smearing against dish surface.  It is not necessary to completely mince up tissue
* Pipette the tissue soup into a fresh eppendorf
* Use ice cold media and pipette onto dish to wash up the last bits of tissue from plate - pipette into eppendorf (there will be a bit of tissue left behind which is fine)
* For embryonic mouse kidneys I've used 100uL of ice cold media without additives.  I've then added 0.2mg of collagenase type II (100uL of 2mg/mL or 200uL of 1mg/mL).  A final volume of 200uL or more worked well.
* Digest tissue at 37 degrees C for 30mins with shaking (850rpm on eppendorf shaker)
* Pellet tissue/cell debris at 800g, 5min
* Discard supernatant and resuspend tissue/cell debris in 1mL of media (with additives)
* Pellet tissue/cell debris at 800g, 5min
* Discard supernatant and bring tissue/cell debris up in warm cell culture media (with additives).  I used 0.5mL for embryonic mouse kidneys
* Pipette tissue/cell debris in warmed media into collagen coated cell culture vessel of suitable size containing media and disperse as normally would.  For the mouse embryonic kidneys I pipetted each half of the cell debris in media (250uL) onto one well of a 6 well plate (ended up with 2 wells of a 6 well plate for each kidney).  We found this to be of suitable size and also allowed cloning of individual cells using cloning rings.
* Incubate at 37 degrees C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>
* Check cells each day
* Change media every 2nd day


===For SV40 large T Positive Cells===
* Once cells are established they can be moved to the permissive temperature of 33 degrees C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>
* Add interferon-gamma to a final concentration of 10units/mL in cell culture media.
