==Mode of Action==
Spectinomycin is a bacteriostatic agent that inhibits translocation of the peptidyl tRNA from the A site to the P site.

==Working Concentrations and Stock Solutions==
Up to 100mg/mL stock concentration. 100ug/mL final concentration.

==Resistance Gene==
Mutations in rpsE, the S5 protein, prevent spectinomycin from binding.

==Inhibiting protein synthesis==
In addition to being used for selection, spectinomycin can also be used to inhibit protein synthesis, for example, to inhibit wild-type ribosome activity in the presence of orthogonal ribosomes. 150-500&mu;g/ml spectinomycin is commonly used for this purpose.  Papers using spectinomycin in this way include -
