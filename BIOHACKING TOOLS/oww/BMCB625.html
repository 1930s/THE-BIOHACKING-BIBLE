==Course overview==
*Location: BRB 603. Wednesdays from 9:30 - 11:30 (practice and review session) and Thursdays (The Real Thang) from 10:30 - 12:30
*[[BMCB625:How the class works|How the Class Works]]
'''Advanced Molecular Biology: Topics and Methods in Modern Molecular Biology.''' An advanced graduate course with an emphasis on the latest research from the primary literature along with in-depth presentation of the basic concepts of biochemistry and molecular biology. Topics will be chosen from areas of expertise in the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology faculty. Topics will include properties of nucleotides and nucleic acids, the composition and structure of eukaryotic chromatin, eukaryotic gene expression, DNA replication, RNA transcription, RNA splicing and metabolism, and protein translation.

This class is not a faculty-driven lecture class, but is based on student presentations of background material and research papers selected from the current literature.  It is designed to maximize active roles for students in each class.

==Goals of the Class==
#encourage students to seize every available resource for sifting and apprehending scientific matter (e.g., Nature podcasts, social bookmarking, RSS feeds, faculty, each other)
#develop an appreciation for the molecular machines that duplicate nucleic acids
#get familiar with collaborative web-based tools (OWW and wiki)
#create ambassadors for open science
#improve presentation skills, both in form and scientific content
#engage in active group-based learning
#gain leadership and organizational experience
#build a shared web resource for information obtained in the class
