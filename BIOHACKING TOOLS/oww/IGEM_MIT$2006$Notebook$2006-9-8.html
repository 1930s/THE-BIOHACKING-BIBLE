==Transformation of J45400==

*ligated J45399 (4 of them...1A, 1B, 1C, and 2A) to R0011, in A/T backbone, to make J45400 in A/T backbone.  We still need to check the sequencing of the J45399s to see which ones were right...hopefully one of the 4 I used was correct.  there wasn't a lot of R0011, so I chose 1A, 1B, and 1C b/c they looked the best on the gel, and 2A for the heck of it.

==Osmy+E0840 for plate reader==

*transformed osmy+E0840 FN for the plate reader...used an amp plate b/c I wasn't sure what the resistance was.
