=Cloning=
We have been able to successfully clone the following antibiotic pancakes
* Hin
*Hin with LVA degredation tag
*Cmr- forward
* Kan-forward
*Tet-forward
* Tet-backwards
* Cmr-backwards


<font color="red">'''KanB'''</font color>
*Kan backwards is the only gene that we are completely positive has not been cloned into a plasmid in the correct orientation. 
=RE and Hix=
We have been able to clone RE into cells. The RE that we are using has two point mutations but they should not compromise the activity of the Fis-binding sites please see the page for  part Part BBa_J3101 [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_J3101] for further details. 

* As per the [http://parts2.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/Davidson_Assembly_Plan| assembly plan] we will be attaching the RE downstream of the double terminator BBa_B0015 [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_B0015]

*We also have two cultures with the correct sequences for Hix C. 
*We have sent a "Master Plate" with cultures of all of the things that we have cloned to the Mammoths.
