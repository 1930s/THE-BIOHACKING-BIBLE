Today we need to do the following:

*Manpower map discussion/rearrangement

===Updates:===
*Ray:
*#cI: thresholding might = hard --> talk to TK
*#see signal processing page for details -- lac I regulated
*#TO DO: follow up on convo from meeting

*Annie: 
*#Fur issue was solved: fur not essential gene -- a fur transposon line, but not stable. Decide: keep tracking, or keep our own.
*#Fec A: should we just make our own? 
*#Internal fusion: we got the technique.

*Maxine:
**got an email from scFv people: 
**#scFv don't have to worry about "partial cds", 
**#binding happens at foo region, 
**#gonna get phage-mid.
**#lets synthesize anti-rabbit scFv

*Jenny:
