==Experimental==

===Stock Solution===
10mg/ml in H<sub>2</sub>0, store at -20&deg;C (from [http://molbiol.edu.ru/eng/protocol/01_05.html here])

Soluble in water at least to 200 mg/ml

Insoluble in 50% alcohol

===Working Concentration===
20&mu;g/ml <cite>Khlebnikov-JIndMicrobiolBiotechnol-2002</cite>

80&mu;g/ml for Mycoplasma selection

===Mode of Action===

Inhibits protein synthesis by binding to L6 protein of the 50S ribosomal subunit.

(from [[Molecular Cloning]])

===Resistance Gene===
The most common resistance gene is the aacA-aphD gene found in the transposon Tn4001.  It conveys resistance to both Gentamycin and Kanamycin in two separate domains.  Another common resistance gene is the aacC1 gene, (conveying resistance to Gentamycin only) is found in the plasmid pJN105.  <cite>Newman-Gene-1999, Wohlleben-MolGenGenet-1989</cite>

===Safety===
Gentamycin is an important antibiotic for human use.  Think about alternative antibiotics when choosing to incorporate gentamycin resistance into your constructs.  Particularly, think carefully about inserting gentamycin resistance into mobile plasmids or mobile transposons.
