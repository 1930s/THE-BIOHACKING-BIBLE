Welcome to the homepage of Dr. Nagasuma Chandra's group at [http://www.physics.iisc.ernet.in/~dichome/ Bioinformatics Centre], [http://www.iisc.ernet.in/ Indian Institute of Science].

The current focus of our research is the application of systems biology to understanding diseases and immunological processes with particular emphasis on carbohydrate recognition. An obvious outcome will be an application of the obtained knowledge in drug and vaccine discovery.
