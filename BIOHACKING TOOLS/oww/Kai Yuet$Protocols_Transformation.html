=Bacterial Transformation (KPY)=

====Following 10 μL Ligation With [http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/productM0202.asp NEB T4 DNA Ligase]====

==Materials==

* Chemically Competent E. Coli Cells
* [[Kai Yuet/Protocols:DNA_Ligation | 10 μL Ligation Mixture]]

==Procedures==

# Retrieve chemically competent cells from -80°C freezer.
# Thaw cells for 5 minutes on ice.
# Add 2.5 μL of 10 μL ligation mixture into the microcentrifuge tubes containing the cells, stir gently, and then agitate the tubes.
# Ice the cells for 30 minutes.
# Heat shock the cells for 5 minutes at 37°C in the water bath.
# Incubate the cells on ice for 2 minutes.
# Add 500 μL of LB (no antibiotic) to the cells.
# Place the cells back into water bath for another 30 minutes of incubation.
# Spread the mixture of LB and cells onto a plate with the appropriate antibiotic.
# Grow overnight at 37°C.

==Notes==

* Incubation time on ice can be reduced to 15 minutes in case of rush.
* Water bath incubation can also be reduced to 15 minutes in case of rush.
* Mid-October [[Kai Yuet/Protocols:DNA_Ligation | ligation]]/transformation failures were resolved with a change of loading dye following enzymatic digestion of DNA.
