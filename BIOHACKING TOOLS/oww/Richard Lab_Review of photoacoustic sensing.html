| basics
|| in a photoacoustic sensor a gas sample is imported to a chamber where it is trapped, and pulsed with a infra red light, at a wave legth range specific to the gas being measured. The wave length range is created by passing the IR light through a filter. The IR pulse causes the gases volume to change at every pulse, creating a pressure change pattern detected by a microphone placed in the sample chamber. The resulting sound wave varies with the concentration of the measured gas, which is interpolated through a calibration curve. In the Innova gas monitor (Innova, DK), the calibration curve is programmed into the sensor and the gas concentration is automatically output.

|| Replacing the microphone with a new type of pressure sensor inreased the sensitivity of a photoacoustic sensor; it detected methane at lower than 1 ppb. The article also includes a good introduction on photoacoustic sensing.
