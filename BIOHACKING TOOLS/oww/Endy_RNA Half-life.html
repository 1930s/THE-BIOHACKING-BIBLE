This is a protocol for measuring the half-life of mRNA in ''E. coli'', growing at steady state in a chemostat, by Rifampicin transcription arrest.

==Prepare RNase-diminished bench==
# Wipe down thoroughly with EtOH
# Use Rnase Zap wipes to clean bench and pipettes 
# Wipe all down with paper towel/ H2O, 2x.

==Culture growth conditions==
*Continuous culture in [[Endy:STN Chemostat Protocol|chemostat]].

==Transcription arrest and sample collection==
#End chemostat mode:
#*Pull feed needle from chamber
#*Open rubber lid
#Pull “pre-rif” samples:
#*Withdraw 2.6 mL culture
#*Dispense two replicates of1 mL aliquots into 0.8 mL of stop solution each on ice. Reserve samples on ice until all time points are collected.
#*With remaining 0.6 mL, measure OD600 of a 1:2 dilution of culture in media
#At time zero, add Rifampicin stock (50 mg/mL) to a final concentration of 100 μg/mL. (for 20 mL chemostat volume, add 40 μL stock.)
#For each time point, beginning with time = 2 min:
#*Withdraw 2.0 mL culture
#*Aliquot and reserve on ice as above
#Sample at 30 second intervals over 2 to 6 min window.

==Sample Processing==
*Continue with [[Endy:RNA extraction|RNA extraction]] protocol.
*RNA per sample can be measured by [[Endy:Northern Blot, 32P End-Labeled Probes|Northern Blot]], [[Endy:Real-time RT-PCR|real-time RT-PCR]] or other methods.

==Notes==
There’s considerable variation in the literature in reported working concentrations of Rifampicin used to arrest transcription. Rifampicin isn't soluble in water, so most stock solutions are typically in methanol or DMSO. A desirable working concentration of Rifampicin will be high enough to fully arrest transcription, but low enough to avoid toxicity issues with the solvent:
*Bernstein et al.: Working concentration = 500 μg/mL Rifampicin. (Stock in DMSO.)
*Carrier and Keasling: Working concentration = 250 μg/mL Rifampicin. (Stock in methanol.)
**In Smolke, Carrier, and Keasling: Working concentration = 2 mg/mL Rifampicin. (''highest [[Caitlin Conboy|I've]] seen reported'')
*[[Sean Moore]], personal communication: Rifampicin at 500 μg/mL to completely arrest transcription. Typically uses 100 – 250 μg/mL, sufficient for his purposes.
