Hello,

I am currently a senior at Morgan State University in Baltimore. I am spending a wonderful summer here at MIT working with Tom Knight on Glucose Sensing Bacteria. This is a very interesting topic which is different from what I'm used to as an electrical and computer engineer, but hey, lets have some fun here at MIT!!!
