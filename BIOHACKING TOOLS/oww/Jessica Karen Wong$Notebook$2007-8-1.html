==I2057==
*Transformation plates w/ DB3.1 had no colonies 
*Doing a positive control on DB3.1 w/ puc18
*Was going to digest the preps of I2057-EX and I2057-ES resealed w/ Not1, but didn't have enough DNA
*Making a 10ml overnight culture of each
*Minipreped overnight cultures of promoters J23116 and J23100
*Digested R0040, J23116, and J23100 - Eco/Spe

==I2056==
*PCR cleaned overnight digests of I2056-EX w/ E/X, I2056-EX w/ Not, I2056-SX S/X, I2056-SX w/ Not1
*Ligated I2056-EX-N and I2056-SX-N each to themselves (closed up)
*Transformed in Top10 and plated
*Digested RBS's B0030, B0031, and B0032 E/S and X/S each for later testing

==I2055==
[[Image:8-1.jpg|thumb|left|BB I2055 PCR]]
*Ran a gel of the overnight BB PCR's loaded: ladder sp I2055-EX sp I2055-SX
*Looked the right size
*PCR Cleaned overnight PCRs
*Digesting I2055-SX with S/X, I2055-SX w/ Not1, I2055-EX with E/X, I2055-EX w/ Not1 overnight

==F2620==
*Transformation plates had no colonies
*Religated F2620-3K3
*Transformed with Top10 and plated
*We're running out of DNA, so made new PCR
*Ran 1 100ul supermix PCR to add tails to F2620 in 1A3 at 53 w/ 1:30 ext time
