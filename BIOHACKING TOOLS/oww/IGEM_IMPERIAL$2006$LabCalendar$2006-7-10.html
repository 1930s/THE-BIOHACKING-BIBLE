===Culturing Bacteria===
*Combine together:
**10 mL growth medium
**200 uL DH5a ''E. coli'' gram negative bacteria
*Allow to grow for a few hours until the optical density of the bacterial solution is between 0.8 and 1.0 as measured by the spectrophotometer
*Cool the culture for a few minutes and place in an ice bath
*Centrifuge the bacteria to obtain a bacterial pellet
*Remove media and place on ice
*Add 1 mL of 100 mM calcium chloride solution
*Vortex and place back on ice bath
*Transfer 1 mL into a microcentrifuge tube and place back on ice
*Remove supernatant and resuspend in 100 uL of calcium chloride

===Innoculation===
*Innoculate a colony of bacteria into 2 mL of ampicillin resistant growth medium

===Transfering the part from the registry into the bacteria===
*We use part I13273 from well 4H (YFP Producer controleld by 3OC6HSL Receiver Device (LuxR based receiver controls production of YFP)
*Pipette 15 uL of ultrapure water into the well and dilute
*Remove and transfer into a microvial
*Remove 5 uL of DNA solution and place into solution containing the bacteria
*Leave solution for about 40 minutes
*Heat shock the soution at 42C for 90 sec and place back on ice bath
*Transfer the bacteria with the part onto an agar plate and spread out using a glass spreader
*Incubate at 37C overnight
