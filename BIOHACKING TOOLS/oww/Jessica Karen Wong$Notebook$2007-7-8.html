==Colony PCRs==
*[[Image:07.07.08-colony.jpg|thumb|left|Gel from 7/8/07]]
*Ran a gel of the overnight Colony PCR's
*L to R: Ladder; T9002-3K3 (4,3,2,1); I2055-1AK3 (1,2,3,4); E0240-3K3 (4,3,2,1); E0240-1AK3 (1,2); Ladder
*T9002 was to check if it is scarred, I2055 was to see if it is constructed (religation, not pcr-ing promoter), both E0240's scarred
*T9002 should be over 2kb but shows as only 400bp
*I2055 looks the right size (except for #2 which I probably messed up)
*E0240-1AK3 looks fine but 3K3 is also about 500bp
*Most likely 3K3 is the problem
*Made overnights of each type to prep for sequencing tomorrow
*Also overnighted 3K3 plasmid from original registry plate

==I2055 w/ PCRed in Promoter==
*Heat Shocked overnight double digest with Mfe1 and Nsi1
*Ligated with 1AK3
*Transformed 3ul of ligation and plated on Kan
*Started to ligate with 3K3 but since 3K3 is acting up, was discarded 

==I2056==
*Overnights in LB and Tet worked
*Strange, must have somehow lost Amp resistance
*Made a glycerol
*Minipreped w/ 8.5 water for sequencing and w/ EB
