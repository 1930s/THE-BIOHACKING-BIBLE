===sticky project:===

input:
*temperature (cold shock / heat shock promoters)
*light (either via light sensitive transcription/translation or photo-induced chemistry)
*cell growth (stationary phase, log phase)
*cell type (if growing different strains)
*metal ion (metal sensitive promoter)
*estrogen (ER binding domain)
*cre/lox recombination

parts:
*mussel peptide fused to circularly permuted OmpX (surface display protein, see Rice07)
**need tyrosine hydroxylase to convert tyrosine to L-DOPA (hydroxylation)?  can also occur non-enzymatically (reversible)
**need tyrosinase to convert L-DOPA to DOPA-quinone (oxidation)?  can also occur non-enzymatically (reversible) -- heavy metal ions (like copper) can catalyze...
*polystyrene peptide fused to OmpX 

output:
*stick to specific surface (plastic, polystyrene, etc)
*stick nonspecifically (noncovalently) to surface (mussel peptide in reduced DOPA form)
*crosslink and stick (covalently) to surface and each other (mussel peptide in oxidized quinone form)

output apps:
*microbial biofilms/membranes
*bacterial photo-lithography (light-induced glueing)
*population separations
*sensor readout

==Water Decontamination Application Example (Smart Filtration System)==

*Forrest:
**Water is collected from a river (or other source) into a filtration setup
**Bacteria is added to the water
**The bacteria bind to or take in metals or other pollutants (input 1: detection/uptake of pollutant)
**Input causes bacteria to be able to bind to the filter material (output 1: stickiness to filter material)
**The water is now pollutant-free (can be put back into the river or otherwise used, etc)
**The filter can be cleaned by rinsing/soaking it with water while shining light on it (input 2: light)
**This second input causes the bacteria to unbind from the filter material (output 2: loss of stickiness to filter material)

*Bernice:
**Bacteria lights up when on filter material (perhaps at a certain concentration)
**When filter glows to a certain extent, we know it's time to change the filter
**Forrest: could we just add dye to the bacteria to stain it a certain color?
