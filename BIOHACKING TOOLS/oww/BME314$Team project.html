===Interesting Facts===

*Antibodies are synthesized by a type of white blood cell known as B cells. Each b cell only displays one specific antibody.  
*In 1987, the world’s first genetically engineered mouse-human monoclonal antibody was used at UAB Hospital in the treatment of cancer. 
*Some mice have been genetically engineered to produce pure human antibodies, instead of mice antibodies.  
*Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognize and seek out one particular antigen. They are commonly used in diagnostics and therapeutic treatments. These antibodies are usually cloned to produce the amount needed.
*Outside of using engineered antibodies for human/ animal disease applications, they are also used towards plants. Research has been done on maize. 
*First monoclonal antibody approved to treat cancer was rituximab. It targets and destroys white blood cells involved with one type of non-hodgkin’s lymphoma. 
*Rituximab is a genetically engineered version of a mouse antibody that contains both human and mouse components. '''How strange it was based on a mouse antibody…'''

==Questions==
*What do you mean by creating a "sound argument" in the presentation? We are unsure of what we are arguing. 
*How specific do you want us to go into the presentation/report?
