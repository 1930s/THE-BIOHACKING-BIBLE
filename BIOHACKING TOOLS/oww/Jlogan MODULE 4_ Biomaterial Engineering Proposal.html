=='''Intro:'''== reference article from MIT news 

Found a study between MIT and Hong Kong University where researchers 
discovered a biodegradable liquid that can stop bleeding in seconds by 
binding to a certain peptide, and not affecting clotting or invoking 
the immune response. These peptides self-assemble with the gel to seal 
the wound and thus stop bleeding. The gel is biodegradable so it can be 
reused by the body to heal the wound area. Following these lines, we 
propose to find a similar material but instead target tumors and contain 
them in the same fashion so they are unable to grow or metastasize. Once 
the tumor is contained, this opens new methods for drug delivery or 
therapy to remove/destroy the tumor.

''They used a self-assembling solution (NHS-1) that was prepared using a RADA16-I synthetic dry powder obtained from MIT Zhang lab. The study describes experiments testing for how the solution works. They also compared the efficiency of the NHS-1 solution with saline and cautery treated controls. They found that in all cases the NHS-1 worked better.''
