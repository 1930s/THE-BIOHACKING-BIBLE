If you want to add a shared protocol for which nothing similar exists, you should create a page with the most general name possible.  For example if you are adding a western blotting protocol, call the page [[Western blot]] and not something specific like [[Joe Blogg's favorite western blot protocol]].  That way, other people can then add their experience and specific protocols to the general page you created.

See this [[Protocols/Template|template page]] for one potential way to layout your protocol.

You might think about adding some background information about the protocol such as when it might be useful, who designed it etc.

Finally, so that other people can find it, you should add it to the appropriate section on the protocols page.  For example, if you have an ''in vivo'' protocol, you might want to list your new protocol [http://openwetware.org/index.php?title=Protocols&action=edit&section=2 here].

Good luck and please let us know if you have any questions about using [[OpenWetWare]].
