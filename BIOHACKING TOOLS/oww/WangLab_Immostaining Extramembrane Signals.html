#Prepare the cells
#*HeLa cells were transfected with membrane-targeted or cytosolic MT1-MMP biosensor.
#Wash cells twice with PBS.
#Fixation, staining with primary antibody, permeabilization and blocking
*Primary antibody -----> fixation  ----->   blocking
**A) Chilled cells were incubated with GFP antibody (1:200 in CO2-independent medium without serum) at 4 C for 60 min.
**B) Wash three times with ice-cold PBS to remove unbound antibody; Fix cells with 4% paraformaldehyde at RT for 20 min.
**C) Wash three times with PBS.
**D) Blocking with 10% BSA for 30 min.
* Fixation -----> Primary antibody -----> blocking
**A) Fix cells with 4% paraformaldehyde at RT for 10 min.
**B) Wash three times with PBS; incubated with GFP antibody (1:200 in CO2-independent medium without serum) at 4 C for 60 min.
**C) Wash three times with ice-cold PBS to remove unbound antibody
**D) Blocking with 10% BSA for 30 min.
*Fixation -----> permeabilization  -----> Primary antibody ----> blocking
**A) Fix cells with 4% paraformaldehyde at RT for 10 min.
**B) Wash three times with PBS; permeabilize samples with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 at RT for 20 min
**C) Wash three times with PBS; blocking with 10% BSA for 30 min.
**D) Incubated with GFP antibody (1:200 in CO2-independent medium without serum) at 4 C for 60 min.
**E) Wash three times with ice-cold PBS to remove unbound antibody.
#Stained with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100) in 1% BSA-PBS at RM for 30-60 min.
#Remove secondary antibody; wash three times with PBS.
#Get ready mounting solution. Mount samples with antifade solution.
#Taking imaging under microscope.
