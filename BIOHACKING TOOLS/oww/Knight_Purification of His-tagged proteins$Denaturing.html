==Overview==
Denaturing purifications can often lead to better purity and yield.

==Materials==

===Lysis and column equilibration buffer===
*8 M urea
*100 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>
*10 mM Tris Cl
*10 mM imidazole (recommended by Kathleen, 9/27/2006)
*pH 8.0
*1 mM TCEP (add just before use)

===Wash buffer (Qiagen buffer C)===
*8 M urea
*100 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>
*10 mM Tris Cl
*10 mM imidazole (recommended by Kathleen, 9/27/2006, also use here?)
*pH 6.3
*1 mM TCEP (add just before use)

===Elution buffer (Qiagen buffer E)===
*8 M urea
*100 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>
*10 mM Tris Cl
*10 mM imidazole (recommended by Kathleen, 9/27/2006, also use here?)
*pH 4.5
*1 mM TCEP (add just before use)

===Notes===
*Solid urea to make up an 8M solution takes up a lot of volume so be conservative on how much H <sub>2</sub>O you start with (maybe 50% of final volume)
*Kathleen suggested supplementing the lysis buffer with 10mM imidazole to prevent nonspecific protein binding to the column.  Perhaps supplement the other buffers as well?
*The urea should be freshly prepared and deionized prior to use.
*The buffers should each be degassed before use.
*[http://www.piercenet.com/Products/Browse.cfm?fldID=02051012 TCEP] is not particularly stable in phosphate buffers, especially at neutral pH. Therefore, if TCEP is to be used in phosphate buffers, prepare the working solution immediately before use.

==Procedure==

===Grow and pellet cultures===
#Grow up an overnight 5mL culture in LB plus the appropriate antibiotic.
#The following morning, dilute back the culture 1:50 to the appropriate culture volume (which depends on the expected yield of the protein).
#*''Since I don't know what yield to expect, I arbitrarily did 50mL cultures assuming that my protein yield would be low and let it grow most of the day.  I try to catch the cultures around OD600nm 0.6.''
#Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 4000 x ''g'' for 15 mins.
#*''The Qiagen protocol didn't specify a temperature so I did 4&deg;C.''
#Decant supernatant.
#The cell pellet can be stored at -70&deg;C or processed immediately.
#*''I stored the pellet at -80&deg;C.  Long term storage at -80&deg;C might affect protein recovery???''

===Prepare solutions===
#Prepare 10M Urea.
#[[Knight:Deionization|Deionize]] the urea solution.
#Prepare lysis, wash and elution buffers (everything except reducing agent).
#[[Knight:pH meter/Measurement|Verify pH]] of lysis, wash and elution buffers.  Adjust if necessary.
#*''Dissociation of urea can lead to changes in pH.  The pH definitely needs to be checked prior to using the solutions.''
#Degas lysis, wash and elution buffers by placing under vacuum for one hour.
#*''Tom recommends doing the degassing step last.''
#Add TCEP to 1mM final concentration.
#*''TCEP is not stable in phosphate buffers at neutral pH.''
#Verify that pH hasn't changed.
#*''It is not known whether TCEP affects pH.  Degassing can affect pH in some cases.''

===Purify protein===
#Thaw pellet for 30 mins.
#*''Can thaw at room temperature since the next step happens at room temperature.  However, proteases will be less active if the pellet is thawed on ice.''
#*''The Qiagen protocol calls for 15 mins, but it was still frozen after 15 mins so I let it thaw for 30 mins.''
#Transferred to 2mL eppendorf tube.
#Resuspend in 1mL Lysis Buffer (see above).
#Add half or 1/4 protease inhibitor pellet.
#Incubate cells with agitation for 1 hr at room temperature.
#*''Use an orbis shaker on the bench to do this temp (usually kept in 37&deg; incubator).  Note that the shaker moves during shaking.''
#Centrifuge lysate at 10000 x ''g'' for 30 mins at room temperature.
#Add 600 &mu;L lysis buffer to Ni-NTA column to equilibrate.
#Centrifuge Ni-NTA column '''2 mins at 700 x ''g''''' with open lid to remove equilibration buffer.
#Save 20 &mu;L cleared lysate.
#Load 600 &mu;L cleared lysate to Ni-NTA column.
#Centrifuge Ni-NTA column '''5 mins at 700 x ''g''''' with closed lid.
#*''I typically repeat this step to load the rest of my cleared lysate.''
#*''Save flow through.''
#Add 600 &mu;L wash buffer to Ni-NTA column.
#Centrifuge Ni-NTA column '''2 mins at 700 x ''g''''' with open lid.
#*''Save flow through.''
#Add 600 &mu;L wash buffer to Ni-NTA column.
#Centrifuge Ni-NTA column '''2 mins at 700 x ''g''''' with open lid.
#*''Save flow through.''
#Tranfer to clean 1.5mL eppendorf tube.
#Add 200&mu;L elution buffer.
#Centrifuge Ni-NTA column '''2 mins at 700 x ''g''''' with open lid.
#*''Most of the protein should elute in this elution step.''

==Notes==
*Sauer lab uses a Qiagen Ni-NTA resin but this protocol uses spin columns.  (Smaller scale purification).
*Using the Qiagen Ni-NTA resin may be preferable for proteins with low yields.  
*A lower pH may be needed for elution.  For instance, aggregates should elute at pH 4.5 whereas monomers generally elute at pH 5.9.
*Contaminating proteins tend to be less of an issue in bacteria because there are few proteins with neighboring histidines that tend to bind to the column.
*20 year old spin columns don't work.  :)
*These columns can tolerate up to 20mM &beta;-mercaptoethanol or 1mM dithiothreitol.  Some people also seem to use 0.5-1mM TCEP with these columns.  TCEP appears to [http://www.piercenet.com/Products/Browse.cfm?fldID=02051012&WT.srch=1&WT.mc_id=go_TCEP_TCEP_brj&gclid=CPWzwfDkkIkCFUh6GgodyBUn6g more compatible] with NTA columns for his-tagged protein purification.
*Even when doing denaturing purifications, add 10mM imidazole to solutions to help with washing out non His tagged proteins.

==Troubleshooting and optimization==
*[[Knight:Deionization|Deionize]] urea solutions prior to use.
*Degas all buffers.
