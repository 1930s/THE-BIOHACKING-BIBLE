==Background==
96 well plates with transparent bases cost ~$4 each.  It would be desirable to reuse plates if possible. It was unclear if washing plates (bleach, followed by ethanol) led to unacceptable variation in readings.

==Method==
The GFP and absorbance at 600nm of every well on a new and a used plate that had been washed were measured.  The wells were empty.

==Results==
Histograms of the GFP readings for each plate are shown below.  Absorbance readings are not shown but showed similar trends to the GFP readings.

==Conclusions==
*The washed plate has a higher average background reading.
*The washed plate actually has a tighter distribution of readings.
*For most applications, washed plates are perfectly acceptable.
