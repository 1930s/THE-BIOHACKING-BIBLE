==T9002==
*Ligated sequential and double digests of T9002 to 3K3
*Transforming in MG1655

==E0240==
*Re-doing BB PCR with vent and phusion
**Mix for rxn (100uL):
#8uL 2.5mM dNTP
#20uL phusion buffer
#1.5uL f primer
#1.5uL r primer
#1uL DNA
#67uL H2O

*Just realized that we skipped the ligation step completely (3K3 and 1AK3).
**Doing that now, discarding PCR product.

==I2056==
*Re-culturing from plate

==I2055==
*Checked the sequences; none of them have the promoter.
*Waiting for primers to insert the promoter.
