==Assignment Due Mar 20==
'''Overview'''
*It may be too difficult for everyone to parse the entire set of examples by Tuesday.
*Instead, we will split into groups for a divide & conquer strategy.  
*Each group only needs to produce one script.  All group members should post their group's solution to individual notebook pages.
*Please provide rich and detailed documentation.  Try to match the source code style of the BioPython package (including docstrings). 
*Your script(s) should be able to properly parse the following:
**Input file 1 (March 13 exercise)
**A subset of input file 2: all mystery sequences contributed by the members of that group.
**Input file 3 (March 15 teaching staff contribution)

'''Group Assignments'''

'''Input files'''
*File 1: [[Media:070313_smd.fasta|smd.fasta]]
**This file contains the sequence from the [[Harvard:Biophysics_101/2007/03/13|March 13]] assigned for "manual" completion.
*File 2: [[Media:070315_class.fasta|class.fasta]]
**This file contains all student sequences.
*File 3: [[Media:070315_ms.fasta|ms.fasta]]
**This file contains two sequences.
**The first is an exonic sequence of a gene. Which gene is it? Is it mutated? Is the allele implicated in disease? Which diseases? 
**The second is a sequence of a gene. Which gene is it? Is it mutated? Is the allele implicated in disease? Which diseases?
