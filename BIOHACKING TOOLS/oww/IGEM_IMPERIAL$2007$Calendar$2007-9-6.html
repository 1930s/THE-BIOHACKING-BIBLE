==Debrief==

===GFP problem===
*Experimental design team had a meeting with Kirsten and Frank regarding the problem
*Have decided to concentrate on characterising DsRed Express
*All constructs will be cloned with DsRed Express and tested
**Should be able to start experimenting on DsRed Express constructs by start of week 11
*In the mean while will carry on looking for purified form of GFP mut3B 

===Meeting with Paul Freemont===
*12pm tomorrow
*Each team to make an agenda to talk on
**Must talk about what has been achieved in the past few weeks - no formal presentation

===Problems with experments===
*24 hour access to lab and  fluorometer to get better results as staggering not giving good results
*Freemont will arrange for a fluorometer that can be used 24 hours 
**No temperature control so can only carry out tests at room temperature and degradation experiments

===Data analysis===
*Dry lab team waiting for better results/data from the excperiments
*Current data not very useful - 24hr experiments would be very useful
*Currently writing a program to carry out data analysis

===Cell extract===
*Homemade cell extract was tested with pTet and pT7 constructs
**Results seemed ok but fluorescence was seen in the negative controls too in a fluorescence microscope
**Possible reasons - plates, the cell extract or the reaction mixture is contaminated
*Will carry out more tests on homemade cell extract to figure out where the fluorescence is from

===Vesicles===
*Characterising emulsion process - refining protocols to improve the process of vesicle formation
*Trying to come up with techniques to quantify the process of vesicle formation

===French iGEM team members visit===
*Hopefully the following people should be able to show them around and talk about the project:
**Lucas
**Alex
**Anthony
**Cheuk

===Other issues===
*Dry lab team should be free from modelling and data analysis by end of this week
**Can join the vesicles team and/or the experimental design team
*A log book placed with the fluorometer
**Need to write down full details on it about all the experiments being carried out - for record
