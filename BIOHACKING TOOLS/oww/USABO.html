== Introduction ==
Welcome to the USABO link exchange.  Collect any useful links you come across and put them up on this site.  Spend your time studying - not Googling fruitlessly - and help your colleagues do the same.

This page is intended as a resource for those preparing for the USA Biology Olympiad.  Others are welcome.

== [http://web.mit.edu/~kaull/www/usabo/IBO_Guide14_e.pdf IBO Syllabus]==
Contains a complete list of exam topics, rules, and background information.  Not to be missed.

== Theoretical Topics ==
=== Cell Biology (20%) ===
=== Plant Anatomy and Physiology (15%) ===
* [http://web.mit.edu/~kaull/www/usabo/plantinfo.doc Word] - Outline of plant chapters in Campbell
* [http://www.uri.edu/artsci/bio/plant_anatomy/ Plant Anatomy course website] - Contains a comprehensive image database of prepared slides.  The best way to learn microanatomy is to look at pictures and try to understand them...these are excellent prep for practical.

=== Animal Anatomy and Physiology (25%) ===
=== Ethology (5%) ===
=== Genetics and Evolution (20%) ===
* [http://web.mit.edu/~kaull/www/usabo/popuSim.zip Zip file] - contains DOS-based population genetics simulator.  Teaches selection, heterozygous advantage, genetic drift, and speciation.

=== Ecology (10%) ===
* [http://web.mit.edu/~kaull/www/usabo/Ecology.doc Word] - Outline of ecology chapters in Campbell

=== Biosystematics (5%) ===
* [http://web.mit.edu/~kaull/www/usabo/IBO_Guide14_e.pdf IBO Syllabus] - has the complete, official list of what you need to know.  (Yes, that list.  It's several pages long.  Memorize it now or kick yourself later.)
* [http://web.mit.edu/~kaull/www/usabo/BOT-pics.ppt LARGE ppt] - from Kay's high school biology team, written in 2003.  Pictorial tour of basic taxonomy.
* [http://biology.clc.uc.edu/courses/bioall/plant%20families.htm Plant taxonomy] - excellent summary.  Note that a couple family names are different from the IBO list.
* [http://www.colby.edu/info.tech/BI211/Bio211.html Plant taxonomy course] - very comprehensive, lots of pictures and a huge list of links.
* [http://courses.washington.edu/vertebra/451/labs/bird_labs_03.htm#bird_key Bird taxonomy]
* [http://www.insecta.com/insecta/tree.htm Insect family tree] - good brief descriptions.

=== Textbooks ===
The overall content of the USABO exams comes from the leading textbook in biology, Campbell and Reece's Biology. The best thing students can do to prepare for the competition is thoroughly study the textbook. Students should attempt to learn the charts and formulas in the book and be able to reproduce them.
