====Plate Reader (Light Scattering)====
Stephanie set up another plate reader for fluorescence. One of the things she is testing is choosing ridiculous wavelengths to see if we can get light scattering data that correlates to cell growth.

*[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_J00450 J04450]
*[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_J23039 J23039]>[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_T9002 T9002]

====Digesting the J04450 and J-T====
George digested the [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_J00450 J04450] with SpeI and PstI; he also digested the [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_J23039 J23039]>[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_T9002 T9002] with XbaI and PstI.

====Sequencing the Promoters: R0011, R0051, R0052====
George and Stephanie sent the [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_R0011 R0011], [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_R0051 R0051], and the [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_R0052 R0052] for sequencing.

====Dephosphorylating the J04450 and J-T====
George dephosphorylated the J04450 and the J-T with Antarctic Phosphotase and then heat inactivated the AP. Silly George, AP is for vectors not inserts. Redo it tomorrow.

====Liquid Cultures of R-P constructs and J-T====
George grew liquid cultures of the following:
*[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_R0011 R0011] <[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_P0340 P0340] colony #2
*[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_R0051 R0051] <[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_P0140 P0140] colony #1
*[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_R0051 R0051] <[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_P0340 P0340] colony #1
*[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_R0052 R0052] <[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_P0140 P0140] colony #2 Lower Right
*[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_R0052 R0052] <[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_P0340 P0340] colony #1 Upper Right
*[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_R0052 R0052] <[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_P0340 P0340] colony #1 Lower Right
*[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_J23039 J23039] <[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_T9002 T9002] 

The Upper/Lower Right is due to the fact that the colony PCR plate had duplicates of those colonies and it was unclear which colony was correct (at least, the PCR and gel was correct). So, George took both samples and labeled one as coming from the upper right of the plate (when viewed with the handwriting going the correct way) versus lower right.

====Miniprepping the R-P and JT====
George miniprepped the R-P and [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_J23039 J23039] <[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_T9002 T9002]  constructs that were grown overnight in preparation for building the RFP+JT and tetR+JT constructs.

[[User:GeorgeXu#Miniprep_and_Nanodrop_of_JT_and_the_R-P_constructs|George's notebook entry]]

====Digesting the R-P and JT====
George digested the R-P constructs with SpeI and PstI; he also digested the [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_J23039 J23039] <[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_T9002 T9002]  with XbaI and PstI in preparation for building the RFP+JT and tetR+JT constructs.

====Dephosphorylating the R-P constructs====
George dephosphorylated the R-P constructs with Antarctic Phosphotase and then he heat inactivated the AP.

====Clonewell and Vacufuge of R-P constructs and JT====
George clonewelled and vacufuged the R-P constructs. Unfortunately, he forgot to include JT and had to re-use the same gel.

====Ligation and Transformation tetR-JT and RFP-JT constructs====
George Roche ligated the following:
*([http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_R0051 R0051] <[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_P0140 P0140]) <([http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_J23039 J23039] <[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_T9002 T9002])

and then transformed them into BL21.

George colony PCR'ed the tetR-JT and RFP-JT constructs.

===7/20/07===
====Liquid Cultures of R-P and JT parts====
George grew liquid cultures of all the working R-P parts (according to the colony PCR). He discovered that the R52's were incorrect (sequences + wrong selection plate). The parts he grew up were:
