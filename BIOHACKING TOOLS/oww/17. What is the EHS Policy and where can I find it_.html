The MIT EHS Policy, approved by the Academic Council, signals MIT’s commitment to environmental, health, and safety stewardship in research, teaching and operations.  The policy was development by an Ad Hoc EHS Subcommittee if MIT’s EHS Council.  Co-chaired by the Vice President for Research and Associate Provost and Managing Director for Environmental Programs/Senior Counsel, this subcommittee includes senior faculty and administrators.  All of MIT’s EHS activities – compliance, good practices and positive initiatives – are directed toward achieving the goals described by the policy.

The Policy can be viewed online at: [http://mit.edu/ehs-ms/ http://mit.edu/ehs-ms/].
