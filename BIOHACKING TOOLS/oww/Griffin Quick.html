== Brief Bio ==
My full name is Griffin Kyle Quick and I was born March 7, 1987 in Dallas, Texas.  At the age of two, my family moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana, and still lives there today.  I attended Carroll High School, graduating 6th out of 322 students, while also playing varsity football and baseball for 3 years apiece.  I chose to come to Purdue University in the fall of 2005 over Rose-Hulman Insitute of Technology, my dad's alma mater, because of the great research opportunities available and the big-school atmosphere.  I am currently a junior in Biomedical Engineering at Purdue with my interests including biomaterials and nanotechnology.  In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with my friends, going to the Co-Rec to play basketball or work out, and watching sports.

== Prior Lab Experience ==
This is the first time I will be taking on a research position; however, I am not lacking in laboratory experience.  I have completed labs in chemistry, physics, and fluid mechanics along with labs associated with my BME courses.  The BME curriculum includes labs focusing on Biomaterials, Biomechanics ofsu Hard and Soft Tissues, and Bioelectricity.  Currently, I am in a BME lab that is structured around Bioheat and Mass Transfer.

== Prior Industry Experience ==
In the summer of 2007, I obtained an internship at Fort Wayne Metals Research Products Corp.  There I worked on testing the capabilities and compatibility of different medical grade wires along with designing a testing apparatus to simulate the wear and tear on wires in a particular situation within the body.

== Goals ==
I am very excited to be working in a lab that combines two of my greatest interests within the field of Biomedical Engineering.  Throughout my time in the lab, I hope to accomplish a great deal of things including understanding how research in the field is conducted, finding out whether or not research is a direction I want to go, and establishing great relationships with other highly dedicated researchers.
