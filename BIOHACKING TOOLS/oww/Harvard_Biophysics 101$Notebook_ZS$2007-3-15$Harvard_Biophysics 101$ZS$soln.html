Association with KCNS3 on Chromosome 2p24
Using a positional candidate gene approach based on the linkage findings from Xu et al. (2001), Hao et al. (2005) analyzed 3 SNPs in the KCNS3 gene (603888) in 228 individuals with extreme airway hyperresponsiveness and 444 controls, all drawn from the same population used by Xu et al. (2001). In single-SNP analysis, the rs1031771 G allele (OR, 1.42; p = 0.006) and the rs1031772 T allele (OR, 1.40; p = 0.018) were associated with a significantly higher risk of airway hyperresponsiveness; haplotype analysis also detected a significant association (p = 0.006). Hao et al. (2005) suggested that SNPs located in the 3-prime downstream region of KCNS3 have a significant role in the etiology of airway hyperresponsiveness.
