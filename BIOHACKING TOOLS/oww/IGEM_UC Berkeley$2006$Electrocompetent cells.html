==50 mL scale Electrocompetent cells==
Combine 50 mL of LB + antibiotic and 2 mL of saturated overnight cell culture<br>
Place in 37 C shaker until OD reaches between 0.8 and 1.2<br>

#45 mL of solution (described above)
#Centrifuge at 8000 RPM for 3 minutes
#Save pellet, dispose of excess fluid
#Fill to 30 mL with 10% glycerol
#Vortex 
#Centrifuge at 7500 RPM for 3 minutes
#Save pellet, dispose of excess fluid 
#Fill to 30 mL with 10% glycerol 
#Vortex 
#Centrifuge at 7500 RPM for 3 minutes 
#Save pellet, dispose of excess fluid

==1 mL scale Electrocompetent cells==
Grow 5 mL of bacteria in LB or 2YT + antibiotics to OD=~1.0<br>
Do all subsequent steps on ice.<br>
10% glycerol needs to be very clean, sterile, and cold.

#Cool on ice
#transfer 1 mL to an eppendorf, spin 20 sec at full speed
#dump supe, resuspend in 1 mL 10% glycerol
#spin, dump supe, resuspend in 1 mL 10% glycerol
#spin, dump supe, resuspend in 100 uL of 10% glycerol

Ready for electroporation.
