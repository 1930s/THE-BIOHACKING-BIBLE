==Schedule==
This is an estimation that each fluorescence experiment will have to be prepared one night before and will take approximatly 1 day to run an experiment. Each experiment should be repeated ~4 times, however, this can be run on the same plate. In addition, there is space on the plate for 2 experiments to be run parrell, so for example, we could test two strains together.
==Week 6==
===Making Constructs===

==Week 7==
===Day 1===
*Prepare cultures and grow over night
===Day 2===
*Characterisation of promoters. There needs to be three promoters tested. We may consider using the BBa_F2620 which has already been characterised.
*Standard protocols and calibration curves required for each of the promoters.
===Day 3===
*Repeats.
*Prepare cultures for '''device 1'''.
===Day 4===
*'''Device 1''' -Calibration curves.
===Day 5===
*'''Device 1''' -Standard protocol, can run two experiments at once, so opportunity to run two strains parrell.
*Prepare the '''Device 2'''

==Week 8==
===Day 1===
*'''Device 2''' -Calibration Curves
===Day 2===
*'''Device 2''' -Standard protocol, however, there are two inputs and so the complexity of the testing is increased. Can only run one experiment at a time.
===Day 3===
*'''Device 2''' -Test device in different chassies.
