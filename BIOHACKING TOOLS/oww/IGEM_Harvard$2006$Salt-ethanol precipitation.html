''Note: this protocol is preliminary''

==Small-scale separation using salt:ethanol precipitation==
*Add 0.25 mass equiv of 5 M NaCl (assume 1.19 g/mL density)
** ''example: 100 {{ul}} * 0.25 / 1.19 = 21 {{ul}}''
*Add 0.5 mass equiv of ethanol (assume density of 0.79 g/mL)
** ''example: 100 {{ul}} * 0.5 / 0.79 = 63.3 {{ul}}''
*Incubate on ice 10 min
*Centrifuge at 15000 rpm for 10 min at 4Â°C
*Carefully remove supernatant with pipette
*Resuspend in 50 {{ul}} 1x folding buffer
Stock is now concentrated 2x, but we probably suffered some losses. Run a gel and check spot-density of the bands to determine yield.
