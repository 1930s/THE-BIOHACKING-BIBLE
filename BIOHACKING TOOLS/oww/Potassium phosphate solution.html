==Introduction and Purpose==
For use in [[Terrific Broth]] this mixture should be diluted 1:10 in final mixture

===Ingredients===
For the preparation of 1 liter of potassium phosphate solution the final desired concentrations are:
*0.17 Molar monobasic potassium phospate (23.135 grams/liter KH2PO4, molecular weight=136.09 grams/mole)
*0.72 Molar dibasic potassium phosphate (125.410 grams/liter K2HPO4, molecular weight=174.18 grams/mole).

Add the dry ingredients to a 1 liter graduated cylinder and added double distilled water until a final volume of 1 liter is reached. Sterile filter this solution through a 0.22 micron filter.
