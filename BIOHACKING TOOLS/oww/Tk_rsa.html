* Cut all assembly parts with XbaI and PstI, 37°C / 20 minutes
* Heat kill XbaI, PstI, 80°C / 20 minutes
* Cut vector backbone with EcoRI and SpeI
* Heat kill EcoRI, SpeI 65°C / 20 minutes


* Bind EcoRI -- XbaI end fragment to biotin support (or cut at XbaI on the support)


* Loop for all parts (Loop is 2+ hours)(finish is 1 hour to elution)
** ligate new part to the support (form initial XbaI cut site, or form mixed site)
** part + ligase + ATP, 25°C / 20 minutes
** Heat kill ligase 65°C / 20 minutes
** Klenow + dNTPs to remove 3' PstI cut ends and blunt unreacted XbaI sites 25°C / 15 minutes
** Add EDTA; Heat kill Klenow 75°C / 20 minutes
** Cut SpeI 37°C / 20 minutes (release SpeI -- PstI fragment)
** Heat kill SpeI 65 °C / 20 minutes
* ligate SpeI / EcoRI cut backbone
* Heat kill ligase 65°C / 20 minutes
* Cut EcoRI 37°C / 20 minutes
* Heat kill EcoRI 65°C / 20 minutes
* Elute from biotin support with 10 &mu;l ligation buffer
* Ligate to circularize: ligase + ATP 25°C / 20 minutes
* Transform


* Fragment assembly:
* Cut with XbaI 65°C / 20 minutes
* Elute from the support
* Fall into a second assembly using this as a part


* Biotin oligos:
* RSA-F: 5' biotin GTT TCT TCG AAT TCG CGG CCG CTT CTA GAG GTT TCT  3'
* RSA-R: 3'        AGA AAC CTC TAG AAG CGG CCG CGA ATT CGA AGA AAC  5'
* GAATTC and TCTAGA sites


* side reactions:
** bound oligos reacting with each other  -- very bad, will be recut and become active **
** insert + vector religating  -- reduce efficiency
** insert + insert ligating  -- reduce efficiency **
** bound oligos ligating with vector  -- reduce efficiency **
** bound oligos reacting with insert (desirable)
* high concentrations of vector + insert wrt bound oligos is desirable --> 50% yield
** ** side reactions eliminated with non-palindromic overlaps



To do:
* PCR of backbone plasmid with biotin primers, cut with E/S, heat kill
** purify out uncut/small fragments with strep beads
* Locate DNA for test assemblies
** cut with X/P, heat kill
* Anneal and bind RSA-F and RSA-R oligos to biotin beads, cut with XbaI, heat kill


Assembly test:
R0040 B0032 E0040 B0011


* 1 Jan
** PCR of pSB1AC3 backbone
** pick R0040,  B0032, E0040, B0011 onto single colonies
* 2 Jan plan
** Cut and prep pSB1AC3 backbone with E/S
** Pick single colonies from part plates, grow o/n
** Anneal RSA-F, RSA-R
** Cut RSA fragment with XbaI
** Bind RSA fragment to biotin beads, aliquot
** Check repairs, Sigma, Pierce orders
