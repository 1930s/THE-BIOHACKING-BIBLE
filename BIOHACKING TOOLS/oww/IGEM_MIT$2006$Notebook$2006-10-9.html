==to do==

#LC the "banana cells" and the "mint cells"...cells w/ both precursor & product generation!! : )
#*pick colonies and LC from the 2 ligations above...should be 8 plates to LC (4 in top10 and 4 in IK).  we probably want to do a ridiculous amount of LCs from the 250/400 plates b/c there probably won't be very many that are correct, and we'll instantly be able to tell which are right and which are wrong so it doesn't hurt to do a lot of them.   [i REALLY hope there are transformants this time!!]
#*('''AG''') I don't know if it is such a good idea to start them so early.  Is anyone gonna be around later in the day?  I'm coming in, hopefully, around 9AM. -André
#*('''KB''')I made the LCs at 1 pm. transformants were scarce, but made 8 "mint" IK LCs and 1 sketchy "banana" top10 LC.
#isolate the IAGD: '''Veena'''
#*plate a few cells from each colony of transformants on an A/C plate
#*LC the colonies that didn't grow on the A/C plate
#**('''KB''') there are only 3 transformants. I am going to LC each in Kan and A/C (rather than plate). We will know tomorrow if any are Kan^+ and A/C^-, and this way you won't need to come back in today to do the 3 hour plating/growing step.

==List of Parts/Numbers==

'''396''': 30.BAT2 (w/ B mut)

'''397''': 30.BAT2.30 (w/ B mut)

'''398''': 30.BAT2.30.THI3 (w/ B, T muts)
*('''KB'''): we actually never mutated the T ''(successfully)''

'''399''': 30.BAT2.30.THI3.15 (w/ B, T muts)
*('''KB'''): we never attached a terminator/made this part

'''400''': Prom.30.BAT2.30.THI3.15 (w/ B, T muts)
*('''KB'''): we actually never mutated the T ''(successfully)''

'''298''': pchBA.15 (w/ pA mut)

'''299''': 30.pchBA.15 (w/ pA mut)

'''300''': Prom.30.pchBA.15 (w/ pA mut)

'''319''': 32.pchBA.15

'''320''': Prom.32.pchBA.15

Are the glycerols the only parts that we actually have?
*('''KB'''): yes. make sure to check the new box for more recent parts (like inverter stuff, etc.) 

Also, whenever I streak these, should I just streak the IKs if there is an IK version and non-IK version?
*('''KB'''): isn't megean just going to extract the dna?? so does it matter? i'd say use IK anyway though.

==General Part Status Report==

It makes a lot more sense for this to be done in Excel.  I will do this and put it on in a bit.  -André
*('''KB'''): cool. thanks!
