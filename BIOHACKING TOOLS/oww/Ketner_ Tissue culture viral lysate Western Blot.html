== SDS-PAGE Westerns ==
=== Overview ===
A Western Blot allows for the semiquantitative determination of protein expression.
Crude cell lysates are loaded into a polyacrylamide gel containing a denaturing agent which give all the proteins a net negative charge. A current can then be passed through the gel and the proteins will migrate through the gel, with the largest proteins traveling the slowest, resulting in a lane where proteins become separated on the basis of their weight. The proteins can then be transferred from the gel onto a membrane (often nitrocellulose or PVDF), which can then by incubated with an antibody directed against the protein of interest. By using a detector conjugated to an antibody one can now detect specifically the protein of interest.

===Procedure===
====Prepare Samples====
*Boil Samples for 5 min, cool on ice 1 min, spin 1 min
*Ladders: 8ul ladder + 8ul 2x PLS
**High mol weight 30KDa - 220 KDa
**Low mol weight 6.5KDa - 45 Kda

====Prepare Gel====
This will vary according to gel apparatus
*Clean and assemble gel apparatus
*Boil agar to create plug
*Drip agar down side of cassette with pasteur pipette, just enough to form seal
*[[Create running gel]]
*Layer isopropanol on top to remove bubbles
*[[When hardened create stacking gel]]
*Cast stacking gel with comb, remove comb when hardened
*Fill with 1x running buffer
*Load samples and run at 50-120V

====Transfer to membrane====
specific for apparatus
*overnight, constant voltage of 40mA

====Probe Blot with antibodies====
*Block with 5% milk in PBS-T for 1hr
*Primary in 5% milk in PBS-T for 2 hrs
*Wash 3x with 5% milk in PBS-T for 5 min each
*Secondary in 3% milk in PBS-T for 45 min
*Wash 3x with 5% milk in PBS-T for 5 min each
*Wash 1x with PBS-T for 5 min

====Develop Blot and document====
specific to secondary antibody
