'''Please post any ideas you have about OpenWetWare community development here.'''
==Community Portal==
*An improved [[OpenWetWare:Community Portal]] would go a long way towards encouraging the growth of the "back-end" user community.  We could use the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_Portal wikipedia community portal] as a model.

==Seminar Series==
*Can [http://syndicateblog.petersons.com/wordpress/index.php/embedding-google-videos/ embed google video on a site] (without even a google logo on it or anything) and they will stream for free, so we could host videos there if we wanted.
*At the last steering committee meeting we brought up looking into the Singapore/MIT alliance rooms that already have the built-in AV equipment.

==User pages==
*Not sure if this belongs here, but it would be great if we could get people to put at least a small amount of info on their user pages, particularly those who contribute regularly. I think accountability for/credibility of info on OWW  kind of depends on this. Otherwise, we should just allow editing to be anonymous. Not too much info is required for this, just a short bit about who they are.--[[User:Kathmc|Kathleen]]
**We've been trying to encourage this as much as possible.  Every email that goes out to a new user includes a line encouraging them to start editing their user page.  In fact, with many new users, we put a line on their user page for them when we create the account.  However, many of the recent influx of OWW users are [[BE.109]] students, and so I haven't been doing this because they are supposed to put something on their user page as part of their assignment.  Regardless, I agree that this is a good idea.  --[[User:Rshetty|RS]]

==Custom Recent Changes==
At the sub-group meeting on 2/22/06, we discussed having the ability to track changes for customized groups of pages.  One thought is to have all the possible namespace in the drop-down list on the recent changes site.  There are a variety of things we could do, here are just a few to begin.

#Use Existing Functionality.  We can track categories by going to a particular category page and tracking related changes.  Thus, the endy lab could have a category of all its pages, and have a link to the related changes page for that category.  
#*Advantages
#**Pages can have multiple categories
#**No additional coding (don't have to worry about updates, et cetera)
#*Disadvantages
#**Recent changes page is unchanged.  Harder to figure out where to go.
#**Must categorize pages that you want searched.  Causes ugly categorization thing at bottom.
#***Is there a way to make categories visible only in the code, not on the page?
#We can use an existing extension, such as [http://s23.org/wiki/Custom_Recent_Changes this] to encode custom recent changes functionality.  What this does is makes a particular page a recent changes page for all pages with a specified prefix.  This would, to a first approximation, let us track changes for all the different spaces that material is on.
#*Advantages
#**Don't have to label each page with a category
#*Disadvantages
#**Each page will have only one possible recent changes
#**Won't work with redirects (I think).
#**Could become broken every time we update
#We could write our own functionality.
#*Advantages
#**Could customize whatever we wanted
#*Disadvantages
#**Lots of work
#**Needs maintenance, yet another thing we need to worry about.

Anyways, let me know what you think
