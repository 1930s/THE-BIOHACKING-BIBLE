[[Aminoglycoside]] antibiotic. G418/G-418 (generic name) is the same molecule as Geneticin® (registered trademark of Invitrogen Corp.).

==Experimental==

* '''stock solution''': 200mg/mL (1000X), stored at -20 C
* '''working concentration''': working concentration depends on organism and purpose of antibiotic application; stable at RT

:* bacteria selection: 8-16 µg/ml

:* plant cell maintenance: 10 µg/ml
:* plant cell selection: 25-50 µg/ml

:* mammalian cell maintenance: 200 µg/ml
:* mammalian cell selection: 400 µg/ml (range: 300-1000 µg/ml)
:* yeast: after transformation incubate culture at 30°C for 2-3 hours and then plate on [[YPD]] containing 200 mg/L (=µg/ml) G418.

==Description==

* Gentamycin analog, used to select for the KanMX marker in yeast.
* '''mode of action''': irreversibly binds to 80S ribosomal subunit, disrupting proofreading.
* '''mode of resistance''': ''neo/kan'' gene is an aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase, which inactivates G418, [[neomycin]] and [[kanamycin]] by phosphorylation.
