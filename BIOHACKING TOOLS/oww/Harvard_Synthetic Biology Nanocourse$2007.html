==Instructors==
*Nanocourse Lecturers: [[User:Geochurch|George Church]] ([http://arep.med.harvard.edu/gmc/email.html talk]), [[User:wmshih|William Shih]] ([[User_talk:wmshih|talk]]) (co-director), and [[User:PamSilver|Pamela Silver]] ([[User_talk:PamSilver|talk]]) (co-director)

==Course Description== 
Synthetic biology explores the design rules for building artificial behavior of biomolecular systems through cycles of construction and comparison of intended versus observed behaviors. The ability to synthesize biomimetic behavior is an important benchmark for biological understanding. This course will introduce strategies for 
engineering cellular and molecular systems and will explore current and future applications for synthetic biology approaches.

==Course Project==
*The course project will be a 1-2 page proposal describing a synthetic biology project. Feel free to use figures in your proposal if it can clarify critical concepts for your readers. You should use the course lectures, course readings and your own experience to come up with a proposal. Your grade in this nanocourse will '''not''' be based on the validity of this proposal. Rather, we just ask that you make a best effort to propose a set of experiments to address an important problem. We will discuss these proposals during the discussion section of the course.
*All students should post their proposal, in Adobe PDF form, to this wiki page by noon on Thursday, 2007 October 25. (This is the day before the discussion section).
*Students and instructors should do their best to read each proposal before class on Friday. On Friday, 2007 October 26, each student will have a chance to informally present their proposed experiments to the entire class. Currently there are 8 students registered to participate on the second day, so we should be able to get through every student proposal.
*To see some potential project ideas, please browse through the project and brainstorming pages of former iGEM teams. If you decide to adopt one of those ideas, you should propose a significant improvement or alteration that represents value added to the original idea. Be sure to credit the sources for your inspirations. Here are some example links (everyone, please feel free to add more or to reorganize):
