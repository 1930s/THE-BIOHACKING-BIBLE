Don't know much about this domain... here are some links:

** [http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAfold.cgi RNAfold] The standard in RNA folding, only one sequence
** [http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold/old/rna/ Mfold] Good old traditional RNA tool, only one sequence
** [http://www.daimi.au.dk/~compbio/rnafold/ PFold] can fold multiple alignments 
** [http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~wash/RNAz/ RNAz] like RNAfold, strange SVM, but can be applied to the whole genome
** [http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/papers/SUPPLEMENTS/ncRNA/ RNAz predictions conserved in human/mouse/rat/dog/chicken] This is a simple bed-file that you can view on UCSC, overlap with anything, very nice data
** [http://selab.wustl.edu/cgi-bin/selab.pl?mode=software#qrna QFold] similar to RNAz, slower?
