==Miniprep==
*Miniprep & preservation: I7100.

==Digestion Test: I7100 and E0040==
*I7100 and E0040.
*EcoR I single digestion.
*Digestion system contains (totally 20uL): 2uL 10*H, 0.5uL EcoR I, 3uL plasmid, 15uL ddH2O.
===electrophoresis result===
*from ''Left'' to ''Right'':
#I7100 @ EcoRI
#E0040 @ EcoRI
#I7100 plasmid
#E0040 plasmid
#Marker

==Double Digesting E0040 and I7100 for ligation ==
*Method choice test :Oven or Water bath
*Digesting E0040 and I7100 with EcoR1/SpeI and EcoRI/XbaI.
*Digestion system contains (totally 20uL): 
#3uL 10*H, 1uL EcoRI, 1uL SpeI, 6uL plasmid, 10uL ddH2O.
#3uL 10*M, 1uL EcoRI, 1uL XbaI, 6uL plasmid, 10uL ddH2O.
*37℃ culutre for 12 hours.
===electrophoresis result===
*from ''Left'' to ''Right'':
#oven:I7100 @ EcoRI/XbaI
#Oven:E0040 @ EcoRI/SpeI
#Water Bath: I7100 @ EcoRI/XbaI
#Water Bath: E0040 @ EcoRI/SpeI
#Marker

===conclusion===
:Water bath is better.

=OriT Knock Out=
*By Xu Anting and Liu Ting
==Chromosome Extraction==
*Received chromosome of F/R751/pSC101 strain and diluted in 1:50 ddH2O (pH 8.0).

==Travel to Grassland!==
*Everyone at Room 307 in Biotech Building planned to have a travel for three days.  All experiment suspended ^o^
