== Postdoctoral Associates ==

        <p>Inquiries regarding opportunities for postdoctoral research in our
        laboratory are welcome. In general strong backgrounds in fields related
        to Metabolic Engineering or Bioinformatics are required. Postdoctoral
        Associates in our group are expected to work independently and provide
        leadership for more junior investigators. They will be responsible
        for carry a project from inception of an idea to publication. To
        assist our Postdoctoral Associates in moving their careers forward, the
        laboratory offers an exciting environment for those seeking to integrate
        metabolic function with gene expression. Under the umbrella of Metabolic
        Engineering, our group brings together specialists in biochemistry, molecular
        biology, physiology, bioreaction network analysis, and bioinformatics.
        Our vigorous group discussions provide insight from many angles to sharpen
        the focus of each project and maximize opportunity for success.
        Alumni from this lab have moved on to outstanding positions in industry
        and academia.</p>

        <p>Although there is flexibility, at present we are specifically
        seeking individuals with expertise in the following areas:</p>
        <ul style="color:maroon; font:bold">
        <li>
        Mass spectrometry techniques for determining isotopic enrichment
        in metabolic studies.&nbsp;</li>
        
        <li>
        Molecular biology of mammalian cells - especially transfection and
        related techniques.&nbsp;</li>
        
        <li>
        Hepatic physiology and biochemistry - especially metabolic flux
        measurements.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Address inquiries to our group via e-mail at <tt>gnswebpage-www@mit.edu</tt>.
        MIT is an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer.</p>
        
== Doctoral candidates ==

        <p>Before joining our group as a doctoral candidate, students must be accepted
        into an graduate degree program at MIT.  Most of the doctoral candidates in our
        laboratory are in the department of Chemical Engineering.  However, we also have
        researchers from the departments of Biology, Chemistry, and Bioengineering.  If
        you are interested in joining our laboratory, but have not been accepted to MIT
        yet, please contact us and we will be happy to advise you in your application
        process.</p>
        
== Visiting Researchers or Students ==

        <p>Opportunities for specialized research projects for highly qualified
        visitors may be available.  Address inquiries to our group via e-mail at
        <tt>gnswebpage-www@mit.edu</tt>.
