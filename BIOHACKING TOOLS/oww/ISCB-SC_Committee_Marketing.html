The [[ISCB-SC:Activities|ISCB Student Council Newsletter]] is a quarterly electronic publication for Student Council members. It contains information about new and ongoing projects of the Student Council leadership, it announces upcoming events and reviews past activities. We also include links to resources on the web that we think are valuable for students in the field of computational biology, as well as key dates for conferences and workshops. The newsletter send out to our members at the end of March, June, September and December. It is also available on the [[ISCB-SC:Activities|wiki]] and on our [http://www.iscbsc.org/newsletters/| website].
