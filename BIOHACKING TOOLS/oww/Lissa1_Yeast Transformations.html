'''Day 1.'''  
#	Inoculate the yeast strain into 5 mL of SC selection medium and incubate overnight on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm (but 230 is fine) at 30 degrees.  

'''Day 2.'''  
#	Get the OD600 of your yeast.  If it looks like the reading will be over an OD of 1, do a 1:10 dilution and multiply the OD600 reading by 10.  
#	Use this to figure out how many cells you have per mL.  If your OD is .1, you have 10^6 cells/mL.
#	Transfer 50 mL of 1x YPD in to a culture flask and add 2.5*10^8 cells (figure out the volume from step b) to make a final dilution of 5*10^6 cells/mL.
#	Incubate your flask on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm at 30 degrees until the cells have divided at least twice (you’ll know because the OD will double twice).  It takes about 3-5 hours.
#	When the OD is 2*10^7 (or it’s doubled), harvest cells by centrifuging at 3000g for 5 min (this is a setting of 2.5 on the big centrifuge).  You need a large centrifuge tube for this.
#	Wash your cells in 25 mL of sterile water, and centrifuge again, same as before.
#	Resuspend in 1 mL of sterile water. 
#	Boil a 1 mL sample of carrier DNA (salmon sperm in our case) for 5 minutes and chill on ice…. Unless this has already been done in which case the carrier is in the -20 freezer.
#	Transfer the cell suspension to a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube and microfuge for 30 sec.  Discard the supernatant.
#	Add water to a final volume of 1 mL and vortex to resuspend. You may need to use a different volume depending on your OD.  
#	Pipette 100 uL samples in to eppendorfs (1 per transformation), microfuge at top speed for 30 seconds and discard supernatant.  
#	Make up Transformation Mixture. 
##	Each tube will get:
###	240 uL PEG 3500 50% w/v
###	36 uL LiAc 1.0 M
###	50 uL boiled SS-carrier DNA
###	34 uL plasmid DNA plus water
####	total = 360 uL
##	If you are doing 5 transformations, here’s what you do:
####	A master mix of:
#####	1440 uL PEG
#####	216 uL LiAc
#####	300 uL carrier DNA
##	Put 326 uL of the master mix in to a tube for each of your transformations.  In to the tubes you can add the appropriate plasmid/water mix to get the last 34 uL.
#	VORTEX.
#	Incubate in a 42 degree water bath for 40 mins.
#	Microfuge at 13 for 30 seconds and remove supernatant.  
#	Pipette 200 uL sterile water in to each tube, stir pellet with tip and vortex.
#	Plate appropriate amount of cell suspension on to SC selection medium. 
#	Incubate at 30 degrees for 3 or 4 days.  
#	Hope that it works!
