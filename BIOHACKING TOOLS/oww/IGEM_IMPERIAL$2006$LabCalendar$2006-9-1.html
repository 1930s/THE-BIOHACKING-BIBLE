 <u>'''TO DO:'''</u>
 *Testing of T9002, J37016, J37020, S01656(contd. from Thursday), J37015, J37015RS
 *Mini & Maxiprep of new J37024 (CHECK the miniprep gel straight after !)
 *Ligation & electroporation of J37022, J37025 (using new J37024)
 *Finish biosensor protocol from Thursday (read fluorescence)
 </font color>

==Testing T9002/J37016/J37020==

*OD of o/n culture of T9002: 2.00
*OD of o/n culture of J37016: 2.00
*OD of o/n culture of J37020: 2.00

*Put in the shaker at 9.25. Take out at 11.25.

After 2 hrs:

*Took OD of cultures, innoculated into 25ml, placed in shaker at 11:45. To be taken out at 3:45.

==Miniprep of J37024 to check ligations==
[[Image:0109MiniJ37024wnew.jpg|750px]]

==Maxiprep==
*Maxiprep 3 samples of J37024 II
*Throw away original maxiprep of J37024 (I) as minipreps show it to have not been successful

==Ligations==
*All three samples of J37024 II inserted into vectors 3O Predator (AiiA contstruct for predator cell J37025) and 16P (AiiA test construct J37022)

==LoxP PCR==
*We altered the annealing temperatures once more in a final attempt to get this PCR to work

5 cycles at 37{{c}}<br>
5 cycles at 58{{c}}<br>
20 cycles at 68{{c}}

*It seems that it may have at last worked because we have a band at the expected size (~1kb)
*However this band is smeared so we cannot be sure of its success - but it certainly is promising nonetheless
*We will now attempt the PCR fusion on Monday (04/09), which hopefully will give us the completed construct.

==Rosetta competent cells==

*We were only able to get 3 colonies from the BL21 competent cells that were transformed yesterday. Therefore it was decided that we should try another type of cell as well.
*The Rosetta competent cells were electroporated with S01656, and will be cultured up on Sunday in order that we can perform a Western blot on Monday.
