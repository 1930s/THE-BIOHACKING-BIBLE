==Mode of Action==
Inhibits the formation of cross-links in the peptidoglycan layer (which provides rigidity to the cell wall).  Most effective against cells in log phase growth (since this is when new cross-links are being formed), and has little effect on cells in stationary phase.

==Mechanism of Resistance==

Expression of [[&beta;-lactamase]] neutralizes ampicillin.  The resistance gene is named ''bla'' or ''amp<sup>R</sup>''.  When this enzyme is expressed on a high-copy number plasmid there is significant diffusion into the extracellular medium.  As a result non-resistant satellite colonies may form around larger resistant colonies.

==Stock Solution==

Typical concentrations of ampicillin are 50 ug/ml for low copy plasmids and 100 ug/ml for high copy plasmids.  Stock solutions are typically at 100 mg/ml, so that 1 ml of antibiotic can be added to 1 liter of broth or agar.  Stock solutions made in 50% alcohol remain liquid at -20 C and are easy to pipet.  Cool agar to 55C or below prior to adding antibiotic.

Ampicillin available from Sigma A-9518 (Ampicillin sodium salt), FW 371.39. To make 100ml of 100 mg/ml stock solution, dissolve 10 g of ampicillin in 50 ml of water and 50 ml of 100% ethanol.

==Stability==

Culture plates with ampicillin can be stored at 2-8 째C for up to two weeks. Stock solutions may be stored at 2-8 째C for up to 3 weeks. For long term storage (4-6 months), stock solutions should be stored at -20 째C. At 37 째 C in culture, ampicillin is stable up to 3 days.

==Usage Notes==
A 1990 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=2199796 paper] by [http://www.biology.bnl.gov/cellbio/studier.html Bill Studier] discusses how the secreted [[&beta;-lactamase]] can quickly consume all the ampicillin in a culture (even at 20&mu;g/ml Amp).  A stationary culture of ampicillin resistant cells can have such a concentration of [[&beta;-lactamase]] that even a 1/200 to 1/1000 dilution will still contain enough [[&beta;-lactamase]] to consume all the fresh ampicillin before all the non-resistant cells from the stationary phase culture have been killed.  The authors recommend not allowing cultures to reach stationary phase if you need a high proportion of cells to contain your plasmid.
*[[Barry Canton]] & [[Matt Gethers]] have seen this occur when using the BioBrick plasmid, pSB1A3 expressing a high level of mCherry.


[[Carbenicillin]] is much more resistant and would be preferred except for cost.  Mixtures of ampicillin and carbenicillin are often used.
