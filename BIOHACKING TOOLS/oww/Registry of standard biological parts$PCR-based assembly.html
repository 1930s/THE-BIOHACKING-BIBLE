*[http://elegans.bcgsc.bc.ca/worm_primer/wormprimer_info.html Automated PCR primer design for worm genes] - This is a good example of a simple CAD tool to encourage assembly.  You could imagine something similar to auto-generate the primers necessary for PCR-based assembly of standard parts.

==Demo==
Going to get a better feel for this by doing a few biobrick constructions using PCR-assembly
*[[Registry of standard biological parts/PCR-based assembly/Protocol]]

#<bbpart>J04500</bbpart>+<bbpart>I13501</bbpart> = <bbpart>J04450</bbpart> 
#<bbpart>R0010</bbpart>+<bbpart>I13504</bbpart> = <bbpart>J04430</bbpart> 

#<bbpart>F2620</bbpart>+<bbpart>P1010</bbpart>+<bbpart>E0240</bbpart>
#*will try this one as a 3-way

== UDG ==
Can use UDG (NEB USER enzyme) to replace all restriction digests and could also eliminate secondary PCRs also. You would just need to design your oligos to contain a U in the right location, assuming that there'll be a T somewhere in the vacinity of the ends of the parts you are trying to combine.

==In-Fusion==
*[http://www.clontech.com/products/detail.asp?product_id=162275&product_group_id=1433&product_family_id=1415&tabno=1 Clontech In-Fusion PCR cloning] -- this could be used for the last step so that we don't need to do a digest/ligation at any point in the process.
