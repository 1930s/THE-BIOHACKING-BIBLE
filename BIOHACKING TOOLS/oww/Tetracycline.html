==Mode of Action==
Tetracyclines (there are many) enter the cell by diffusion through OmpF porins.  It inhibits growth by preventing codon-anticodon interactions during translation.  

==Resistance Mechanism==
There are a number of resistance mechanisms, most require tetracycline antiporters.  The most commonly used is the tetA(C) gene.  The gene product of tetA(C) forms a pore in the inner membrane and exports one tet molecule for every proton imported.  [[Molecular Cloning]] states that tet resistance has a number of adverse affects on the cell, chief among those being a reduction in growth rate and viability. 

==Working concentration and Stock Solutions==
*Using a plasmid with copy number 15-20, 20&mu;g/ml tet has proved a successful selector.  The reduction in growth rate, described above was significant.
*The RajBhandary lab uses 5&mu;g/ml and see a minimal reduction in growth rate and never lose plasmid from their cells.
*Stock solution is 15 mg/ml in 50% ethanol.   Add 1 ml per liter of cooled broth or agar.  Solutions and plates are light sensitive.
*Tetracycline is incompatible with (chelated by) magnesium ions, and thus unsuitable for use in minimal media

==Counterselection techniques==
*Fusaric acid can be used to select against tetracycline resistant colonies.  See PMID 6259126, and modifications PMID 7007341.
*Nickel ions can also be used for tetR counterselection.  See PMID 8954882.
