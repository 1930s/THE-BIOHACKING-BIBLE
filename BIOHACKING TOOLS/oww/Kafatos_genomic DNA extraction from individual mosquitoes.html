== Genomic DNA extraction from individual mosquitoes ==

# Put 1 mosquito into an eppendorf tube with 100ul 50% w/v Chelex 100 in water. <BR>
# Squish fly with pestle and place at 100C for 10 minutes.<BR>
# Spin at top speed in a microfuge (>14,000xg) for 1 minute.<BR>
# Transfer 10ul supernatant to new tube and add 1ul Proteinase K (0.8 units).<BR>
# Incubate at 37C for 30min.<BR>
# Incubate at 100C for 5 min.<BR>
# Use 0.5ul as template in a 10ul PCR reaction.<BR>
