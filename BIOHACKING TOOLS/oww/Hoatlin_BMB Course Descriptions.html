;BCMB 605 Metals and Membranes Protein Journal Club 
:(1 credit) fall, winter, spring terms. Recent publications focused on biochemical and biophysical analysis of receptor-mediated signal transduction, ion-transport, and ligand-stimulated membrane protein trafficking will be discussed. In addition, this journal club will offer an overview of modern experimental approaches to the structure and function of membrane proteins, such as site-specific labeling, fluorescent spectroscopy, energy-transfer, EPR, and fluorescence photo bleaching recovery. Lutsenko.
;BCMB 605 Molecular Parasitiology Journal Club 
:(1 credit) fall, winter, spring terms – course offered bi-weekly. Papers to be discussed will include recent studies on parasites or parasitic diseases, with an emphasis on the biochemical and molecular biology aspect of the research, whether this be structure-function, host-parasite interaction or biophysical chemistry. Ullman.
;BCMB 605 (and CELL 605) Signal Transduction Journal Club 
:(1 credit) fall, winter, spring terms. Recent papers focusing on all aspects of signaling will be discussed, including but not limited to ligand-receptor interactions, receptor structure-function relationships, intracellular phosphorylation cascades, signal transmission into the nucleus, and gene regulation. The focus will be on linking biochemical and molecular mechanisms to physiological and pathological processes, including mechanisms of disease. Rotwein
