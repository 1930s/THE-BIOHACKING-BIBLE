==Notes==
*Anecdotal evidence suggests that you can obtain a higher yield by doing the first spin (of buffer PB1) at a reduced speed (~50% of max. on a typical tabletop centrifuge).  This gives the DNA more time to bind to the filter and hence reduces the amount of DNA that get washed through the filter.  Courtesy of [[User:Meaganl|Meagan Lizarazo]].
