Abstract

<p>A new method and device for the ratiometric measurement of oxygen concentration are presented. They are based
on the use of a dual-emission oxygen-sensitive dye. The method allows the exclusion of the influence of emission
overlap. The detection of the dual-emission ratio is performed using a single long-pass emission filter. The device
described is simpler than the widely used lifetime instruments and could easily be a stand-alone low-cost
instrument.</p>
