Ingrid Bijsmans was born in Heerlen, the Netherlands. She worked in the Hoatlin lab from September 2002 to May 2003 as part of earning her Bachelors degree from the Hogeschool van Utrecht. After her internship, she began a Masters Program in Oncology at the Vrije Universiteit (Free University) in Amsterdam, including another internship involving FA in the Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology. Ingrid started as a PhD student last August at the University of Maastricht studying the ovarian carcinogenic pathway. Her favorite memories from working in the Hoatlin lab include going out to exciting lunches like sushi and Thai and having Thanksgiving dinner at Maureen's house. Even though the turkey caught on fire, Ingrid said it still tasted great. She also enjoys snowboarding and would like to live in Oregon again soon.
