Let's make a new scent! Vanilla.

==Design the system==
We want a device that takes an input chemical and makes vanilla scent.  So we need enzymes that synthesize vanilla.

===Search the registry===
#Go to the Registry (http://parts.mit.edu)
#Use the search box to look for existing parts
#Search for vanilla ... you get no real hits ([http://www.google.com/search?domains=http%3A%2F%2Fparts.mit.edu&num=50&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&q=vanilla&btnG=Search&sitesearch=http%3A%2F%2Fparts.mit.edu])
#Search for vanillin ... ([http://www.google.com/search?domains=http%3A%2F%2Fparts.mit.edu&num=50&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&q=vanillin&btnG=Search&sitesearch=http%3A%2F%2Fparts.mit.edu])
#No one has made a vanilla synthesizing enzyme ... phew!

===Search the literature===
#Visit [http://pubmed.org PubMed]
#Search for vanilla 
#Find a [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=17437627&query_hl=1&itool=pubmed_docsum relevant paper]
#Go read the [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=17437627 paper]
#Identify the useful components described in the paper
#You seem to need two genes ''ech'' and ''fcs'' ... let's grab some sequence
#Search for Genbank accession numbers
#Follow the [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=nucleotide&dopt=GenBank&list_uids=40788116 Genbank link]

==Make a part==

===Enter a basic part===
#Go back to the [http://parts.mit.edu Registry]
#Login to the Registry 
#Click on the [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Add_a_Part_to_the_Registry '''Add a part''']
#Click on the [http://parts.mit.edu/r/parts/partsdb/add_part_b.cgi '''Add a basic part now''']
#*A basic part is a linear sequence of DNA with a fundamental function like a promoter, terminator, ribosome binding site, CDS etc.
#Choose Allow edits by your iGEM team
#Choose the next available part number, or some number within your team's allowed naming range.  
#Enter that number into the '''Selected Part Name''' field
#Choose a part type from the drop down menu. ('''Coding''')
#*Find out what the different part types are by clicking the [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part_Types '''Browse Part Types'''] link to the left.  The question marks next to each part type give a description of that part type.
#Enter a short description ... e.g. ''feruloyl-CoA hydratase for vanillin biosynthesis (ech)'' 
#Enter a long description of the part (you can update this more later)
#*Where species is the enzyme from? ''Pseudomonas fluorescens''
#*What reaction does it catalyze? ''One of two steps in the bioconversion of ferulic acid to vanillin.''
#*Does it work in ''E. coli''?  ''Yes.  The authors of the paper have shown that it works already.''
#*Does it require any other parts? ''Yes.  Both ech and fcs are needed for vanillin biosynthesis''
#Enter the source of this part
#*Include the species, the GenBank accession number and the paper reference
#Enter design considerations
#*The stop codon is TGA so we changed it to TAATAA to conform with BioBrick standards
#Click go on to enter the sequence and add feature annotations
#Return to the [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=nucleotide&dopt=GenBank&list_uids=40788116 Genbank entry]
#Click on the [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?val=40788116&from=1994&to=2824&view=gbwithparts '''cds'''] link to get the sequence of the coding region 
#Display it in FASTA format
#Copy the sequence
#Paste it into the sequence field and click '''Save''' in the upper right
#Change the TGA stop codon to TAATAA
#The Registry will automatically check your sequence for BioBricks restriction sites.
#*We will have to remove these in fabricating this part
#*Once the sites have been removed we can edit this information in the Registry
#*See [http://www.openwetware.org/wiki/Site-directed_mutagenesis OpenWetWare protocols on site directed mutagenesis]
#Click the '''Add a feature''' link
#Enter the start codon, stop codons and coding region as features.  Click '''Submit''' to save after entering each feature.  Add any other features that you think are important!

===Reviewing your part===
Now you can view the part you've created.

#Go to the [http://parts.mit.edu Registry]
#Click [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Type:iGEM_2007 '''Browse Parts by School''']
#Click on your school
#You should see the part in your sandbox

==Make a device==
Protein coding regions by themselves aren't very useful.  We need to make composite parts.

Let's make a protein generator to express our vanilla-scent making enzyme.

===Enter a composite part===
#Go back to the [http://parts.mit.edu Registry]
#Click on the [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Add_a_Part_to_the_Registry '''Add a part''']
#Click on the [http://parts.mit.edu/r/parts/partsdb/add_part_c.cgi '''Add a composite part now''']
#*A composite part is composed of two or more basic parts
#Choose Allow edits by your iGEM team
#Choose the next available part number, or some number within your team's allowed naming range.  
#Enter that number into the '''Selected Part Name''' field
#Choose a part type from the drop down menu. (''Generator'')
#*Find out what the different part types are by clicking the [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part_Types '''Browse Part Types'''] link to the left.  The question marks next to each part type give a description of that part type.
#Enter a short description ... e.g. ''feruloyl-CoA hydratase for vanillin biosynthesis protein generator''
#Enter a long description of the part (you can update this more later)
#*What does the device do? ''Helps to biosynthesize vanillin from ferulic acid''
#*What are the inputs and outputs to the device?  ''Takes in ferulic acid and produces vanillin.''
#*Are any other devices needed?  ''Also requires the other step of the biosynthesis pathway.''
#*Does the device have any chassis dependencies?
#Enter the source of this part
#*Reference the basic part.  You can easily link to any existing part on the wiki by typing <code><nowiki><partinfo>Part number</partinfo></nowiki></code>.
#Enter design considerations
#*''This device uses a strong constitutive promoter to generate a strong vanilla smell.''  or ''This device uses an inducible promoter to get a regulatable vanilla smell.''

Now we need to enter the subparts.  Here you enter the list of basic parts that make up the composite part.  Enter the part number of the enzyme you entered previously.  But you also need a promoter, RBS and terminator to construct a protein generator.

===Finding existing parts===
#In a new window, click [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part_Types '''Browse Part Types'''] on the navigation bar to the left.
#To express a gene, we need a promoter, RBS, and terminator.
#Browse the promoters by clicking [http://parts.mit.edu/r/parts/partsdb/pgroup.cgi?pgroup=Regulatory '''Regulatory''']
#Choose a promoter.  The green W indicates that the promoter has been shown to work. 
#Enter the part number into the subpart list.
#Return to browsing parts, choose an RBS and terminator as well.
#Enter these part numbers into the subpart list.
#You should now have 4 part numbers in the subparts field.
#Click '''Go on to enter other information about the part'''

==Constructing a part==
There are several option for constructing parts.  Meagan has already shown you how to obtain existing parts from the distribution.

To make new parts, you have 2 options
#Find the original genetic material and PCR the part.
#Order the part from a gene synthesis company.

To get help on how to make a part
#Click [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Help:Contents '''Help'''] on the navigation bar on the lefthandside of the page.
#Click on [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Help:Standardization '''Making BioBrick DNA''']
#Scroll to the bottom and click on [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Help:BioBrick_Prefix_and_Suffix '''Biobrick Prefix and Suffix can be found here''']

Or alternatively,
#Visit the [http://openwetware.org/wiki/BioBricks '''BioBricks'''] page on OpenWetWare
#And click on [http://openwetware.org/wiki/Synthetic_Biology:BioBricks/Part_fabrication '''Part fabrication''']

===Making your part by PCR===
#Design primers with the [http://openwetware.org/wiki/Synthetic_Biology:BioBricks/Part_fabrication#Quick_reference BioBrick prefix and suffix] on them in order to put the part into [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Help:An_Introduction_to_BioBricks BioBrick form].
#*Add the [http://openwetware.org/wiki/Synthetic_Biology:BioBricks/Part_fabrication#Prefix BioBricks prefix] to the 5' end of the upstream primer
#*Add the [http://openwetware.org/wiki/Synthetic_Biology:BioBricks/Part_fabrication#Suffix BioBricks suffix] to the 5' end of the downstream primer
#Clone it into a BioBricks plasmid.

===Making your part by direct synthesis===
Each team has 2kb of synthesis from GENEART for 25 cents a base.

Be sure and add the BioBrick prefix and suffix to your part!  You can codon optimize the part to improve its expression in certain species.  You can also remove restriction sites from the part.

==Construct a device==
First we should see if any parts of our system have already been made.

#Go to the [http://parts.mit.edu Registry]
#Click on [http://parts.mit.edu/r/parts/partsdb/search.cgi '''Part searches'''] on the navigation bar on the left
#Type your device part number in the '''Subpart Search''' field.
#Click '''Search'''.
#This will tell you whether any subparts of your system already exist.

Or alternatively, you can look for parts that contain your part of interest.
