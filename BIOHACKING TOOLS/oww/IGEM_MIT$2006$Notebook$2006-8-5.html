#take out colony PCR index plates (3 of them) '''done, in the fridge'''
#miniprep B0030+ATF1+B0015 and B0030+BSMT+B0015, and make glycerols '''done, in the freezer'''
#liquid culture transformants ['''done''' at 4:30PM, '''in the 37 deg room''', ask me (veena) if you have questions about what's what when you're miniprepping tomorrow, kate :)  note that three of the B0030.ATF1.B0015 tubes are actually B0032.ATF1.B0015 tubes, but I'm not sure which three those are because there were two plates labeled B0030.ATF1.B0015 and no plates labeled B0032.ATF1.B0015.]
