== About ==

I am a graduate student in John Willis' lab in the Department of Biology at Duke University.  Before coming to Duke, I obtained my M.S. from the Botany (now Plant Biology) Department at North Carolina State University.  I also completed my undergraduate degrees in botany and horticultural science at NC State, and spent some of my time while I was an undergraduate in the lab of Michael Purugganan.

== Research Interests ==

Broadly, I am interested in evolutionary genetics, and currently, I am interested in how polyploidy interacts with the process of evolution.  More specifically, I am interested in questions such as:

*Why is polyploidy more prevalent in some lineages but not others? 

*How do organisms vary in their response to genome doubling, and does this variation reflect an adaptive response?

*How does polyploidy contribute to the origin of reproductive isolating barriers among polyploid lineages?
