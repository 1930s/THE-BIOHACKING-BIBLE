==Streptavidin Depletion Assay: c5.0.Fb (inside biotinylated barrel)==
===Plans===
* Since the Fb used in the assay last night was the only barrel not folded yesterday, and because all the barrels folded at the same time as Fb (ie. [[IGEM:Harvard/2006/DNA_nanostructures/Notebook/2006-8-22#Gel|8.22.06]]) [[IGEM:Harvard/2006/DNA_nanostructures/Notebook/2006-8-22#Gel|looked somewhat misfolded]], it's possible that something went wrong during that folding. 
** Thus, before remaking a large number of pre-working and working stocks and possibly thus wasting materials, I'll first refold using remade Fb (from [[IGEM:Harvard/2006/DNA_nanostructures/Notebook/2006-8-23#Folded:|yesterday]]) and retry the assay using just it and c5.0.A.

===Folded===
* 2 rxns of Fb at 30mM MgCl2, using Fb made [[IGEM:Harvard/2006/DNA_nanostructures/Notebook/2006-8-23#Folded:|yesterday].

* (Additionally, folded for Katie 5 rxns each of:
**c5.0.A (lidless)
**c5.0.C (core)
**c5.0.D (core))
