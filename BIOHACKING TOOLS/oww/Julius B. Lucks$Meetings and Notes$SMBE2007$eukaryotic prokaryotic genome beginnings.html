* Metazoan Diversification: Fossil Record
* evol in animals prolonged historical event
** 1st sponge biomarkers 635 mya
* increase in num taxa - 2 stages
* book - Wonderful Life (Steven Jay Gould - 1989)
** diff between taxonomic divers and disparity (morphological diver)
** major radiation of morpho forms in Cambrian followed by winnowing
* constrained diversification
** rapid increases in morpho disparity

* tracing characteris through tree/net of life
** Darwin's coral of life, coalescence, radiation, Adam and Eve
** coral of life since the core is dead
* Origin of the Primary Plastids
** Chlamidya - a third partner?
* Cenancestor - last universal common ancestor (LUCA)
** at the point of its existence, many organisms living at same time - long time away from origin of life
* Coalescence - process of tracing lineages backwards in time to their common ancest. Every 2 extant leniages coalesce to most recent common ances.  Even all lineages coalesce to cenancestor
* Y chromosome Adam - lived 50,000 years ago - Thomson PNAS 2000, 97, 7280
* Mitochondrial Eve - 166,000-249,000 years ago - Cann, R. L., 1987, Nature, 326, 31
** adam and eve never met
** same is true for ancestral rRNAs, EF, SRP, ATPases

Tue Jun 26 10:00:02 EDT 2007
* very good speaker

== Words to Look Up ==
* mevalonate pathway

== Talk ==
* bioinformatics
** work in the present - decide differences between groups
** clustering algorithms, PCA - 4 major groups
* phylogenomics
** going from starting 4 groups (present) to topological relationships that get to the past
** 27 diff sorts of patterns
** starting point is unrooted trees
*** how can we root these
* gene transfer
** imposes limitations or rooting the tree
** rampant, but not random
** informational genes
*** DNA to protein genes
*** came to eukaryotes from achaebacterio
** operational genes
*** household work - AA, lipid biosynthesis, etc.
*** come to eukaryotes from eubacteria
* M. Embly, W. Martin, Nature - News and Views
** diff views on tree of life
** Doolittle - gene transfer so extensive, can't know how groups form
** another idea - eukaryotes so diff from prokaryotes - group into 2 classes and move on
** ring of life - fusion of archea and bacteria to form 1st eukaryote
*** genome sequences - now can look at absences and presences
**** many ways that an absence abscence can appear
**** conditioned reconstruction - take a 3rd genome (conditioning) to identify presences - only analyze these
*** parsimony-like analysis that roots the tree
**** if fusion event, must have been present in same space-time point
**** everything after this fusion is later in the tree of life

=== Prokarytic Evol becomes pop driven sim to Euk evol ===
* find groups that minimize gene exchange between groups
* 4 groups
** actinobacteria - diverse clade including many pathogens like Mycobacterium TB
** archea
** firmicutes (gram positive) - bacillus (anthrax)
** double membrane prokaryotes
* directed indels to make these determinations
** same technique as rooting tree of life with sequences
** parsimony arguments - see where changes ocurred wrt conditioning group - where changes occurred cannot be part of the group
** root of TOL not within archaebacteria and eubacteria

=== Ubiquitous genes not needed for indel rooting ===
* top-down rooting analyzes both indel presence and absence and gene p and a
** can analyze incomplete gene sets
** root not within double-membrane prokaryotes
* beta-alpha-8 barrels (Tim Barrels)
** structural motif characterized by 8 beta sheets in center, 8 alpha helices on outside
** alpha-6: region between this and beta sheet - indel
** 'PyrD' - pyrimidine biosynthesis - housekeeping gene
