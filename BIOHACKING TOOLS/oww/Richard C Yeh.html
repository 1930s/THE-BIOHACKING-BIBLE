From 2005 to 2006, at [http://www.nstec.com/ National Security Technologies (then Bechtel Nevada)] in Los Alamos, NM, I did project management, systems engineering, LabVIEW programming, and experimental measurement of noise and distortion for streak cameras used in VISAR.  
In 2004, at [http://www.nationalacademies.org the National Academies in Washington, DC], I did background research for an NSF-funded study on advanced research instrumentation funding policy.  
From 2002 to 2004, at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, I did [http://hdl.handle.net/1813/3576 dissertation] research on mixing and microarray hybridization efficiency with Professor Carl Franck.  
From 1999 to 2002, at Cornell, I did [http://hdl.handle.net/1813/3611 thesis] research on single-molecule biophysics with Professor Michelle Wang.  
From 1993 to 1998, at Caltech in Pasadena, CA, I majored in physics.
In the summer of 1997, at [http://www.polytechnique.fr/ the Ecole Polytechnique in Palaiseau, France], I did superconductor magnetic susceptibility experiments with Dr. Marcin Konczykowski and Dr. C. J. van der Beek.
In the summers of 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1998, at Rockwell Science Center and Rockwell Semiconductor Systems, I assisted in high-speed circuits development.
