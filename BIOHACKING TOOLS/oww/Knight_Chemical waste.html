==Disposal==
Chemical waste containers need to be stored in secondary containers (the gray bins labeled with satellite accumulation area stickers).  Incompatible chemicals cannot be stored in the same secondary container.

Red hazardous waste tags are stored in the filing cabinet outside 32-322.  When they run low, request more when you submit a chemical waste pickup request at the form linked below.

==Pickup==
[http://web.mit.edu/environment/ehs/chem_collection.html Chemical waste collection form] - fill out this form to request a chemical waste pickup.  Be sure and give them directions to the lab as well (put this link [http://openwetware.mit.edu/wiki/Knight:Contact#Directions http://openwetware.mit.edu/wiki/Knight:Contact#Directions] in the comments field).  Note: request a pickup just before the waste container becomes full.
