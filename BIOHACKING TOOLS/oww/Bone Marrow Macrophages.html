==Overview==

Preparation of bone marraow macrophages from mice.

==Materials==
*[[BM20]]
*[[BM10]]
*PBS/EDTA

==Procedure==
'''Day 0'''
#Dissect out mouse femurs and tibias (total of four bones per mouse).
#Flush the bone marrow from each bone with 5-10 cc of BM20 using a syringe and a 26G needle. Combine the bone marrow from a single mouse into a 50-mL conical tube. Vortex briefly, and bring total volume to 50mL.
#Plate cells into non-TC treated 10-cm petri dishes (Fisherbrand Cat #08-757-12), 10mL per Petri dish, 5 Petri dishes/mouse 
#Incubate at 37°C/5% CO2.				

'''Day 4'''
#Add 8-10 mL BM20/ petri dish. Be careful not to slosh the cells at this stage since 20mL BM20 per Petri dish will be quite full.

'''Day 7'''
#Remove media, add 5 mL cold 0.02% EDTA in PBS (Sigma E8008).  Incubate at 4°C for 10 min, then use a cell scraper to remove the cells from the plastic.
#Transfer cells to a 50-mL conical, spin (1k rpm, 10 min), and resuspend in BM10 for counting.
#Plate the cells in BM10 (generally 1.5 x 105 cells/ well in a 24 well-plate).  Allow cells to rest for 3 days.

'''Day10'''
#Cells are now considered “rested” and ready for use.

==Notes==
*Primary macrophages don’t come off TC-treated plastic.
