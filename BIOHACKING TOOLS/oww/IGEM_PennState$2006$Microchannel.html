== Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) Prep ==

*1.  Add 10g PDMS and 1g curing agent to a weigh boat
*2.  Stir vigorously for 3 to 5 minutes (the mixture should be opaque from trapped gas bubbles)
*3.  Allow the mixture to set for 20-30 minutes or until all bubbles are gone


== Spin Coating ==

*1.  Prepare PDMS as shown above no more than 1 hour before you're ready to spin coat
*2.  Attach the selected mold to the spin coating machine
*3.  Pour PDMS slowly and evenly over the entire mold
*4.  Spin the mold for 30 seconds at 500rpm
*5.  Carefully remove the coated mold from the spin coating machine and place it a leveled oven to cure for 2 hours at 75C
*6.  Using a razor, cut out the desired pieces of the micro channel array and place them in a Petri dish (make sure to note the orientation of the channels for storage)


== PDMS Surface Treatment via O2 Plasma ==

*1.  Place the PDMS channels "face up" on the O2 Plasma device platform
*2.  Run the coating procedure for 1 minute
*3.  Immediately transfer the treated channels to agar media (treated micro channels should be face down to maintain their hydrophilic state)''
