==Reported problems==

===Shaking incubator===
The display on the top (37 degree) shaking incubator is dead. The incubator seems to work fine, but you can't see/change the settings.-[[User:Jkm|Jkm]] 18:37, 13 September 2006 (EDT)

==Fixed==
===Quanta===
While the quanta was on but sitting idle, a large spark erupted from the inner left wall followed by a spewing stream of foul-smelling smoke. The machine was promptly shut down. Scott Sepulveda has been contacted, and I am currently waiting for his return call. -[[User:Cbeisel|Cbeisel]] 13:21, 24 August 2006 (EDT)

The wonderful folks at Beckman Coulter have diagnosed the problem -- a failed filter capacitor -- and will replace the entire circuit board today or Monday. Although the tech felt that the quanta should work without the capacitor, the electrical settings are now completely skewed. Basically, leave it alone until the circuit board is replaced. -[[User:Cbeisel|Cbeisel]] 10:15, 25 August 2006 (EDT)

Quanta has been fixed. -[[User:Jkm|Jkm]]

===Thermocycler===
"Uniformity failure. Service Alpha soon."

Not clear what this means in terms of performance.

Thermocycler was sent off for repair on 8/8/06. -[[User:smolke|CDS]]

Received 8/22/06. Power cord delivered 8/24/06, everything seems to work. -[[User:Jkm|Jkm]]

===Centrifuge===
Set off to be fixed.

Received 8/18.

===Autoclave===
Gravity cycle completed successfully. The autoclave should be fine -- until something else breaks anyway. [[User:Cbeisel|Cbeisel]] 16:59, 15 August 2006 (EDT)

Autoclave should be fixed - I'll try a cycle this afternoon.  [[User:Tsbayer|Tsbayer]] 15:14, 15 August 2006 (EDT)

A fuse was blown in a recently discovered box (above the -80 freezer at the ceiling).  Electrician replaced it.

===UV table===
Fixed, 8/7/06, -[[User:Jkm|Jkm]]

The imager has six UV bulbs (Ushio G8T5E). If one bulb burns out or comes loose, the pair stops working. Replacements are in a drawer on the opposite side of the bay. Currently all six are working, and we have one spare.

===Electroporator===
Fixed, 7/31/06

The lid of the electroporator is broken. A new one is on order. Hold the lid closed while pulsing.

We've seen software bugs since the lid broke - either the software kicks back to the main screen when you try to pulse, or the screen freezes at 'pulsing'. It doesn't seem that the machine actually pulsed when this happens.
