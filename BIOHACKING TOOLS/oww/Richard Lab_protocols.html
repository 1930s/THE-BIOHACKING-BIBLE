====Method used to measure and analyze gas fluxes from a given surface====
*gaseous emission data is collected using a [http://www.abe.psu.edu/bioconversion/gas_sampling.ppt static flux chamber and a photoacoustic sensor]. 
*an [http://www.abe.psu.edu/bioconversion/programPAS.xls Excel program] is then used to extract relevant data (from the continuous data collected by the photoacoustic sensor every minute). The same program also calculates the flux of selected gases from the tested surface, using Pedersen's equation (2001). 
*selected data are copied and pasted as values into a compiled data set
*a regression analysis is performed to evaluate the effect of time, biofilter treatment, and other input variables on the flux level of each analyzed gas: ammonia, methane, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and water vapor. The Sagata Regression Pro software (ltd) is used: go to regression > pick inputs > pick outputs > chose data types (categorical or continuous) > chose regression model (to evaluate interactions create input variables made of factors evaluate for interaction amongst them, multiplied by each other) > go to output, get response vs. factors for preliminary graphs > choose indicative title for the output sheet > click ok.
*the statistical analysis output is interpreted: the first Anova table shows possible treatment effect. The "term significance" table shows effect of individual factors (or interactions).  

====Method used to measure BOD, moisture and VS content ====
Organic matter samples are analyzed according to the following instructions for [http://www.abe.psu.edu/bioconversion/biofilter_characterization/BOD.htm BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand)] and [http://www.abe.psu.edu/bioconversion/biofilter_characterization/moisture_and_VS.htm moisture and Volatile Solids (organic matter) content] analysis. 

====Method used to reconfigure data from a data logger, into a format compatible with our data analysis methods====
The following is a set of [http://www.abe.psu.edu/bioconversion/temperature/instructions.htm instructions on how to use macros] to transform a data set from [http://www.abe.psu.edu/bioconversion/temperature/config1.htm configuration 1] to [http://www.abe.psu.edu/bioconversion/temperature/config2.htm configuration 2].
