==Hardware/Site domain==
#Hardware: Need plan to move to new hardware and server configuration w/in 12 months.  
#*Jay Copeland suggests having a backup machine that's synch'd every night and that is ready to go online in a snap (i.e., DNS worked out ahead of time).  Also need to protect the building against "slashdoting" and so on (i.e., need a hosting site that will keep OWW from becoming a DNS focal point for building 68).  These points are serious enough that they need to be resolved ASAP.
#Hardware Support: Need plan to support hardware and software.
#*Should involve some basic IT support, and support for a development environment.  Even something as simple as updating the MediaWiki software requires that somebody back-check that our existing OWW extensions work.

*Comments to Ponder:
In five years, Mac OS XIV will likely have iWiki(TM) software pre-installed on every machine, et cetera.  How does the impact what we need to do?
