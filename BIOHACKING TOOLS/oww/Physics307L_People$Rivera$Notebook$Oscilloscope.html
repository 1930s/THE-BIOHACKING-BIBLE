==Oscilloscope Lab Summary==
# Brief summary of what you did (linking to the lab manual page is OK) [http://openwetware.org/wiki/Antonio_C._Rivera_Lab_book/070827# Lab]
# Add links to all wiki pages that contain your notebook entries.  This is likely only one page. [http://openwetware.org/wiki/Antonio_C._Rivera_Lab_book/070827# Lab]
# Report your value for the fall time using AC coupling.
 ''fall time = 57.48ms''
* Include error bars!
{{Side comment|comment=[[User:Steven J. Koch|Steven J. Koch]] 14:33, 28 August 2007 (EDT):I agree: taking multiple measurements and then using Excel or something to compute the mean and standard error of the mean would be a good way to include error bars.  If this were a "real lab," I would not accept the answer without error bars, so you would have to find a way to take more data!}}
 ''should have taken multiple measurements over time the used mean square for value 
 and std deviation for error''
* Explain how you measured this (briefly) 
 ''This was measured by using the oscilloscope's measurement and selecting "fall time"''  
# What did you learn?
{{Side comment|comment=[[User:Steven J. Koch|Steven J. Koch]] 14:36, 28 August 2007 (EDT):I am glad you learned a lot, and that will be great if you can play around with a scope at work.  I completely agree that I should have left more time for creative work--I apologize for misjudging how long the exercise would take!<br><br>I will send you an email with your grade for this lab.}}
* It's OK if you didn't learn anything.  But include things you are still confusing.
 ''I learned a lot about how to read the scope and to make measurements using the tools on the scope.
 I think it will help when I am doing labs and have to use it to measure data. I have used a
 multi-meter extensively at work but not an oscilloscope. I am still not full sure how I might use
 it for measuring values from the actual labs, but think that this will come as the 
 lab progresses.''
# What did you explore outside of the standard lab procedure?  Anything interesting?
 ''Didn't have time to do more would like to have more time to play. 
 I may pull one out at work and play around a bit when I get time.''
# What could make the lab better next year?
 ''shorten to leave more time for play.''
