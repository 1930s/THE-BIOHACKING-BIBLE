==Protocol for Vesicle Formation==

===Day 1===

====Equipment====
*Nitrogen tap + plastic tubing
*Desiccator connected to a vacuum
*100ml glass bottle
*Sonicator with medium-sized probe
*Ice bath
*25°C incubator
*Pipette + pipette tips (1000µl)

====Reagents====
* 10ml dodecane
* 12.5µl 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) 20mg/ml in chloroform, ≥99.0%

====Procedure====

'''Preparing the lipid-oil suspension for the inner leaflet'''
#Place 125µl of the 20mg/ml DOPC solution in a 100ml glass bottle.
#With the plastic tubing and 1ml pipette tip, evaporate the chloroform under nitrogen to obtain a dry, thin lipid film.
#Put the bottle in a desiccator connected to a vacuum for 1h.
#Add 50ml of mineral oil to reach a final lipid concentration of 0.05mg/ml.
#Set the sonicator probe to pulse 1, timer at 30mins.
#Put the bottle containing the suspension in the ice bath.
#Secure the sonicator probe inside the bottle, and set the amplitude to a reading of 10 when it is sonicating.
#Sonicate the suspension for 30mins.
#Leave overnight at 25°C to ensure that the lipid molecules are fully dispersed in oil.

===Day 2===

====Equipment====
*Magnetic stirrer
*Centrifuge + 1-inch glass centrifuge tubes
*Pipette + pipette tips (200µl, 1000µl)
*50ml glass tube
*5ml syringe
*Long 16-gauge stainless steel needle

====Reagents====
*10ml ddH2O
*Tris buffer
*NaCl
*Reporter

====Procedure====

'''Emulsifying the aqueous solution''' (while the interface settles)
#Separate about 5ml of the lipid-oil suspension into a glass container. '''This is for the interface preparation.'''
#Prepare a 10ml solution A with 100mM NaCl and 5 mM Tris buffer at pH 7.4.
#Prepare solution B by adding a suitable quantity of reporter to 1ml of solution A.
#Add 250µl of solution B to the 45ml lipid-oil suspension in mineral oil.
#Gently stir the mixture with a magnetic stir bar for 3h.

'''Preparing the interface''' (to be done while the emulsion is mixing)
#Place 2ml of lipid-oil suspension over 3ml of solution A in a 1-inch-diameter centrifuge tube. 
#Leave for 2–3h for lipids to achieve the coverage of the interface surface.

'''Forming the vesicles'''
#Pour 100µl of the inverted emulsion over the interface.
#Centrifuge at 120g for 10min.

'''Collecting the vesicles'''
#Using a 5ml syringe with a long 16-gauge stainless steel needle, collect some of solution A.
#Expel some of the solution to remove all air from the syringe and needle.
#With the tip of the needle in the aqueous phase, gently expel the solution contained in the syringe.
#Gently recirculate the buffer several times.
#Aspirate most of the solution into the syringe, and remove the needle from the solution.
#Wipe the tip of the needle clean.
#Unload the vesicle suspension into its final container.

''(Note: Use optical microscopy to check that the vesicles obtained arenot deformed or aggregated.)''

===Notes===
*Time Required:
**The lipid-oil suspension preparation takes about 2h (with a 1h waiting period 15min into the procedure), before being left overnight.
*The remainder of the procedure takes another 4h, with one 2h waiting period after an initial 1h preparation.
**Total working time in the lab is around 3 hours.
* The original protocol uses anhydrous 99:1 dodecane:silicone oil solution instead of mineral oil.
*The original protocol uses POPC instead of DOPC phospholipids.
*The original protocol sonicates the suspension in a cleaning sonic bath for 30min.
*Do not use rubber tubing in the nitrogen evaporation. '''This emits debris into the lipids.'''
*This procedure should form around 10^9 vesicles with 1µm diameter.
*Use of salt in the solution A preparation may require osmolarity considerations.
*Use of GFP as a visual signal may require osmolarity considerations.
*The reporter in solution B is optional. '''The vesicles may be visible without it.'''
*The interface should settle for more than 2h, but less than 3h. '''More than 3h causes the lipids to clump.'''
