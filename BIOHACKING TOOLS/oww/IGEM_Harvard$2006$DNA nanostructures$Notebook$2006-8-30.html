==Streptavidin Magnetic Bead Depletion Assay==
* Biotinylated oligos still haven't come in yet, but the necessary accompanying "split" oligos (ie. the c5.0.#r'''b''' oligos) without biotinylation ''did'' come in.
* Reconstituted them to 200uM and put in c5.0 rack.

**(Previous biotinylated oligo tube orders from Invitrogen have been at ~200nmole amounts, but that has been greatly in excess of what has been actually needed and used.  Thus this order was made with ~50nmole amounts, which will explain the relatively smaller amount of liquid in each tube, in case anyone is concerned about this at a later date.)
