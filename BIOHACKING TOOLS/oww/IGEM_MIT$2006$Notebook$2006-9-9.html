#check sequences (dye blob re-runs should be in from 9/1 order) - '''done (KB)'''
#pellet new yeast cells: bake with 1 pellet and resuspend 2nd in milk - '''done (KB)'''
#glycerol any of the LCs in fridge that look good post this second sequence analysis (299A, 319ABC are good) - '''done (KB)'''
#*discard of confirmed bad dna and glycerols! - '''done (KB)'''
#glycerol 3 additional LCs of the 399-1s and glycerol y0078/y0080- '''done (KB)'''
#make LCs from sketchy 400 plates: (1 colonies: ligation 3, 5 colonies: ligation 4, other plates seem to be too contaminated and overgrown) - '''done (SP)'''
#Y0080 and Y0078 yeast vectors - '''done (SP)'''
#*miniprep
