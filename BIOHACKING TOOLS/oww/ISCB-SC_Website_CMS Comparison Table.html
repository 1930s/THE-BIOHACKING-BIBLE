== About this document ==

This document is an appendix of [[ISCB-SC:Website]].

WCT team members, please add functional and non-functional requirements from [[ISCB-SC:Website:Requirements]] to the comparison table.

We could make a judged decision on CMS software then.


WCT team members responsible for CMS comparison:

* [[User:Neksa|Alexander]]
* Thomas
* Abhishek
* (add your name here)

== Trial/Evaluation installations ==

Playgrounds:

* [http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/sandbox/thabe/sc/ Drupal] (maintained by Thomas)
* [http://iscbsc.neksa.net/ Joomla 1.5] (maintained by [[User:Neksa|Alexander]])

Should we have minimum requirements for the playgrounds? As a basis to test?
* a forum that uses the same login credential as the login for the web site
* some basic content, copied from the current iscb site to play with
* 4 groups of users:
** anonymous, can only read content
** authenticated, can post in the forum
** sc-leader, can add and edit content on the main site
** admin, can modify all content of the site, can change the layout of the site.

== Discussion ==

Other week/strong points not included into the comparison table should be '''discussed here'''.


: ('''+Joomla''') Joomla 1.5 is the choice of ISCB for the new ISCB portal. With the integration and possible portal merging in the future, I find it a very strong point --[[User:Neksa|Alexander]]
:: As you stated on the other pages, merging is not straighforward, even when using the same sofware. Using the same software does not ease the transition, so I do not agree that the ISCB's choice is a strong point. I think we should find out '''why''' ISCB picked Joomla. Maybe those reasons are a strong point, but the choice on its own says very little. --[[User:Thomas Abeel|Thomas Abeel]]


: ('''+Joomla''') [http://www.joomla-portal.com/home/45-Joomla-2006-Open-Source-CMS-Award-Winner Joomla! 2006 Open Source CMS Award Winner] --[[User:Neksa|Alexander]]
:: ('''~Joomla''') ('''~Drupal''') This should really be place in perspective. From the website of the company that gave the award: "The final result, as voted for by judges from The Open Source Collective, MySQL, the Eclipse Foundation, and 16,000 users on www.PacktPub.com saw a tie for first place between Joomla! and Drupal. In the event of a tie, a fourth independent judge would be brought in. This was Apoorv Durga who is a member of CM Pros and runs his own blog [http://apoorv.info/] on portals and content management. This crucial vote ended up with Joomla! triumphing over Drupal by one point." From that I gather that the margin is actually quite small and that we should look at what functionality we need and which CMS offers those features. --[[User:Thomas Abeel|Thomas Abeel]] 
::: I should also mention that 2006 was so far the only year the award was given and the voting process is not transparant. And the company (it is a company, not some big organization) that gave the award is a recently (2004) started publishing company. For the 2007 award, the finalists are Elgg, Drupal, Moodle, LifeType and Wordpress, but Joomla is nowhere to be seen this year.

: ('''-Joomla''') ('''+Drupal''') Have a look at some other overviews of the strenghts and weaknesses of both Joomla and Drupal. [http://forum.joomla.org/index.php?topic=4364.msg35306] [http://forums.digitalpoint.com/showpost.php?p=251737&postcount=8] Using the current list of requirement we really need Drupal for the fine-grained access right alone. --[[User:Thomas Abeel|Thomas Abeel]]
