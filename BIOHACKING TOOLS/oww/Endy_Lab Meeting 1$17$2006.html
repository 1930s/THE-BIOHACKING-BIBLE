#Vectors ([[Reshma Shetty |RS]], 5mins)
##Naming conventions
##*The '''-1''' naming convention to represent the presence of the ccd operon in the multiple cloning site of BioBricks plasmids has been changed.  The ccd operon is now a part (BBa_P1010).  So vectors are named for instance '''pSB1AK3-P1010''' rather than '''pSB1AK3-1'''.  (Change was requested by Sri and Austin and implemented by Randy in the Registry.)
##Representation
##*Vectors are now represented in the Registry as a piece of DNA from BioBricks suffix to BioBricks prefix so that they can be easily viewed as a linear piece of DNA.
##How would something like the screening plasmid be specified in the registry? [[Josh Michener|JM]]
##*e.g. it has a BB site within a device, seems like it could be considered a plasmid? maybe pSB1A3-I13534?
