<h1>September 3, 2007</h1>
*Ran gel on PCR products
*PCR purified the 2 PCR rxns which worked:
**0.01uL crp* template Pfu Polymerase
**1.0uL crp* template Phusion Polymerase
*Restricted the 2 PCR purified samples along with P1010 in psB1A2
**Cut with E+S, 20uL digests
*Ran gel on restrictions to extract psB1A2 and confirm that I still have crp*

*Ran out of TAE buffer and Tien's lab is closed and locked. Will get more TAE and re-restrict tomorrow or wednesday.
