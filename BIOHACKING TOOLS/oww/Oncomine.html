This presentation from the Bio[[MIBLab]] [[Summer 2006 Workshop]] is a [[Summer 2006 Workshop#Databases|database]] bioinformatics tool.

==Synopsis==
A unifying bioinformatic resource of analyzed cancer transcriptome data. 

==Features==
*Web based program
*Meta analysis between different experiments 
*Easy to use interface across the spectrum of researchers
*Bridges the gap between clinicians 
:can use when tumor samples are low due to wide variety of samples on the database
*High level analysis
*All analyzed data standardized
*Co-Expression Analysis
:Identifies genes that are similarly expressed across several tissue samples within various experiments
*Only includes cancer specific data
*Must go through external sites for raw data, therefore raw data is not in a standardized format.
*Need login access (free for academic not free for civilians)
*The link to the databases does not take you directly to the page for the specific gene. The user must search the database themselves.
