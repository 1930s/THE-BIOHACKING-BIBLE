==CALIBRATION==

We used Mercury to calibrate** Tomas helped me understand why exactly why calibration was important. It was easier to realize what was going on once we put all the numbers in Excel.
  
We measured the wavelength with the cross hairs as close to the center of the slit as possible rotating the knob clockwise.

With help from Excel, the calibration curve gives.

Data Analysis

Linefit says the calibration data fits the line <math>actual\,wavelength=(1.204205 \pm 0.042636)*measured\,wavelength-(76.833959 \pm 22.932003)nm</math>.
