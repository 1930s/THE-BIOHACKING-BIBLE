==Registry==

*<bbpart>BBa_T9002</bbpart>
:[[image:T9002.JPG]]

==Design choices==
*This part is already available in the Registry
*It has the following properties that we need in order to characterize the Prey Sensing Part: 
**The part responds to AHL levels, via activation of pLuxR
**From this, we can calibrate a AHL assay based on fluorescence
**LuxR is under the control of pTet, allowing different levels of LuxR to be achieved

*AHL Levels: 
**The model is sensitive to initial AHL levels
**As AHL input increase, GFP output increases until saturation
**The relationship between AHL level and GFP output is described by the equation above
**The exact relationship can be calculated from this assay

==Open issues==
A potential issue with the experiment is regarding using pTet as the promoter for LuxR expression. It may be necessary to add a gene for TetR expression to ensure control over this promoter.
