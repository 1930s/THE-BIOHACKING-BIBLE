==Ion channels==
* Two state gate model
** compare with Hodgkin-Huxley model
** Only one time constant (simple exponential) in two state model
** Can't explain inactivation
* Use 4 gates, 3 activating, 1 inactivating
** All independent
** channel is open iff all gates open
** Pr[channel open] = Pr[gate1 open]*Pr[gate2 open]*Pr[gate3 open]*Pr[gate4 open] = <math>m^3h</math>
** <math>G_{Na} = N\gamma m^3h</math>, <math>\overline{G_{Na}}=N\gamma</math>
** Exactly Hodgkin-Huxley!
* Activation is independent of inactivation
** Also pharmacologically independent
** Pronase only inhibits inactivation of sodium channel
* What HH model cannot explain
** Tail currents
** Current that occurs at end of step should be 3 times faster than <math>\tau_m</math> but the actual data doesn't agree
