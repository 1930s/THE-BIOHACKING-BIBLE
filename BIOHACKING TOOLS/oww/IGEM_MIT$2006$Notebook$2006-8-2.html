#analyze 42 sequence results using prepared contigs in VectorNTI -'''done. unfortunately our analysis shows that nothing seems to have inserted. Perhaps digests are not being run long enough? also, pchBA mutagenesis was unsuccessful.
#start isoamyl alcohol generating device work
#*PCR BAT2 and THI3 again to get higher DNA concentrations for digesting/ligating on 8/3 -'''done'''
#(3 pm) meeting with advisors -'''done'''
#run gel of PCR products/PCR cleanup and nanodrop BAT2 and THI3
#colony PCRs -'''done'''
#make liquid cultures from each potentially useful transformant plate and glycerol stocks for assembly on 8/3

==meeting topics==
#troubleshoot pchBA primers
#troubleshoot pchBA mutagenesis
#troubleshoot digests/failed assemblies
#timeline of assembly work (best case scenario)

==liquid cultures from potentially useful plates==
#7/31 plates: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
#*4/5/6/7 = maybe ATF1mut-Term ('''colony PCR to check first''')
#*8 = maybe ROO40-E0840
#8/1 plates: 7, 8, 9
#*7/8/9 = maybe ATF1mut-Term ('''colony PCR to check first''')

==liquid cultures from glycerols for assembly 8/3==

==primers==
#design/order THI3 mutagenesis primers
#order new (add 2 more annealing bases) pchA reverse primer

==team meeting: assembly plan==
#current status of parts:
#*WGGD: BSMT+Terminator
#*SAGD: still trying to PCR pchBA
#*BSGD: (?) ATF1mut+Term (?)
#*IAGD: PCRed both coding regions
#*osmY: pcr product
