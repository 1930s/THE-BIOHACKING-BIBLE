== Abstract ==
After the completion of the sequencing of human genome, and the subsequent near-complete sequencing of various genomes made various 'genome-wide' approaches possible. In particular, microarray technologies and alternative ways to measure the transcriptome are proving as useful tools in dissecting the precise mechanisms of the (patho)physiology of organisms. After a brief review on a recent paper utilizing such technologies, a detailed example on data analysis of Affymetrix platform chip will be given.
