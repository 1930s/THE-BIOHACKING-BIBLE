My research is aimed at understanding the structural basis of RNA 
folding and stability. In the last decade, major advancements have been 
made in the field of RNA crystallography, paving the way for 
atomic-level understanding of what drives the folding of biologically 
relevant RNAs. We use a wide variety of biophysical and biochemical 
techniques to create models of RNA folding intermediates. Our most 
recent work has involved electron cryomicroscopy and single particle 
reconstruction to directly image the catalytic and specificity domains 
of RNase P RNA.
