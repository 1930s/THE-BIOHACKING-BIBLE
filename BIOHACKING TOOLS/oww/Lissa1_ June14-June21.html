# Grow up a culture of pGEV.
# SUMO
## Pour gel
### Fill stacking up to top
### Insert comb at angle
### If at first it doesn't succeed...
### More TEMED in running?
## Run gel
### Voltage = 500 (Note: load sample in center wells to mitigate smiling)
### Will it make a difference if we refresh buffer over time?
# Gal4 question?

==Thursday, June 15==
# Miniprep of pGEV
# Digest of pGEV.
## enzyme SnaBi?
# Overnight of yeast.
# Make plates?
# Check on SUMO gel?

==Friday, June 16==
# Yeast-pGEV Transformation
# Start Western. Overnight incubation w. antibody.

==Weekend, June 17-18==
# Saturday
## Wash and image.

==Monday, June 19==
# Take out transformations - NOTHING IS GROWING.  BOOHOO.
# Grow up overnight culture - morning
# pour new sumo gel at 10% - afternoon
# digest pGEV - morning
# Sequence pGEV to see if it's what we thought it was - whenever server is up
# figure out how to get gradient gel for future Westerns - afternoon
# analyze ImageQuant data from Saturday's Western - afternoon

# use VectorNTI to make a model of pGEV - afternoon

==Tuesday, June 20==
# Re-do transformation the old way- no go.  Overnight culture didn't grow.  Streaked a new plate of 1030-1018 yeast to try again.
# do transformation with Alex's EZ kit - also couldn't do.
# start new sumo @400 V

==Wednesday, June 21==
# hope new sumo finishes - not done in AM.  Made new cathode buffer and replaced all buffers.
#Do gel to see if PCR picked up an DNA


==Thursday, June 22==
# Set up transfer from gel to membrane and do overnight incubation on Western.

==Friday, June 23==
#Image Western
#Order BioRad gradient gel.  
#Do old-school transformation.
#Do characteristic digest of pGEV (Acc1 - when it arrives)
##also other enzymes-get from VectorNTI
#Quantify gel data from AM
