= CBD Re-focus (12th Sep 2007) =

== Introduction ==
This report aims to elucidate the limitations of our design and fabrication with relation to our original specifications. Essentially, the final objective is to be able to re-focus the project in a way that is feasible.

== Original Specs ==
The original specifications of our project was defined as such: <br>
* Report cumulative temperature exposure of food 
* Easy to use with visual signals, <font color='green'> + time response </font>

* Improve accuracy of other attempts by meat industry
* System must be stable for length of shelf-life,<font color='green'> how long is that ?</font>
* No contact with food
* <font color='green'> + range of operating temperatures </font>


=== Design ===
The design of the system consists of two components -
* Reporter system - pTet constitutive promoter + Fluorescent reporter
* Chassis - Cell Free systems

<font color='green'>
The design of the system consists of three components - 
* Tempreature Exposure Reporter - pTet constitutive promoter 
* Visual reporter - Fluorescent reporter
* Chassis - Cell Free systems (+ packaging ?) 
</font>


=== Limitations of the Design ===
'''Reporter system''' <br>
* GFP is not a visual signal; unless DsRed-Express delivers and functions as intended.
** <font color='green'> When DsRed-Express is supposed to be delivered ? When the construct is supposed to be built ?</font>
* Reporter system stops working at 10oC.
** <font color='green'> Do you have any data showing that the system works above 10oC, and below room temperature ?</font>
* Non-linear kinetics in relation to temperature.
** <font color='green'>Non-linear is ok, non-monotonic is a problem.</font>

The last two points may be more or less due to the limitations of our chassis. <font color='green'> Explain, it is not obvious to me </font>


''' Chassis''' <br>
* Papers suggest that ''E. coli'' halts protein synthesis at 7.8&deg;C. <font color='green'> In vitro ? In Vivo? which papers ???)</font>
* Coupled transcription-translation machinery is halted at the initiation of translation both ''in vivo'' and ''in vitro''. This is due to a few factors:
** Increased/induced stability of secondary RNA structure. <font color='green'> Have we checked the possible secondary structures of our specific construct ?</font>
** Reduced coupling of 70S ribosomal subunits.
** No induced response of cold-shock genes (due to removal of ''E. coli'' DNA). These include CspA, IF2 and other protein chaperones.  <font color='green'>You mean that the folding of the protein produced could be disrupted ? Because the rest of the gene expression machinery is already folded.</font>
* In addition, the optimal synthesis of proteins ''in vitro'' is 25&deg;C. Further increase in temperature leads to counter-production of proteins as RNase begins to break down mRNA at a faster rate than transcription rates.

Papers  <font color='green'> (which paper ?)</font>however describe the build-up of nontranslating ribosomes and mRNA within ''in vivo'' and ''in vitro'' systems, although ribosomal proteins levels appear normal. 

Indeed there is a 'cold-shock' adaptation model in which protein synthesis is halted at initiation of ribosomal translation near 15&deg;C, resulting in the induction of proteins that aid in resuming translation before re-commencement of protein synthesis when the ribosome and other factors are more 'adapted' to cold-shock translation.

A good point to note is also that the elongation process for both transcription and translation rates are proportional to temperatures up to 44&deg;C.

=== What does this mean ===
From the perspective of our specs, we have accomplished the 2 specs, but falter in the first three. While DsRed-Express should give us the visual signal required, it is unlikely the design, without subjecting to changes, would meet the first requirement of reporting the cumulative thermal exposure of food. This is because the minimal operating range for our system should be 4oC, not 7.8oC, or whatever the operating range our experiments provide. This also suggests the likelihood that if our device were to proceed as such, it would be more of a threshold device.
* <font color='green'> A threshold device would mean that as soon as you reach a given temperature, you are reporting the event. However, with the construct presented here, the temperature can have a spike at 30oC for 5 seconds, and the device will not record, or report the event. You would need to have a very sensitive toogle-switch, for example, to claim that you have a threshold detector</font>

== Notes on Re-focus attempt ==
* Market as a threshold device as opposed to a cumulative one?
* Change specifications such that it only reports temperatures from minimal temperature range onwards
* RNA as a quantifying product? (RNA synthesis is reduced to 20% of the transcription rate of. 25oC at 5oC)
* Others.
