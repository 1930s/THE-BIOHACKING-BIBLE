==Precipitation of EGFP, 434OR21/321==
rescue them afterwards and run a gel to check

==PCR double repressors==
This is a second time, just in case we used up all the products last time

==Miniprep of T1TE-T1T2-pcc010==
digestion test using ClaI and ScaI in H buffer, but failed

I am sure the plasmid is right, next I will change some other endonucleae to see!

==PCR of parts for switch the third time==
This time we have rescued most of the parts we need in the future!

Together with the first 2 times, we got every parts for at least once.

==ligation of I7100 with SDY-EGFP, 434OR321/21==
Transformation afterwards and overnight culivation
