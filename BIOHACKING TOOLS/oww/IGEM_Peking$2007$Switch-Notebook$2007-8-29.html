==Preparation of liquid medium LB and LB Amp==

==miniprep and digestion test==
sulA, RS2, RD3-plx012 plasmid is isolated.

Double digestion system:

H buffer 2uL

plasmid 7uL

XhoI/SalI 0.25uL each

ddH2O 10.5uL

==colony PCR of LacIq-T==
many colonies are right!

==ligation of CD2 with plx012==

==re-digestion of CD1-plx012==
plasmid 7uL

buffer H 2uL

XhoI/NdeI 0.5uL each

H2O 10uL to a total 20uL system

result: right!

==sequencing of LacIq-pcc009==
No signal. There must be a problem with either our plasmid or the primer!
