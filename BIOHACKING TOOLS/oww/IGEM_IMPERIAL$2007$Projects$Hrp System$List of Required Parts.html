This is the list of required parts that can be obtained from the registry and are needed for the project.

===Promoters===
List input promoters, find/measure PoPS in of the following promoters:
*'''LuxR Promoter'''

[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_F2620 BBa_F2620]

Short description: A transcription factor [LuxR] (''[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_C0062 C0062]'') that is active in the presence of cell-cell signaling molecule [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/3OC6HSL 3OC<sub>6</sub>HSL] is controlled by a tetR regulatable operator (''[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_R0040 BBa_R0040]'').  ''Device input'' is [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/3OC6HSL 3OC<sub>6</sub>HSL].  ''Device output'' is [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/PoPS PoPS] from a LuxR-regulated operator.  If used in a cell containing TetR then a second input signal such as [[ATc|aTc]] can be used to produce a logical AND function.

*'''Constitutive promoter family'''

[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_J23119 BBa_J23119 ]

Short desccription: Parts J23100 through J23119 are a family of constitutive promoter parts isolated from a small combinatorial library. J23119 is the "consensus" promoter sequence and the strongest member of the family. Part J23119 is present in pSB1A2. 

*'''Promoter P(Lac) IQ'''

[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_I14032 BBa_I14032 ]

Short description: Constitutive Promoter, High Transcription 

*'''Promoter (tetR, negative)'''

[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_R0040 BBa_R0040 ]

Short description: Medium strength promoter. Sequence for pTet inverting regulator driven by the TetR protein. Action is inhibited by the addition of tetracycline or its analog, aTc. 

*'''Promoter (lambda cI regulated)''' 

[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_R0051 BBa_R0051]

Short description: The cI regulated promoter is based on the pR promoter from bacteriophage lambda. The promoter has two DNA binding sites for lambda cI repressor BBa_C0051. cI binding results in repression of transcription. The specific sequence used here is based on the cI repressible promoter used in the Elowitz repressilator (and references therein). 

*'''CMV promoter''' 

[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_J52034 BBa_J52034]

Short description: CMV promoter with RBS region, used for testing of our reporter constructs. CMV promotor is a constitutive promotor. 


===Ribosome Binding Sites===

*'''RBS (Elowitz)'''

[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_B0034 BBa_B0034]

Short description: This is the most efficient RBS in the registry, and sets the 1.0 efficiency standard. It is based on the Elowitz repressilator.

===Terminators===

*'''Double terminator (B0010-B0012)'''

[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_B0015 BBa_B0015]

Short description: Double terminator consisting of BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012. This is the most commonly used terminator. It seems to be reliable.
forward_efficiency: 0.984  
reverse_efficiency: 0.295
