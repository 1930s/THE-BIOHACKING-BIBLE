'''KCM-competent cell heat shock (don't use this procedure for ligation products or cotransformations)'''<br>
 1. create cocktail on ice<br>
   *20 uL TGI cells (for a cotransformation use 100uL of cells)<br>
   *10 uL KCM buffer<br>
   *70 uL water<br>
   *1 uL plasmid (for cotransformation use 2uL of each plasmid)<br>
 2. heat shock for 1.5 min at 42 C <br>
 3. incubate on ice for 5 min. <br>
 3.5 If antibiotic marker is anything but Amp then rescue cells in ~100uL (or about equal volume) LB for one hour at 37C.<br>
 4. plate <br>

'''Transformation of Ligation mix( use for ligation product transformations or cotransformations)'''
 1. Create cocktail on ice<br>
   *100 uL TGI cells<br>
   *15 uL KCM buffer<br>
   *25 uL water<br>
   *10 uL plasmid<br>
 2. Incubate on ice for 10 min.<br>
 3. Heat shock for 1.5 min at 42 C <br>
 4. Rescue: add 150uL of SOB media <br>
 5. Incubate in 37 C shaker for 1 hour<br>
 6. Plate<br>

'''Electro Shock Competence'''<br>
 1. Set volts: 1.60 (slow thaw cells on ice) Use 2YT media or SOB media<br>
 2. Put 50 uL of cells into clean eppendorf and limit bubbles. Add 1 uL of ligation mixture and stir to mix.<br>
 3. Pipette into electro cuvette with its cap off. Tap down to bottom, dry the tube<br>
 4. Put into holds, well seated in back <br>
 5. After beep, rescue with 500 uL(have ready) of media. Transfer all volume back to eppendorf, no longer on ice.<br>
