==Description==
The GSC Representatives represent BE at meetings of the Graduate Student Council, keep the BE board informed about the GSC, monitor the BE Board's Association of Student Activities membership and seek additional funding for BE events through these avenues.

There is one GSC rep on the Board, plus the first-year rep is also encouraged to serve as a second rep for experience and funding.

Having a GSC member makes BE events eligible for GSC funding ($250 per rep).  Joining a GSC committee makes us eligible for even more money.
