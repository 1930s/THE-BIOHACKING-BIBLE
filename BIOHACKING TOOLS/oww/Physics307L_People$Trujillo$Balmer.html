=Balmer Series=

===Objective===
To learn how to calibrate and use the spectrometer to determine the wavelengths of certain spectra to determine the Balmer series and Rydberg constant.

'''Summary'''

And of course the excel file that I have in my notebook is corrupted. Apperantly our calibration data is off but for some reason the values we calculated for the Rydberg constants are within accepted values. I didnt expand the Balmer series as many students did.
