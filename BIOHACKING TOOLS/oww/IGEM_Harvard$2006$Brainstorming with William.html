<br>

==What are the enabling features? (Can be optional features)==
'''These are general capabilities for which there may or may not exist demand outside the field'''
*Rigid or defined structure
*Getting things in and out
*Non-porous &rarr; doesn't leak in or out

*'''Allows multiplexed microenvironments'''
*Selective permeability
*Ability to fuse or separate
*Caging and release

<br>

==What are potential applications for containers?==
'''These are applications for which one suspects there may be demand in the outside community'''
*Drug and gene delivery
**Issues
***Slow down the clearance time in plasma and intracellularly
***Size of pores
***Getting into cell
*Directed evolution (compartmentalized selections)
*Chemical synthesis
**Increase effective concentration of reactants
**Using multiplexing for combinatorial synthesis
*Protein folding (chaperone)
*Capture and stabilization of multiprotein complexes
*Marker scavenging
*Cell sorting (gattaca technology)
<br>

==What are demand-meeting applications for containers?==
'''Can move items from the "potential applications" list down to this list when you can find specific examples (i.e. names of molecules involved) where a demand exists for this application; for many people, this is the only list that matters'''
<br>


==How exactly to implement container and lid?==
<br>
<br>
