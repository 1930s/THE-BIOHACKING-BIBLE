==General Notes==

*remove plain A/T plates from 37 room (checking for plate contamination) -'''done'''
*run a gel of pchBA/etc. -'''done'''
*topo PCR THI3
*digest BAT@ with XP, 3 part assemble RBS-BAT2
*transform
*'''[[User:Bcanton|BC]] 18:57, 7 August 2006 (EDT)''': I recommend you try both with the [[Phosphatase treatment of linearized vector|"freeze" step (nice name!)]] and without it as some people don't find this to be a helpful reaction.
*'''received an agar stab of DH5alpha E. coli cells with the pUCP22 pseudomonas shuttle vector in it. Plated/streaked to recover cells on an Amp plate today. This is cool news'''

==LCs==
*LC all colonies in A/T LB
*LC 1-3 and 9,10 in A/T LB supplemented with correct concentration of Isoamyl Alcohol (check with Veena for concentration/volume)
*LC 4-8 and 11-15 in A/T LB supplemented with 300-350 &mu;M Salicylic Acid (40 &mu;L in 10 mL LC)
**'''FINALLY...SOME SMELL TESTS to be conducted tomorrow am!!!'''

==Competent Indole KO Strain==
*Transform with R0040.RBS.BSMT.B0015 (J45100 for B0030 and J45102 for B0032), 
*Transform with R0040.RBS.ATF1-1148.B0015 
*Transform with J45993.RBS.BSMT.B0015
*Transform with J45993.RBS.ATF1-1148.B0015
**Ligations from 8/7 are saved in our freezer in a tip box!!

==''IAGD''==
*Cut BAT2 with XP
**3 part assemble with B0030:ES and A/T:EP
**3 part assemble with B0032:ES and A/T:EP

==Transformations==
#6 IK A/T plates (8/7 ligation mixes 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8)
#2 RBS-BAT2 3-part A/T assemblies (using 30 and 32)
#2 THI3 topos (using old and new pcr product) 
#2 osmY-E0840 3-part A/T assemblies (using reg. cut E0840 and Gel extracted version)
#2 puc18 controls (using Top10 cells and IK cells)

==New THI3-mut primers==
*ordered primer pair 1, without the first C because it contributed to a hairpin
