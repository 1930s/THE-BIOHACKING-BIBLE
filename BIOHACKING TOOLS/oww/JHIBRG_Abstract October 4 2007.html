''Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia 1 Regulates Integration of Newly Generated Neurons in the Adult Brain''


Adult neurogenesis occurs throughout life in discrete regions of the adultmammalian brain. Little
is known about the mechanism governing the sequential developmental process that leads to
integration of new neurons from adult neural stem cells into the existing circuitry.
The role of Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia1 (DISC1), a schizophrenia susceptibility gene, in adult hippocampal neurogenesis will be discussed. 
Unexpectedly,downregulation of DISC1 leads to acceleratedneuronal integration, resulting in aberrant
morphological development and mispositioning of new dentate granule cells in a cell-autonomous
fashion. Functionally, newborn neurons with DISC1 knockdown exhibit enhanced excitability
and accelerated dendritic development and synapse formation. Furthermore, DISC1 cooperates
with its binding partner NDEL1 and Fez1 in regulating adult neurogenesis.
