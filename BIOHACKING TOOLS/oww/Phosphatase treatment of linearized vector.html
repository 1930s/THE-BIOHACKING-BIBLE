To minimize self-ligated vector in your transformation, treat your linearized vector with a phosphatase to remove the 5' phosphates necessary for ligation.  This should improve the percentage of colonies with inserts.

==Materials==

*Linear DNA from [[Restriction digest | restriction digest]] (heat-inactivation of restriction enzymes is necessary but [[Purification of DNA | DNA purification]] is not).
*[[Antarctic Phosphatase]]
*10X Antarctic Phosphatase buffer

==Procedure==

#Add Antarctic Phosphatase buffer to a final concentration of 1X to linearized vector sample.
#Add 1&mu;L Antarctic Phosphatase (probably should make final glycerol concentration less that 5%?)
#Incubate 60 mins at 37&deg;C.  <br> This should be sufficient to remove 5' phosphates even from 5' recessed ends like those produced by Pst I.
#Heat-inactivate for 5 mins at 65&deg;C.
#Proceed directly to [[DNA ligation | ligation]] step.
