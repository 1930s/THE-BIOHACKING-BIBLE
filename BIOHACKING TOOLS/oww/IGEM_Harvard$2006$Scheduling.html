An old man is sitting on a park bench crying. A young man is walking by and asks him why he's crying. The old man says, "I'm retired and I have lots of money, a huge luxury apartment, and a beautiful 25 year old wife who loves me."
The young man says, "Well then why the hell are you crying!?"

The old man replies, "I can't remember where I live!"
