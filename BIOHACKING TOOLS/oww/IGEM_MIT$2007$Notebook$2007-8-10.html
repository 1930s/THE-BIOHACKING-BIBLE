#Run Western Blot (at Belcher Lab with Rana and Robbie)

==Updated Western Blot Protocol==
===Preparing Samples/Inducing===
:1. Grow Overnight
:2. Dilute to OD 0.15 and Induce
:3. Incubate @ 37C on Shaker for 1 hour until grown to OD of approximately 0.4
:4. Spin down 1 mL
:5. Resuspend in 20Âµl water
:6. Add Loading Buffer
:7. Heat
:8. Load Gel
:9. Run for 30 minutes @ 400V

===Transfer===
*Order of layers: 2 pieces padding, filter paper, gel, transfer membrane, filter paper, 2 pieces padding
*Run for 1 hour @ 30V

===Blocking/ Antibodies===
:1. Block for 1 hour on shaker in 0.5% Milk in 0.1% TBS+Tween
:2. Wash 3 times for 5 minutes in TBS+Tween
:3. Shake for 1 hour in primary T7 Mouse Monoclonal Antibody (1:10,000 dilution, 40ng/mL) diluted in Blocking Buffer
:4. Wash 5 times
:5. Shake for 1 hour in secondary Goat Anti-Mouse Antibody (1:2,000 dilution, 0.5ng/mL) diluted in Blocking Buffer
:6. Wash 5 times

===Imaging===
:1. Dip in substrate
:2. Image using Kodak program
:3. Take image without fluorescence first to record ladder position
:4. Preview and calculate necessary exposure time
:5. Image and save to desktop (email)


==Western Blot==
Lanes:
<pre>
1  Invitrogen BenchMark Ladder
2  T  1E-5
3  T  1E-7
4  T  1E-8
5  T  0
6  U  1E-5
7  U  1E-8
8  U  0
9  Positive Control
</pre>

Key:

T = DH5a transformed with F2620.B0034.CPX in plasmid pSB1AC3

U = DH5a untransformed

Numbers = concentration of AHL added to culture to induce transcription

There are four extra bands in lanes with transformed cells.  Zero bands in non-transformed cells.  Extra bands may be from: ampR, cmR...?  Will insert a transcriptional stop via Standard Assembly.
