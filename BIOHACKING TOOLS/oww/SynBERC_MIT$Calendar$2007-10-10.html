Mo Khalil on M13.

From Mo:

My work is two-fold: (1) I've been studying the single-molecule mechanics of M13 bacteriophage using optical tweezers and (2) I'm trying to use M13 as a template for expressing peptides/proteins of interest and then studying their mechanics (this way, M13 serves as the single-molecule handle and the vehicle that carries the protein of interest).
