What I want: fast (cell permeant) plasmid DNA replication inhibitor that doesn't interfere with transcription or protein synthesis

Possibilities: drugs, operator arrays, trx through ori, ts-alleles, combinations


== Classes of drugs (generally defined by cellular target) ==

===Gyrase inhibitors===
Good review in Biochemistry 27(7):2253, Karl Drlica and Robert Franco, 1988.
====gyrA====
quinolones (naladixic acid, oxolinic acid, ciprofloxacin)<br>
MOA: create gyrase-DNA adduct that can be processed into strand breaks by protein denaturation.



====gyrB====
coumarins (novobiocin, coumermycin A1)



The good: fast and full inhibition

The bad: also interferes with RNA polymerase, affects transcription of different genes to varying degree

===Polymerase inhibitors===
nucleotide analogs - generally not permeant<br>
cells can be made permeable with toluene and other treatments

===Helicase (eg. DnaB, RepA of pRSF1010) inhibitors===
Flavones  [http://sfx.hul.harvard.edu/sfx_local?id=pmid:11812837&sid=libx:hul.harvard]

===DNA intercalators===
ethidium<br>
acridine

===Nucleotide reductase inhibitors===
Hydroxyurea (HU)(use at 50mM, make fresh 1M stock in water or media; some store at -20deg as 1M stock)

The good: 1)fast inhibition; 2) limited effect on RNA synthesis, protein synthesis, cell viability; 3) reversible(?);  4) better than ts-allele of nrdA

The bad: 1) in Bacillus HU has preferential effect on chromosomal DNA replication, very little effect on plasmid replication
[http://sfx.hul.harvard.edu/sfx_local?id=pmid:102636&sid=libx:hul.harvard]<br>
2) also preferential effect on chromosome replication found in ''Proteus mirabilis'' (Mol.Gen.Genet. 138:281, 75)

==thermosensitive alleles==
===dnaA===
large collection of well characterized alleles, but R1 replication is DnaA independent! and different ori's 
have different DnaA dependencies
===pol###===

===nrdA101===
interesting allele, but not good for my purposes (see HU ref, 2007)
