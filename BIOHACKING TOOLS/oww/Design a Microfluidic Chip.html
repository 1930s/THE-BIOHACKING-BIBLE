The process of designing a microfluidic chip to be ordered from the [http://thebigone.stanford.edu/foundry/ Caltech Foundry ]  is not hard but it is a little involved.

==Steps==

#Learn the design rules 
#Make a rough outline of your chip design
#*This should be influenced by previous designs as well as constraints of the design rules
#gain a (rudimentary) understanding of AutoCAD
#Create a schematic of your chip in autoCAD
