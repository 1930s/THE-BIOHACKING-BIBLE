== Protocol for the Immunostaining of Biotin-Streptavidin System ==

#Fix the cells with 2-4% paraformaldehyde containing 1mM Na3VO4 at RT for 15-30min.
#3x 5min/each wash in PBS containing 1mM Na3VO4.
#Permeabilize with 0.1-0.5% TX-100 in PBS containing 1mM Na3VO4 for 15-30 min, at RT
#Apply 1-2 drops of the streptavidin (molecular probes, E-21390), incubate for 15-30min at RT
#Rinse thoroughly with PBS containing 1mM Na3VO4, 1x wash 5min
#Apply 1-2 drops of biotin, incubate for 15-30min, at RT
#Rinse thoroughly with PBS containing 1mM Na3VO4, 1x wash 5min
#Incubate with 3% goat normal serum or 1% BSA for 20 min, at RT
#Wash 1x PBS, 5 min/each, at RT
#Incubate primary antibody (1:100, 10ug/ml) in (optional, 0.1%TX-100, 1% goat normal serum), at RT for 2 hr or 4oC O/N,  in PBS containing 1mM Na3VO4.
#Wash 3X PBS, 5min/each, at RT
#Incubate biotinylated anti-mouse (from goat) (1:200 or 1:100) in (optional, 0.1%TX-100) PBS, at RT for 1 hr
#3x PBS wash, 5 min/each, at RT
#Incubate FITC-streptavidin (1:200) in PBS, at RT for 30 min
#3x PBS wash, 5min/each, at RT
#Optional: double staining, continue routine immunostaining if primary abs are from Rabbit. 
#*Caution! If primary Abs are fromGoat, do Goat Staining first and keep 1mM Na3VO4 in all the solution used.
