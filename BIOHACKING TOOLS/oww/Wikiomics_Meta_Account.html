== Why create a wiki account? ==

This is not a requirement and nobody will bother you if you remain anonymous, but it will be more comfortable for you if you add some significant material into the wiki:

* Your name will appear in the history of each page, which marks you as the original contributor.
* You can be notified by email when someone modifies a page, for instance one you wrote. For this to be active, log in, follow the ''preferences'' link at the top of the page, check the appropriate boxes and confirm your email address.
* If people know your name or your nickname, they might trust you more than an unknown IP adress, and at least other wiki users can send you email (that's an option), in case they have something to tell you.
* Other users can contact you
