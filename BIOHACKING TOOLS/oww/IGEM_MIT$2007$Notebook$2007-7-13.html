==Checked Plates of Transformed 3A XL-1==
*LB+Kan Plate - all had significant growth
*LB+Kan+Amp:
**1: very small colonies
**2: no growth
**3: some bits of dead cells on a streak, otherwise no growth
**4: many colonies
**5: no growth
**6: 9 colonies
**7: no growth
**8: no growth
*The growth of colonies on #4 supports the theory that those cells received both pSB3k3 with F2620 and B0034 (Kan, medium copy) and religated pSB1A3 with just F2620 (Amp, high copy)

==Diluted LC#1,2 of XL-1 3A in LB+Kan==
*Since those only grew on LB+Kan and not LB+Kan+Amp plate
*for miniprep tomorrow
*37C at 3:30pm

==Transformed Standard Assembly Ligation of E1010 into pSB3k3 from Yesterday==
*made 8 plates total, 2 samples
*37C @ 4:30pm

==Received from Tom Knight digested pSB(1A3, 1AT3, 1AK3) vectors & Chemically Competent Cells==
*vectors digested with EcoRI and PstI, placed in -20C
*cells placed in -80C, labeled iGEM2007


==Meeting with Drew and TK Notes==
*check to see if Kan resistant already

*ask for digested vector--tom knight is on it

*terminators

*make a color scheme as orgzn tool to display

*Full product cycle
**What to do at the end?
**Hidden costs for disposal



*Target market
**rich
**poor too
**Find Mass PCR things


*Different application
**modification; disrupt bioaccumulation in food chain

*make a salt or something, mercury crystal ->more valuable, recoverable, disposal

*Diane Newman 3rd floor.
**Magnetites, etc., go talk to her

*Safety conversations
**EHS website for Mercury

*MerA leave it in?
**Could be MerB/C

*Price of Mercury/Cadmium


*List of Target Metals
**Then explain why this one, and not that ones
**Bad/good/metal-specific opportunities
**any number of good reasons/Markets/etc
**Compare different ones

*Does Mercury contamination exist in medium sized?

*Other bacterial species
**Pseudomonus--robust

*So measurements/experiments
**Plan of attack
**Figure out how to quantitate, figure out parameters about stickiness


*Measurement of ions

*Figure out which version of mercury, +1?  Most have been +2



*Presentation Divisions
**Put together part of the talk
**Do earlier than later
**Make our own slides
