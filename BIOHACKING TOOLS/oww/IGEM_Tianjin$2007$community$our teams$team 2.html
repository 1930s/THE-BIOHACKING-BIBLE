====Introduction====
We come from Tianjin University, one of the most famous universities in China. Our team is composed of fifteen creative young people with enormous passion for 

synthetic biology. The solid foundation of professional knowledge provides us firm confidence, and the enthusiastic research spirit gives us the courage to challenge 

the mystery of science. We believe that everything can be possible with our endeavor and wisdom.

Prof. X.M. Zhao is kind enough to provide ‘wet’ experiments environment and ‘dry’ experiment equipment for us.
====Project 1====
'''ene circuit'''
The aim of our project is to simulate electrocircuit in series and parallel connection by gene elements. Series circuit and parallel circuit are the simplest circuits 

in physics. There are three eletments in it: switch, power and resistance. What we should do is to construct three kinds of bacterials functioning as the three 

elements in electrocircuit, seperately: one for power, the other two for resistances(R1 and R2). Light is used as a switch. The gene circuit is connected when the 

bacterials are supposed to light so that the flurescence proteins with different colors in the three kind of bacterials are all expressed, while the circuit is cut 

when we turn the light off. In series circuit, If we cut any of the resistances or power, it will result in the disconnection of the whole circuit, while in parallel 

circuit, the lack of one resistance will not influence the other one. Three different kinds of HSL are used as the cell to cell signals.
====Project 2====
'''Bacterial neon light'''
In this project ,we use gene circle to create a bacterial neon light with three different colors. the first repressor protein, LacI from E. coli, inhibits the 

transcription of the second repressor gene, tetR from the tetracycline-resistance transposon Tn10, whose protein product in turn inhibits the expression of a third 

gene, cI from λ phage. Finally, CI inhibits lacI expression, completing the cycle. The three repressors are connected with red, green, and yellow luc genes (a kind 

of luminescent gene) seperately. With the oscillation of the gene circle, the three colors of light will show up circularly, just as a neon light.
