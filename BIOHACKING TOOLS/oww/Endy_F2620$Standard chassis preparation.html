Wherever possible, we prepare chassis bearing T9002 using the standard method described below.  This insures uniformity of conditions between different experiments and repeats.

#Inoculate 5ml of [[Endy:M9 media/supplemented|Supplemented M9 medium]] and antibiotic (kanamycin, 20Î¼g/ml) with a single colony from a fresh plate. Grow the culture in a 17mm test tube for 15hrs at 37C with shaking at 70rpm. 
#Dilute the culture 1:1000 into 5ml of fresh medium and grow for an additional 5 hours under the same conditions.
