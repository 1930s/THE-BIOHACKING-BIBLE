1. Plasmids (2 samples each)
    R0010: lac operon promoter
    E7104: T7 promoter + GFP
    E0241: GFP
2. Protocol
    - w/ 5mL samples, 1mL saved for glycerol stock
    - rest of samples transferred to 1.5 eppendorfs and centrifuged to form pellet
    - supernatant removed and pellet resuspended in 250{{uL}} Buffer P1
    - 250{{uL}} Buffer P2 added and tube inverted 4-6 times for mixing
       (no vortexing to prevent shearing of genomic DNA; let sit for no longer than 5 min)
    - 350{{uL}} Buffer N3 added and tube inverted 4-6 times for mixing
    - centrifuged @ 13,000rpm for 10 min
       (formation of white pellet)
    - supernatant transferred to QIAprep spin column and centrifuged for 1 min
    - 0.5mL Buffer PB added and centrifuged for 1 min
       (optional)
    - added 0.75mL Buffer PE for washing and centrifuged for 1 min
    - flowthrough discarded and centrifuged for 1 min to remove residual buffer
    - QIAprep column transferred to 1.5 eppendorfs
    - 50{{uL}} water added to center of column
       (let column stand for 1 min)
    - centrifuged for 1 min
    - nanodropped


===''Digestion''===
1. Materials
    8{{uL}} DNA (R0010, E0241)
    2.5{{uL}} 10x BSA
    2.5{{uL}} 10x Buffer (Buffer 2)
    11{{uL}} dH2O
    0.5{{uL}} enzyme 1 and 2 (SpeI and PstI, XbaI and PstI)
    total vol = 25{{uL}}
2. Protocol
    - checked www.neb.com to determine correct Buffer
    - digested @ 37dC for 1 hr
    - heat shocked @ 97dc for 15 min to inactivate restriction enzymes
    - added 0.1{{uL}} (1 unit) of 10,000units/mL CIP to vector DNA (R0010)
    - incubated vector DNA @ 37dC for 1 hr
