== Protocol for Cysteine Conjugation ==

*written by [[user:ziz|Nora]]
''this protocol is specific for the molecules to which I conjugate cysteines, but could be applied to any molecule''

'''protein'''
*resuspend lyophilized protein from NiNTA elution in water, measure concentration via Edelhoch, aliquot to 100 nmol in tubes, and lyophilize
*resuspend a 100 nmol aliquot in 1 ml 1xTBS (50 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) + 5 M GuHCl for 100 μM
*reduce protein by adding 2 μl of 500 mM TCEP to each sample for 1 mM
*heat 5 min, incubate RT 1 hr
'''for conjugation with iodoacetamide (IA)'''
*IA - VWR 80055-298, 185 g/mol
*want 20-200 μmol IA for 100 nmol of each protein
*resuspend enough IA for number of samples in 1x TBS + 5M GuHCl to 1M
*add 2.4-240 μl IA to each protein for final conc. of 20-200 mM 
*incubate 2 hr RT rocking
*purify by HPLC
'''for conjugation with fluorophores'''
*fluorescein maleimide (fluor/F) - Invitrogen F150, 427.37 g/mol
**want 1μmol fluor for 100 nmol of each protein 
**resuspend enough fluor for number of samples in DMF for 20 mM
**add 50 μl of fluor to each protein for final conc. of 1 mM
*Alexa Fluor 568 maleimide (Alexa/A) - Invitrogen A20341, 880.92 g/mol
**want 0.5 μmol Alexa for 50 nmol of each protein
**resuspend 1 tube (1mg) in 113.5 ul DMSO for 10 mM (good for two proteins)
**add 50 μl of Alexa to each protein for final conc. of 1 mM
*incubate 4 hr RT rocking
*use Pierce Zeba 5 ml desalting column (cat # 89892) to remove unreacted fluorophore
**rinse columns 2x with 2.5 ml 1x TBS + 5 M GuHCl 
**add each sample to a separate column
**rinse tubes with 100 μl (Alexa) or 200 μl (fluor) 1x TBS + 5 M GuHCl and add to columns
*determine concentration of samples at 280 and 490 nm (fluor) or 575 nm (Alexa) by measuring spectrum from 650 or 520-240
*take out 5 μl to run on a gel and 10 μl to run on analytical HPLC
*aliquot in 5 tubes of 10-20 nmol each according to fluorophore concentration and rest in another tube and freeze at -80°C
