== Bradford Assay==
 
 
1) 1 in 5 dilution of Bradford assay solution 
*4ml in 16ml of dH2O 
*Small stock in the fridge, main stock in the cold cabinet)
*(light sensitive) 
2) Use 1mg/ml BSA as a standard protein  
*Dilute different amount of BSA (0.1-1{{ug}}) 
3) Place 200{{uL}} of diluted protein into the well of 96 well plate.
 
4) Make different dilution of your sample protein and then measure absorbance at 595nm, then calculate concentration using BSA standard curve.
