==Polo suggestion==

===what is our decision now? i need it asap! Thanks===
* by jimmy
===Sizes=== 
:'''Men-Poloshirt - edit the number of size you want (UK sizes):'''
::1 x Small (Jonny)
::1 x Medium (JohnC)
::1 x Large (John Sy) 
::? x XLarge
:'''Women-Poloshirt - edit the number of size you want:'''
::? x Small
::1 x Medium (Christin)
::? x Large 
:Whoever does not respond is being allocated a size...

===Color of polo & logo===
:JohnS and Deepti expressed their preference for blue&yellow. 
:Vincent for blue&blue. 
:Christin for red&white. 
:Colour of polo - a dark colour I would say, except if we take the blue&blue logo
:Since you are the one in charge of ordering, Jimmmy, you can make the final decision. 

===Position of Logos===
:As outlined in the picture - additionally, we could have the logo printed in bigger in the middle of the back of the shirt. 

===Logo itself===
:Should include the year


'''We need to decide on several points:'''
* color of the Polo (I would say white or dark blue)
* color of the I.Coli logo (I would say the blue one, maybe different background if polo is dark blue)
* size and position of both logos

'''We need to provide ASAP to Jimmy:'''
*a mock-up of the Polo with clear position of the logos
*very high resolution of both logos (>300-400dpi)

==New Draft== 
 <font color="#FF8000"><b>Special thanks to Dora Dong Weijia for designing this set of Logos!</b> </font color>
Personally don't think it's nicer than before though because it is not so compact... open to suggestion
*Should highlight "Imperial COllege London Igem"(all the capital letters should be in different colours from the other letters) 
'''[[User:Cys|Christin]] 18:05, 7 September 2006 (EDT)''': Hope these comments come still in time.... 
*I think we should also include the year - Imperial College London Igem 2006
*For the blue and yellow one (I think the yellow writing and blue DNA is much nicer than vice versa) - could we get a lighter blue for the DNA? For example that light blue of the blue-coloured logo suggestion. 
*[[User:Johnsy|Johnsy]] 09:57, 7 September 2006 (EDT): I personally like the blue and yellow one....
*[[User:Da104|Da104]] 04:54, 8 September 2006 (EDT): Yellow and Blue is also my favourite. I agree with Christin;s comments though- all capital letters in a stronger shade of blue, the small letters in a lighter shade perhaps? Keep it subtle though- we don't want tacky!!!<br>

==Tom Draft==

Hi guys, did a little photoshopping on the logo to show off some ideas of how I think it should look

===Idea 1===

Same as Jimmy's friend's one really, except the DNA has been rotated and englarged to make the I look better.

[[image:TomIcoli1.png|thumb|150px]]

===Idea 2===

I didn't think the DNA was easily distinguisahble as DNA on idea 1, so extended it out of the box. I think this one looks really nice (well, if my photoshop skills could clear up the rubbish) with the box highlighting the I as an I. The C would have to change colour though as its not in the box anymore

[[Image:TomIcoli2.png|thumb|150px]]

What do you think? <br>
*''[[User:Da104|Da104]] 05:14, 31 August 2006 (EDT)'' I like it!! I'm with Christin in saying little "O", "C" the same colour as "oLi" and please please please let's get rid of the awful brown!!! (ask Jonny for colours!!!)

==Second Draft==

 <font color="#FF8000"><b>Specail thanks to Dora Dong Weijia for refining the logos!</b> </font color>
'''[[User:Cys|Christin]]''': Good job! I really like the new design. 
*Some suggestions for amendments: 
**Small 'o' in I.CoLi
**Shifting the I a bit downwards and making the contrast a bit more obvious
**iGEM in a new line and add 2006 to it
**Colours: dark red, red/orange, periwinkle/blue
**Perhaps a shade of the colour within the rectangle with the upper part being more intense, the lower part being lighter ?! (or vice versa)

'''[[User:Johnsy|Johnsy]]''': It might be nicer to move the Imperial College iGEM part closer to the I.Coli part.  They seem very far apart.  Also, the first I needs to be darker, since you have a light background for the DNA.  Overall, quite a nice design though

'''[[User:TomH|Tom]]''': Yeah, I agree with Christin's comments. Not sure about the idea of shading though. 
*I think the DNA needs to be tilted clockwise more, so we can get a straigher I. If that means some kind of overlap of DNA with the C of Coli then so be it.
*It might mean having to crop the top of the brown box down a bit, and moving the 'Imperial college..' thing below the logo.
*And I also think the I should be bigger, should be the biggest letter!
