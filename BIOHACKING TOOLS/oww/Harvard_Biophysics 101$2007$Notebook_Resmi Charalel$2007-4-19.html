==Issues==
*I think I have an appropriate algorithm for deriving keywords and printing some PMIDs.  However, I keep getting this weird error message that says my spacing is incorrect and when I follow the given instructions, I get the same error.  - Somehow this error disappeared.
*I am still having a few issues in terms of implementing what I hope to do in the code - there is very little documentation for accessing PubMed in this fashion.  The code below is the code I have added thus far to Xiaodi's general code.  Everything works up until the last stanza of the program.

==Program So Far==
<pre>
from Bio import PubMed
from Bio import Medline
import string

disease = a.name

search_term = "Review[ptyp] "+disease
#print search_term

review_ids = PubMed.search_for(search_term)

rec_parser = Medline.RecordParser()
medline_dict = PubMed.Dictionary(parser = rec_parser)

count = 1

for did in review_ids[0:5]:
    cur_record = medline_dict[did]
    print '\n', count, ')  ', string.rstrip(cur_record.title), cur_record.authors, string.strip(cur_record.source)
    count=count+1

def extract_allelic_variant_data(str):
        pmid = get_text(v.getElementsByTagName("Mim-reference_pubmedUID")[0].getElementsByTagName("Mim-text_text")[0].childNodes)
        print pmid
        key_source = PubMed.search_for(pmid)
        key_rec = medline_dict[0]
        keywords = get_text(key_rec.getElementsByTagName("MeshHeading")[0].childNodes)
        print keywords

</pre>

==Tasks for Tuesday and Thursday==
*For Tuesday:
**Understand XML code parsing better, so that I can correct errors in previous code to parse out PMIDs from OMIM and then search those PMIDs in PubMed and return key words.
**[[Harvard:Biophysics_101/2007/Notebook:Resmi Charalel/2007-4-24|See Here]] for progress
*For Thursday:
**Brainstorm approaches to dealing with SNPs that are not part of OMIM.
