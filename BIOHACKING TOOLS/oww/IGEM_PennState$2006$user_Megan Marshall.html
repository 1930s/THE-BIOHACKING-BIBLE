<h2 style="color: #AAAAAA">'''About Me'''</h2>
I am in my first year as a post-doc at Penn State University, working in Dr. Richard's lab.  My background is in modeling, sustainable agriculture, and molecular microbial ecology techniques to study microorganisms in complex environments, such as soil and compost.  At Penn State, my research is focused on ensilage as a biomass storage and pretreatment method for cellulosic ethanol production.
