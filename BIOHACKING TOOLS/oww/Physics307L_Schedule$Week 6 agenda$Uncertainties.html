==Key today: Need to assign some uncertainty to every reported measurement==
===Rough estimates are a great start! (and sometimes only way)===
==Mean +/- standard error of the mean==
===aka "standard error", "standard deviation of the mean"===
===From a collection of measurements===
====[[/mean|What is the best estimate of the "true value"?]]====
====[[/stdev|What is the best estimate of the standard deviation of the parent distribution?]]====
====[[/standardError|What is the best estimate of the standard error of the mean?]]====

==Central Limit Theorem Part II==
* Central limit theorem (I): (Last week) distribution of averaged measurments ... (II): distribution of single measurement as a result of a bunch of small, independent, random errors.
