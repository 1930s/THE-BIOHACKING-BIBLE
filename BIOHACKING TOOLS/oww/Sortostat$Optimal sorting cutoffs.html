==Problem==
What is the optimal cut-off percentile for choosing a chamber to be sorted if you have N sorts (trials) remaining until you must take the sort to preserve a constant dilution rate?

==Analytical Solution==

===Definition of variables===

<math>\emph E[X_N] = </math> expected value of the optimal percentage that can be returned from N trials

<math>\emph S_i = </math> random variable representing the percentile returned from the ith trial
*all trials are assumed to be independent therefore <math>\emph S_i = S</math>, for all i
<math>\emph C_i = </math> the cut-off percentile for the ith trial.


===General===
<math>\emph E[X_N] = P(S>C_1) E[S|S>C_1] + </math>


<math>\emph (1-P(S>C_1))(P(S>C_2)E[S|S>C_2]) + </math>


<math>\emph (1-P(S>C_1))(1-P(S>C_2))(P(S>C_3)E[S|S>C_2]) + </math>


<math>\emph ... </math> 


<math>\emph (1-P(S>C_1))(1-P(S>C_2))...(1-P(S>C_{N-1})E[S_N]  </math>


===Simplified===
Since <math>\emph (1-P(S>C_1))</math> can be factored out of every term after the first above, the solution can be simplified and solved recursively:

<math>\emph E[X_N] = P(S>C_N) E[S|S>C_N] + (1-P(S>C_N))E[X_{N-1}]</math>

base case:

<math>\emph E[X_1] = \int_0^\infty P(S)*S dS</math>
* e.g., if you have only 1 trial then you expect to get the mean of the distribution for S.

==Simulation Solution==
Since our probability skills were pretty sad, we ([[Alex Mallet]]) simulated it to confirm our analytical results.  MATLAB file can be found here.
