==Materials==
*100% ETOH
*50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 
*RNAse A 10 mg/ml
*55 mM HCl containing 5 mg/ml Pepsin
*Buffer A:
**10 ml  1M Tris-HCl pH 7.5 (200 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5)
**2 ml    5M NaCl (200 mM NaCl)
**4 ml    1M MgCl<sub>2</sub> (80 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>)
*Propidium Iodide stock (5 mg/ml)


==Procedure==
Day 1:
# 2.5 ml of 6 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml into conical tubes containing 5 ml 100% ETOH 
# Fix overnight on a rocker at the temperature the cells were originially grown
Day 2:
# Pellet and resuspend in 10 ml 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0
# Put on ice for 1-2 h
# Sonicate at setting of ‘4’ for 20 seconds
# Pellet and resuspend in 0.8 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 with 1 mg/ml RNAse A, incubate overnight at 37°C 
#* (1.5 ml 10 mg/ml RNAse A + 13.5 ml 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0)
Day 3:
# Pellet and resuspend in 2 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl containing 5 mg/ml pepsin; incubate for 30 min at 37°C
# Pellet and wash once with 2 ml Buffer A
# Pellet and resuspend in 450 µl Buffer A
# Add 50 ul propidium iodide stock (5mg/ml) to stain cells; final concentration of propidium iodide is 0.5 mg/ml (can be frozen and stored at -20°C at this point)

Transfer 100 µl cells to 400 ul of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 immediately before reading in a FACS machine
