==Welcome to the Wei He Lab wiki at OpenWetWare!==

We are a young lab in the Department of Materials Science & Engineering, and Department of Mechanical, Aerospace & Biomedical Engineering at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Our research effort is directed towards applying materials science & engineering to address critical interfacial issues encountered in neural engineering. In particular, we are focusing on two issues: the compatibility of implantable neural prostheses, and functional artificial graft to bridge nerve gaps. The multi-disciplinary nature of our research incorporates techniques from polymer synthesis, surface chemistry, to micro/nano fabrication, mammalian cell culture, and immunohistology.
