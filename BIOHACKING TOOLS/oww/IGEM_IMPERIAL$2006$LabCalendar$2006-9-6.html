 <u>'''TO DO:'''</u>
 *Maxi & mini of J37036 & J37018
 *Send J37036 for sequencing
 *Make frozen stock of new T9002
 *Culture J37022 for maxi and mini and freezing & TESTING on Thurdsday
 *Culture 1st step of ligation for final predator with new aiiA for maxi & mini on Thursday
 </font color>

==Maxiprep==
*4 x J37036 (a,b,c,d)
*2 x J37018 (a,b)

==Miniprep of J37018 & J37036==

==Testing of J37015==
*2mL overnight culture was grown

In order to test for protein expression (using the GFP attached to the gene): 
*Diluted into OD 0.1 (8mL) at 10:40
*Dilution again into OD 0.1 at 12:10 (OD was at 0.688)
*Taken out of shaker at 15:00 - dilute again into OD 0.1
*Inoculate diluted culture with 3 different AHL concentrations: 
:#10nM AHL
:#1nM AHL
:#0.1nM AHL
:#0nM AHL (Control)
*Put into shaker at 16:00 - leave in shaker to allow GFP expression, kicking off the positive feedback loop with initial AHL concentrations from above

In order to assess any AHL levels that have accumulated overnight: 
*Took morning culture of J37015 (about 1mL left) and spin down the cells to get the supernatant
*J37016 is diluted to OD 0.1 and 1200{{ul}} is inoculated with 800{{ul}} of supernatant of J37015 of morning culture
*Put in shaker at 15:15 - to be taken out at 19:00 (leave for 4hrs for GFP expression to reach steady state)

*Both above experiments taken out at 19:00 & read with Wallac Victor III

==Activity of Acylase==
*Made up enzyme/AHL mix using [http://openwetware.org/wiki/IGEM:IMPERIAL/2006/Protocols/BiosensorEnzymeAct Enzyme Activity Protocol], row H
*Took 2mL of diluted J37016 culture
*Spin down the cells
*Remove supernatant
*Add 2mL of enzyme/AHL mix
*for control: 1980{{ul}} of J37016 & 20{{ul}} AHL (100nM final concentration)
*Put both 5mL tubes into shaker at 16:25
*Taken out at 19:00 & read with Wallac Victor III

==Sequencing==
*Sequenced J37036 - using reverse plasmid primer for A2 (Tm = 56{{c}})

==Culturing==
*Cultured up 2 colonies in 110ml of J37022 from Plate 1 for maxi and mini
*Cultured up 2 colonies in 110ml of J37022 from Plate 2 for maxi and mini
*Cultured up 2 colonies in 110ml of aiiA for maxi and mini
*Cultured up 2 colonies in 2ml of J37022 from Plate 1 for mini
*Cultured up 2 colonies in 2ml of J37022 from Plate 2 for mini
*Cultured up 2 colonies in 2ml of aiiA  for mini
*Cultured up J37016 in 2ml using frozen stock
*Cultured up J37015 in 2ml using frozen stock

==Electroporation of Dr. Fray's plasmid containing aiiA==
*Was not successful because no autoclaved cuvettes were ready to be used
*Looked for any possibly usable cuvettes in vain
*This has to be done first thing tomorrow morning (so we might get colonies in the evening)!!!
