Have on hand before beginning:<br><br>

transcribed RNA that has been DNased<br>
filtered water <br>
filtered 20% ethanol<br>
Q column Buffer A:  10mM Tris pH 7.5, 50mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA (filtered)<br>
Q column Buffer B:  10mM Tris pH 7.5, 1000mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA (filtered)<br>
HiTrap Amersham FF Q column 1 ml with connectors and tubing<br>
5cc syringe without needle<br><br>

Method:<br>
Pre-wash column (stored in 20% filtered Ethanol):<br>
10ml of water<br>
10ml of Buffer A<br>
10ml of Buffer B<br>
10ml of Buffer A<br><br>

dilute 300µl Dnased RNA with 3ml of Buffer A<br>
Load onto column with syringe<br>

wash with:<br>
100% Buffer A 5ml (discard)<br>
40% Buffer B 5ml (1.5ml Buffer B + 3.5ml Buffer A)(these are the NTPs that did not get used, collect in case RNA is in this sample)<br>
100% Buffer A 5ml (discard)<br>
70% Buffer B 5ml (3.5ml Buffer B + 1.5ml Buffer A)(collect this should be your RNA)<br>
100% Buffer B 5ml (discard, this is a wash to clean the column)<br>
100% Buffer A 5ml (discard)<br><br>

Wash with 10ml water<br>
Wash with 10ml 20% ethanol<br>

STORE COLUMN IN FRIDGE CAPPED SO IT CAN'T DRY OUT<br>
<br>
Precipitate the RNA using final concentration of 0.3mM NaOAc pH 5.2 and 67% ethanol (5ml of RNA to 10ml of Ethanol and NaOAc)<br>
Freeze in -80°C for 10min<br>
Spin in JA17 at 14,500rpm (30,000rcf) for 10min<br>
