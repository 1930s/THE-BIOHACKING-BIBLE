*pick colonies and inoculate overnight cultures


==June 7==
*Remove plates from 37C
*Pick 3-5 colonies from each plate, plus 1 spot away from any colony as a control.  I usually use a pipette tip, and just pop the whole thing into a culture tube containing 2 ml LB media (+ antibiotic).
**(see http://openwetware.org/wiki/Bacterial_cell_culture)
*Grow on shaker at 37C overnight

==June 8==
*Pour a gel, and let this cool during step 5.  
**We can run a 1% gel.
**Weigh out 1 g agarose and add 1x TBE to a total of ~100 g.  
**Squirt in a few extra grams of distilled water to allow for evaporation.  
**Microwave until agarose is fully dissolved (try 1 minute, followed by 30 second increments.
*Qiagen miniprep kit on all samples.
**http://openwetware.org/wiki/Miniprep/Qiagen_kit
*Make glycerol stocks at this point.  (Add 50 ul cells + 50 ul 30% glycerol to 1.5 ml tube, mix by pipetting and place in -80 freezer)

*Hydrate and transform pSB1AT3 into competent cells
*Grow overnight 37Â°C

*Run samples on gel, cut out bands of proper size.  Make sure to weigh empty tubes beforehand, so we will know the weight of the band.
*Qiagen gel-extraction kit.  Quantitate on nanodrop to determine concentration. (see http://openwetware.org/wiki/Wittrup:_Gel_extraction and Qiagen manual).
*(pour a gel at this point)
*[[Knight:DNA_ligation_using_NEB_Quick_Ligation_Kit|Ligation]] (follow protocol that comes with T4 ligase, for example), with proper controls.  While ligation runs, figure out what size products you are expecting.
*Gel purification of ligated product. Same as steps 4-7.
*Transformation (same as Tuesday).

*Come in early (e.g. 8 am) and pick colonies so we can miniprep them the same day.  Grow at 37C for 6-8 hours.
**Alternatively, come in late and grow cultures overnight and then continue on Saturday
*Miniprep & nanodrop quantitation
*Gel analysis / purification
*Submit samples for sequencing.
