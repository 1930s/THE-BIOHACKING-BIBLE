*Protein engineering of antibody binding sites: Recovery of specific activity in an anti-digoxin single-chain Fv analogue produced in Escherichia coli -- Huston
:: A description of how the first scFV (single chain variable fragment) was developed.  This one binds to digoxin, and the sequence of the scFV is given; we may be able to use this as an initial test before using our scFV of choice.
