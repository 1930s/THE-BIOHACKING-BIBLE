The model explored describe a system where a compound 'A' is transformed into a compound 'B', which is consequently transformed into a compound 'C'.
 
To start, launch the CellDesigner Application: Double Click on the Icon found on your Desktop.

'''Part IV: Synthesis-Degradation Model
</font><br>
</div>


In this section, we investigate a very common motif in biochemistry. It models the continuous and constant synthesis of a compound, and its natural degradation.
From a Mathematical point of view, the model is described as a first-order linear ordinary differential equation.

* Open a NEW document. Name it 'Synthesis_Degradation_Model'.
'''Build the topology of the reaction network'''
* Create a 'Source' compound, thanks to the 'simple molecule' icon.
* The same way, create a 'A' compound.
* Create a reaction link between 'Source' and 'A', Reaction_1, using the 'state transition' icon.
* Create a 'degradation reaction' linked to 'A', Reaction_2, using the 'degradation reaction' icon.
* Save your file.
|-
| From the law of mass action, we can write: 
* <math>\frac{d[A]}{dt} = k_{1} - k_{2}*[A]</math>
| 
'''Define the kinetics driving the reaction network'''
* Edit Reaction_1, and define a new parameter k_1 = 1.0, and create the kinetic law according to the ODE system.
* Edit Reaction_2, and define a new parameter k_2 = .01, and create the kinetic law according to the ODE system.
* Save your model.

* Open Simulation Panel
* Set time for the simulation to be 1000 seconds, with 1000 points.

** Run a simulation over t=1000s, nb points=1000. Comment on the time evolution of 'A'. (illustration needed).
** Using the dynamical system definition, what is the steady state level of 'A' with regards to the parameters k1 and k2 ? (Steady state means that <math> \frac{d[A]}{dt}=0</math>
** Using the 'Parameter Scan' feature, illustrate the influence of both parameters (k_1 and k_2), on the steady state level of 'A' (illustration needed).
** '''Bonus''': Give the analytical solution of the ODE system.
** Now, consider that k_1=0, and <math>[A]_{t=0}=A_{0} > 0 </math>. Keep k_2=0.01. Illustrate the concept of half-life for the compound 'A'.
** '''Bonus''': Derive the analytical expression of the half-life of 'A', with regards to k_1 and k_2.

'''Part V: Michaelis-Menten Model'''
</font><br>
</div>


An '''enzyme''' converts a '''substrate''' into a '''product'''. An enzyme reaction constitutes a dynamic process and can be studied as such. One may look at the time courses of the reactants, or look at the steady-states and their stability properties.
This part of the tutorial deals with well-known Michaelis-Menten formula.
Here, we will focus on comparing the Michaelis-Menten approximation to the full enzymatic reaction network.

* From the ODE system description, create all the necessary kinetics reactions in the network provided. We will be considering <math> K_{1}=10^5 M^{-1} s^{-1}</math>,<math> K_{2}= 1000 s^{-1} </math>,<math> K_{3}= 10^{-1}</math>,<math> K_{4}= 2 M^{-1} s^{-1}</math>,<math> [E]_{t=0}= 0.01 M</math>,<math> [S]_{t=0}=0.01M </math>,<math> [P]_{t=0}=0</math>
* Open the Simulation Panel, set Time=100, NbPoints=1000.
* Run a simulation, and comment on the different phases during the product formation. Pay special attention to the formation of the [ES] complex.

* We want now to investigate the Michaelis-Menten approximation. Show that under the assumption that the complex [ES] is at steady-state (<math>\frac{d[ES]}{dt}=0</math>), and K_4=0, we can write: <math> \frac{d[P]}{dt}= \frac{Vmax[S]}{Km+[S]} </math>. (Note that <math> [E]_{t=0}=[E]_{t}+[ES]_{t} </math>). Also, make sure that the concentration of the substrate is at least 10 fold greater than the concentration of the enzyme.
* Express (Km and Vmax) with regards to K_1, K_2, K_3 and <math>[E]_{0}</math>
* From the expressions found above, create a new reaction in CellDesigner(as shown above). Make sure that both models are equivalent with regards to their parameters.
* Run simulations, and comment on the differences observed between to full model, and the Michaelis-Menten approximation.
