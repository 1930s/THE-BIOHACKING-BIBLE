=Module 4 Research Proposal=
Injectisome is a protein that is found on some bacteria that acts as a needle.  Because of this, bacteria wit this protein can act like bacteriophage, and can even inject matterial into mammalian cells.  This protein is thoought to fuction as a conduit for protein translocation.

==Research Idea==
Our research idea uses this protein to create a new drug delivery system.  Using the idea of systems engineering and synthetic biology, we could create a new part that produces this injectisome protein.  We could then use this part to create a cell that could produce and inject a protein.  Our idea is to study how this protein works, and test its effectiveness on mammalian cells.
