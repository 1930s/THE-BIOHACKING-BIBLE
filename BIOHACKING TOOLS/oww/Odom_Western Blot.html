==Overview==

This is the western blot protocol used in the Odom Lab. Standard protocol for use with pre-cast gels. 

==Materials==

===Sample Buffer===
* 950ul Laemmli Sample Buffer (Biorad)
* 50ul BME

===Running Buffer===
* 150ml 10X Tris/Glycine/SDS
* 1350ml water

===Transfer Buffer (10X mix, 20% methanol)===
* 200ml 10X Tris/Glycine
* 400ml methanol
* 1400ml water

===Blocking Buffer (5% milk in TBS)===
* 2.5g nonfat dry milk (5%)
* up to 50ml TBS

===Ponceau S Solution===
* Dissolve 0.5g Ponceau S in 1ml glacial acetic acid
* Bring to 100ml with water

===TBST===
* 500ul Tween-20
* 1L TBS

===Primary Wash (0.5% milk, 0.01% NaAz in TBST)===
* 0.5g nonfat dry milk
* up to 10ml in TBST
* 20ul 5% sodium azide
* primary antibody 

===Secondary Wash (5% milk in TBST)===
* 1g nonfat milk (5%)
* up to 20ml with TBST
* secondary antibodies 

==Procedure==
# Add Sample Buffer to lysate and boil at 95 for 5min.
#* ~30-100ug protein/lane
#* 2 volumes sample buffer
#* PBS can be added to add volume to lysate	
# Add Running Buffer and load gel
# Run at 60-100v for ~3 hours in the cold room
# Make transfer buffer and chill to 4
# Wet nitrocellulose membrane in ddH20 then transfer buffer for 1-15min
# Disassemble gel by pushing opening down onto lid of transfer apparatus
# Cut the stacking gel off 
# Assemble transfer apparatus
#* Sponge
#* Whatman
#* Gel
#* Nitrocellulose membrane, pre-wet
#* Whatman
#* Sponge
#* Remove all air bubbles with each new layer
#* Membrane must be on positive side, gel on negative side
# Fill tank with Transfer buffer
# Transfer for 3.5 hours at 300mA or O/N at 100mA
# Disassemble apparatus and wet membrane in TBS for 5min
# OPTIONAL:  Visualize transferred proteins with Ponceau stain
## Place membrane in Ponceau S solution for 5min at RT
## Destain in water for 2min
## Completely destain in water for additional 10mins
# Block with blocking buffer for 2 hours at RT or O/N in cold
# Wash with TBST for 15min RT
# Block with Primary Wash for 3 hours at RT or O/N in cold
# Wash in TBST 4x15min at RT
# Wash with Secondary Wash for 1 hour at RT
# Wash in TBST 4x15min at RT
# Combine luminal solutions solutions 1:1 to make 5ml and drip over the membrane
# Cover with saran wrap and let sit in dark for 3min
# Dab off excess luminal and visualize in darkroom immediately
#* 2min is good starting exposure
