== Chemical Inventory (ChemTracker) ==

We are now required by EHS to keep a detailed inventory of our laboratory chemicals (through ChemTracker).  

To access ChemTracker:
# Go to the [https://informit.mit.edu/ehs-ms/tools_inventory.html EHS-MS Tools] site and click on the "ChemTracker User Login" link (requires MIT certificates).
# Click on the "ChemTracker Application Access Page" for consortium members.
# Find the row for MIT and click on "ChemTracker V3."  This will take you back to an EHS site which will require a username (GREGSTEP) and password (GREGSTEP).  This should log you into the ChemTracker application.
