Investigation into halophilic bacteria or archaea I think is necessary because these organisms thrive in hypersaline conditions. For this reason it may be possible for them to sequester more salt from solution whilst maintaining structural integrity.

I think this project has the advantages of being a possibly feasible persuit and a great benefit to mankind if successful.

I think after the bacteria has taken up the salt from solution, they can easily be removed using a filter thereby leaving drinking water.

I think we may have to find an halophile that will not lyse in distilled water. There are many sorts of halophiles out there.
