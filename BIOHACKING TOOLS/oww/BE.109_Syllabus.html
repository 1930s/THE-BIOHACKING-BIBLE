==Layout of the class==

You will perform four series of experiments (called “modules”) over the course of the semester. The modules differ in length and in the ways you will be assessed. The experiments and your assignments are: 

{| border="1"
|-
| '''Module'''
| '''Topic'''
| '''Assignment'''
| '''% of Final Grade'''
|-

| [[BE.109:DNA engineering | DNA engineering]]

| 4
| [[BE.109:Bio-material engineering | Bio-material engineering]]
| oral presentation + written text

|}

You will be working as pairs throughout the semester, but you will be submitting individual lab reports and giving individual oral presentations. 

In addition to the assignments listed above there will be 
*'''Daily Lab Quizzes''' (5% of final grade)
**These are intended to refresh your memory about the experiment you are performing. They will not be hard and should take no more than 5 minutes at the beginning of lab.
*'''Homework Assignments''' (10% of final grade)
**These will vary considerably. You may be asked to perform a calculation, draw a conclusion, and/or make a figure using the data you have collected. 
*'''Laboratory Notebooks''' (5% of final grade)
**You will record your data on the white pages of a bound notebook. The yellow, duplicate pages will be collected and evaluated by the TA. 

Late work will be penalized 1/3 of a letter grade for each day late and will not be accepted after a week.

'''''“[We] often find an immense amount of satisfaction in the accumulation of facts but lifelong inspiration comes from a chance encounter with an event that provokes awe.” -Anthony Byers'''''

==Lab Attendance==

Lab attendance is mandatory and there are no make-up labs. A family crisis or severe illness requiring attention from the infirmary and prohibiting you from all your coursework are acceptable reasons for missing lab and every effort will be made to accommodate you in these exceptional circumstances.
