#Streak selective plate from glycerol stocks of ''E. coli'' that contain the vector plasmids and incubate overnight.  ''Plates stored at 4 &deg;C.''
#Pick colony from the plate and put in LB + antibiotic overnight.
#Spin down cells, run miniprep kit to isolate plasmid DNA. ''Plasmids stored in buffer EB at -20 &deg;C.''
#Take 1 &mu;g of plasmid DNA, digest with restriction enzymes to give sticky ends that match the insert.  ''If enzymes are heat inactivated, can store at -20 &deg;C. (?)
#Separate vector from cutout by gel electrophoresis.  ''Gel slice stored at 4 &deg;C.''
#Use gel extraction kit to recover vector. ''Vector stored in buffer EB at -20 &deg;C.''
