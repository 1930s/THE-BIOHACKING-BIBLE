Protein Prep Procedure for mbl-short<br><br>

FRESH TRANSFORMATION:<br>
•	Obtain a agarose/amp plate and let it sit at room temp<br>
•	Obtain S.O.C. and let thaw at room temp<br>
•	Thaw Rosetta Cells and plasmid on ice<br>
•	In a .5mL eppendorf tube add 50uL of chloramphenicol and 100uL of water.  Spread on plate (with beads)<br>
•	Add 2uL of plasmid into the Rosetta cells<br>
•	Mix and incubate Rosetta cells with the plasmid in them on ice for five minutes<br>
•	Heat shock the cells + plasmid at 42C for 30 seconds<br>
•	Place on ice for two minutes<br>
•	Add 250uL of  S.O.C.<br>
•	Plate anywhere from 100-200uL of cells + plasmid onto plate (Spread on plate with beads)<br>
•	Let incubate upside down at 37C overnight<br>
•	In the morning put in 4C fridge until ready to use later that day<br><br>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>


1.	Obtain 1L of LB, add 1000uL of Amp.  <br>
2.	Start a 50mL starter culture add 50ul of chloramphenicol in it, along with a colony or two from your fresh transformation.<br>
3.	Put in 37C incubator/shaker overnight<br>
4.	 The next morning →<br>
i) Pre-warm your LB/amp in 37C shaker for 30min<br>
ii) GLYCEROL STOCKS<br>
Take .5mL of 50% Glycerol and .5mL of your overnight starter culture, put in 1.5mL eppendorf tube, mix and store in -80C<br>
iii) Pour starter culture into the 1L of pre-warmed LB<br>
5.	Check absorbance every hour until it has reached 1.0 or above.  <br>
6.	Induce with IPTG so that final concentration is .4mM IPTG<br>
7.	After Protein has been induced, let it shake in a 30C incubator for 3 hours<br>
8.	Pellet Cells out by spinning them at 6000rpm for 15 minutes<br>
9.	Store pellets in a 50mL falcon tube<br>
10.	The next morning→Make 500mL of Lysis Buffer, Wash Buffer A and Wash Buffer B<br><br>

Lysis Buffer-----500mM NaCl, 25mM Tris pH 8.0, 5% Glycerol, 10mM BME<br>
Wash Buffer A--300mM NaCl, 25mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton, 5mM BME<br>
Wash Buffer B---1M NaCl, 25mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton, 5mM BME<br>
Elution Buffer----10mM reduced glutathione, 150mM NaCl, 50mM Trish pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton, 5mM BME <br>
* ADD BME WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO USE *<br>
11.	Re-suspend Pellets from yesterday in 50mL of Lysis Buffer.<br>
12.	Lyse 6 times with 15 second intervals (Make sure to keep on ice at all times)<br>
13.	Spin down for 30 minutes at 12,000rpm<br>
14.	Get two 50mL eppendorf tubes with ~ 5-10ml of beads (one for mbl-GST and the other for mbl with no GST tags)<br>
15.	Put half of your protein in one falcon tube and half of your protein in the other falcon tube<br>
16.	Shake protein in beads, and let rotate in 4C fridge for 1 hour<br>
17.	Wash both protein batches 3 times with Buffer B and 2 times with Wash Buffer A<br>
Washing means:  Put 10-25mL of Wash Buffer with protein and GST beads, mix, let rotate in 4C fridge for five minutes.   Then centrifuge ~300rcg for 2 minutes.  Take out supernatant (which is waste) and do another round of washing<br>
18.	In one 50mL falcon tube with beads and protein in it, add 10mL of Wash Buffer A (the one with less salt) and 3 tubes (30uL each) of Precision Protease.  Mix, and leave rotating at 4C overnight<br>
19.	 Elute the protein from the other falcon tube by putting in 7mL of Elution Buffer, mixing, centrifuging, collecting supernatant (save because that is where protein nis) and then add 3 more mLs of Elution Buffer, mix,, and centrifuge.  Collect supernatant and store supernatant in 4C<br>
20.	Put protein through Q Column→<br><br>
ATKA<br>
i)	Make sure that there is enough Q Column Buffers<br>
Q Column Buffer A….50mM NaCl, 10mM Tris pH 7.5, 1mM EDTA pH 7.5, 5mM BME<br>
Q Column Buffer A w/o salt…10mM Tris pH 7.5, 1mM EDTA, 5mM BME<br>
Q Column Buffer B….1M NaCl, 10mM Tris pH 7.5, 1mM EDTA pH 7.5, 5mM BME<br>
	* FILTER ALL BUFFERS BEFORE USE *<br>
	      ii)      Check to make sure the pumps are working correctly (water should be coming out of them when you open them. If not, then use the syringe to pull water out)<br>
iii)	Do the mbl-GST protein first. Filter Protein. Put mbl-GST in (which should be ~10mL) in 40mL of Q Column Buffer A w/o salt.  Mix, and put in 4C fridge<br>
iv)	Pump wash purify with lines A and B in filtered water. Do this twice<br>
v)	Pump wash purify with line A in Q Column Buffer A (with salt) and line B in Q Column Buffer B.  Do once<br>
vi)	Wash sample loop and and put in protein, filling top part with water<br>
vii)	Pick Program →I think it says MonoQ mbl and make sure you change the injection volume to be whatever you need it to be.  Nothing else was changed<br>
viii)	Enter all data (eluents and protein) and a name you can remember it as<br>
ix)	Put in clean fraction tubes and make sure everything is set<br>
x)	Click on start and let the program start<br>
xi)	Collect initial flow through and anything else you think you should collect<br>
xii)	Wait for Atka to finish then put mbl with no GST through Atka.  Spin down mbl with no GST and take supernatant. <br>
xiii)	Filter protein. Put mbl with no GST in 40mL of Q Column Buffer A w/o salt.  <br>
xiv)	Follow same procedure for mbl with GST <br><br>

21.	Concentrate Protein→ protein is at 60mM NaCl make it 300mM NaCl<br>
NITROGEN CONCENTRATOR<br>
i)	Find the right size nitrogen concentrator and rinse off<br>
ii)	Concentrate mbl-GST and mbl w/o GST separately<br>
iii)	First concentrate mbl-GST and put in a 10,000 MWCO filter.  Remember, the shiny side of filter should be facing up<br>
iv)	Put rubber ring around filter, adjust the concentrator and add protein<br>
v)	Hook up to lid and waste and waste (save waste just in case)<br>
vi)	Turn on nitrogen by turning the right knob on first (counter clockwise) and then the left most knob on (counter clockwise)<br>
vii)	Make sure pressure is not above 75 psi (usually you want to keep at 60 psi) if pressure is above adjust using middle knob<br>
viii)	Stop when amount of protein is between 1-2 ml<br>
ix)	Do the same exact thing with mbl w/o GST and make sure to clean out concentrator with water.  Use a 1000 MWCO filter<br><br>
22.	Dialyze Protein overnight→<br>
i)	Make Dialysis Buffer…500mM NaCl, 25mM Tris pH 7.5, 50% Glycerol, 5mM BME  *ADD BME RIGHT BEFORE YOU ARE READY TO DIALYZE*<br>
