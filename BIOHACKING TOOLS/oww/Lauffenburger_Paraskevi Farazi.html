Idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity accounts for more than 10% of acute liver failure cases in adverse drug effects and represents a major problem in the pharmaceutical industry. I am interested in investigating, both experimentally and computationally, the signaling networks involved in idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity. To this end, I would like to study the toxicity phenotypes and intracellular signaling of human hepatoma cell lines and primary rat/human hepatocytes in response to a range of cytokines and drugs known to cause idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity in humans. The ultimate goal is to develop a computational model that is able to correlate intracellular signaling measurements with cytotoxic phenotypes.
