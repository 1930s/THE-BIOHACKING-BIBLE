==The main goal is to provide all the information necessary for someone else to repeat your experiment '''and obtain similar results'''==
===Schematics of how to hook up the instruments===
===Product numbers and manufacturers / lot numbers if perishable material===
===Description of experimental technique (how did you twist the dial; what were criteria for "center of spectral line" or "starting / stopping stopwatch?" or "pumping the oil droplets")===
===Pictures of instruments great -- you can use PowerPoint or something to add arrows and text to these photos if you want===
