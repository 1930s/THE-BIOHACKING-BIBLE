Every group runs lab meetings differently.  I know that in the [[Endy Lab|Endy lab]], we occasionally toss around ideas for improving our lab meetings or on changing the format.  It would be great to know how other labs conduct their meetings, as a source of new ideas.  Thought this page could serve as a clearinghouse for ideas on lab meeting formats, etc.
