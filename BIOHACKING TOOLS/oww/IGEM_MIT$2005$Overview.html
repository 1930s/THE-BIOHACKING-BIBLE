Two-Component Signal Transduction - most prokaryotic signal-transduction system and few eukaryotic pathways fall into this category

Basic steps
# autophosphorylation: HK-His + ATP <=> HK-His-P +ADP
# phosphotransfer: HK-His-P + RR-Asp <=> HK-His + RR-ASP-P
# dephosphorylation: RR-Asp-P + H20 <=> RR-Asp + Pi

-Starts with histidine protein kinase (HK)
   HK sense environmental stimuli and autophosphorylates at it's histidine residue
   HK has kinase core 
   Environmental stimuli sensing mechnism not very well characterized
   N-terminal of HK is sensing domain
   Sensing domain is connected to cytoplasmic kinase core through 
   transmembrane helix and a cytoplasmic linker
-HK transfers phosphate to aspartate residue on response regulator (RR)
   RR catalyzes phosphoryl transfer from HK
   Phosphorylation results in confomational change in RR and effects response
   RR also also catalyze autodephosphoylation
   RR has 2 domains: N-terminal regulatory domain and a C-terminal effector domain (DNA binding)
