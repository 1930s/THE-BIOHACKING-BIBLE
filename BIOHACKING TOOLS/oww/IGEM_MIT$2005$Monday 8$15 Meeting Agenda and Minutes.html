==General Updates==
*Kate: Are we coming into your lab today to do more cleaning? When are you around?
**yes, you have a few things left to do (maybe 20 minutes?)....I'm leaving around 3:45 PM.--Kate
*Team: Info on the Endy lab space:
*#Jen will show those who weren't around Friday afternoon where our materials are
*#Heather needs to do some lab specific safety training with <b>everyone</b>, ASAP. We'll do it after this meeting, if we can.
*I may be late, though hopefully not absent, for today's meeting. With apologies, Natalie

==SubTeam Updates==

Format: what is the progress? what are the issues?

===Input: Maxine===
No updates.

===Receiver Head-Unit: Jen M===
*Taking over for Jenny, unless someone else volunteers to. 
*This week: 
*#Complete construction of scFv test construct
*#Begin testing
*#*expression (cytoplasmic): western blotting. Any favorite protocols? To plan: talk to team mates and lab members. Timescale?
*#*fluorescein binding: need help designing an experiment. should have done by end of week.
