*Prioritize RS# - How to quantify the criteria below?
**Disease relevance 
***Number of PMID's
***Number of drugs for particular disease 
***Disease lists from WHO - cross ref with pubmed
***CDC
***Keywords in disease classification
****Mesh terms - Deniz
****Keywords from OMIM - Resmi
***California excel table - frequency of diagnosis - Zach
***Clustering algorithm (on the side) - Kay
**Frequency of deleterious allele
***[http://www.genecards.org/index.shtml GeneCards]
***Clustering alleles with respect to genes and particular diseases
**Treatment
***[http://www.emedicine.com/ Emedicine] - Tiff
***Known drugs, devices, patents, total dolars spent
***WHO - Hetmann and Cynthia
****Curable
****Treatable 
****Preventable
**Known alleles
**Penetrance
***WIKI brainstorm - HapMap?? OMIM?
*Web interface
**Not just script also paste in sequence - Xiaodi
**Maybe useful source for getting sequence data
*Non OMIM based analysis of sequences - Chris
**SNPdb?
*Presentation of Information
**Review articles 
***use PMID's for related review articles - Resmi
***Beyond PubMed: Google scholar
**News
***Beyond Google News, restricting to certain sites
**Social Network?
