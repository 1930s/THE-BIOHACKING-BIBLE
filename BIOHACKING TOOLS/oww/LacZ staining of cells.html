{{back to protocols}}

The bacterial enzyme &beta;-galactosidase (gene LacZ) is frequently used as reporter gene. It can be easily located with a LacZ stain using the artificial substrate X-gal.

This protocol can be used for staining cultured cells containing active LacZ genes.

== material ==

* X-gal stock is 200 mg/ml in dimethylformamide (DMF)			
			
* K ferri-cyanide ( 50mM ) =Fe<sup>3-</sup> is 0,33 g / 20 ml PBS ( Sigma Cat.# P-8131)
* K ferro-cyanide ( 50mM ) =Fe<sup>4-</sup> is 0,42 g / 20 ml PBS ( Sigma Cat.# P-9387)

=== staining solution ===

* make fresh
* heat mix to 50°C before adding X-Gal, in order to avoid precipitation

== common mistakes / tips ==

* time of fixation is crucial; overfixing cells will reduce LacZ activity
* some cell types are easy to detach by squirting liquid onto the dish; be careful;
* X-Gal will precipitate if solution cools too much

== steps ==

# carefully wash cells once with PBS (avoid detaching cells by strong pipetting)		
<pre>
(volume is around 5 ml for 10 cm-dish
                  3 ml for 6 cm-dish			
                 500µl for a 24 well)		
</pre>	
# add fixative solution
# incubate 2 min (Time is important !)			
# carefully wash 3 times with PBS (1st wash must be quick to avoid overfixation in the last samples to be washed)	
# add staining solution
# incubate over night at 37°C
