We are mixing oil and water - a very old problem...
* The problem arises due to a high surface tension at the interface.
* The creation of surfaces requires an energy input - ''work''.
* The lowest energy state is that with smallest interface surface area.

Surfactants are used to reduce surface tension.

A surfactant is any substance that reduces the surface tension between two immiscible liquids.

The activity of surfactants depends on:
* Oil composition
* Salinity and osmolarity 
* pH, temperature, pressure
* Head and tail characteristics
* etc.

We have used different materials:
* ''DOPC, POPC, and Span 80 as surfactants''
* ''Dodecane and Mineral Oil as oils''


We have done modifications to our protocol, often in an expedient manner.
* ''Sometimes haphazard, sometimes serendipitous.''

* Vesicles are inefficient without permeability.
* Pores do not destabilize the membrane, but they are toxic.
* Detergents are not toxic, but they destabilize the membrane.
