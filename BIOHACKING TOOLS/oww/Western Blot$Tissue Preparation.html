==Overview==

This is a protocol for preparing whole cell lysate from tissue, for western blot analysis.

==Materials==

===RIPA Buffer===
per 100ml: (final concentration)
* 5ml of 1M Hepes, pH 7.6 (50 mM)
* 200µL of 0.5M EDTA (1 mM)
* 7 ml of 10% DOC (Na deoxycholate) (0.7%)
* 10 ml of 10% NP-40 (IPGEL) (1%)
* 10 ml of 5M LiCl or 2.12g powder (0.5 M)

===Protease inhibitors===
* For example, Complete tabs from Roche [http://www.roche-applied-science.com/PROD_INF/BIOCHEMI/No1_99/pgs21-22.pdf]
* Or [http://www.biocompare.com/matrix/3222/Protease-Inhibitor-Cocktails.html]


==Procedure==
# Weigh tissue.
# Dice into very small pieces using a clean razor blade. 
# Add 3 ml of ice cold RIPA buffer (supplemented with protease inhibitors) per gram of tissue.
# Further disrupt and homogenize tissue with a dounce homogenizer or a sonicator. Maintain temperature at 4° C throughout all procedures. 
# Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
# Transfer to microcentrifuge tubes, centrifuge at 10,000xg for 10 minutes at 4° C. 
# Remove supernatant and centrifuge again. The super-natant fluid is the total cell lysate. 

==Notes==
* If necessary, use a longer centrifugation to obtain a clear lysate.
