==Publishing via DSpace==

We are in the process of creating a [[DSpace community | community on DSpace]] through which we can publish digital materials.

==Why should scientific publications be open access?== 

Some of the more compelling reasons. (This is by no means complete so feel free to add to it).

''Note: many of these reasons are based on talks I've heard by [http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1993/roberts-autobio.html Rich Roberts] ([http://www.neb.com NEB]), [http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/moin/PeterMurrayRust Peter Murray-Rust] and [http://www.swiss.csail.mit.edu/~hal/hal.html Hal Abelson] ([http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/270/ video]).  -[[User:Rshetty|Reshma]]'' 

# At least in the United States, most scientific research is funded entirely or partially with federal tax dollars.  So if tax payers are paying for scientific research, shouldn't they be able to access the results of that research?
# Since journals are increasingly coming under monopoly control by a handful of publishers, they are able to price journal subscriptions very high.  So high that university libraries are unable to afford subscriptions to all the journals that university researchers need.  This in turn poses a problem for scientists trying to access previously published research.  Effectively this situation creates a rich-poor gap for scientific information. <br> ''Note: For relatively rich institutions like MIT, this poses a relatively minor problem.  Despite rising costs, the MIT libraries still provide access to most of the journals the university resarch community requires (in my experience).  For scientists at other research institutions, this is often not the case.  For example, at the University of Utah, there were times that I was unable to access a copy of a relevant paper because no library in the state carried either a paper or electronic copy of the article.  My impression is that this is a phenomenon that many people at the "elite" institutions don't realize.  Keep in mind that the University of Utah is a pretty prominent U.S. research institution with lots of very well-respected scientists but yet grapples with this problem.  I would imagine that the situation can be much worse at poorer universities and research institutions. -[[User:Rshetty|Reshma]]''
# Scientists provide their work to journals for free.  Depending on the journal, publication in the journal means giving up all or part of the rights to your own scientific work and writing forever (or close to it).
# Quality science requires that scientists have access to each other's results for purposes of review and replication of experiments.  Moreover, science has at its heart the goal of eduation.  Both of these require that people actually be able to read previous work.
# Dissemination of information via the web has become ridiculously easy.  Now that it is feasible to make scientific information accessible to all, we have a reponsibility to do so.
# Scientists are generally smart people.  If any group of people can find a way out of this mess, shouldn't we be able to? 
# Many studies show that open access articles are cited more and have higher impact.
# It's the right thing to do.
