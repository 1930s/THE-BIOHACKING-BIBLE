==Purification of the Digested Fragment and Vector==
*Fragment: crRNA(J23078); Vector: R0040.
*Use PCR Purification Kit. 
*The volume of purified fragment and vector: each 30uL, respectively.

==Electorphoresis==
*To check the yield of the purified fragment and vector.
*2% agarose.(For the ~70bp crRNA)
*Each sample: 2uL; with 1uL 10*loading buffer and 1uL 200* DNA dye added, respectively.
*From left to right: crRNA_PstI+XbaI, R0040_PstI+SpeI, R0040 plasmid, Marker I.

==Ligation==
*Ligate the crRNA fragment and R0040 vector.
*crRNA 2uL, R0040 4uL, totally 10uL system.
*system without crRNA added as a negative control.
*4 centigrade degree, overday.
*Then transform them.
