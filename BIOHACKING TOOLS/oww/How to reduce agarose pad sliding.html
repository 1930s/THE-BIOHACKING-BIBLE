Please feel free to edit if you have other tricks.

== Tried ==
* Press the pad with finger or with the wide end of a pipette tip (e.g. 1000ml tip)
: Helps, but I still get sliding, especially at high temp (>=40C) --[[User:Stpierre|FSP]] 23:14, 8 Jun 2005 (EDT) 

* Use a bigger pad; try to fit it exactly on the glassy part of the dish

* Others?

== Not tried yet==

* Dry the pad for longer before using it. I typically dry it for 45min.
** If I want to do really really nice microscopy I make sure I leave it for at least one hour [[User:BrunoAfonso|bruno afonso]] Aug 14 2006

* Use a pad with a higher percentage of agarose. By the way, why are we using agarose, and why low-melting point agarose in particular?
** I've once tried regular agarose and it didn't work out that well for me. didn't even tried to image with it :) . See also [[http://freegardens.net/wiki/Fluorescent_Microscopy]] [[User:BrunoAfonso|bruno afonso]] Aug 14 2006
