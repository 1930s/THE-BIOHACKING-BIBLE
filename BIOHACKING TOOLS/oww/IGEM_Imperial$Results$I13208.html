===Aims===

The aim of this experiment was to test the Zinc Hypothesis. That is whether Zinc ions are required for AiiA Activity.

===Extra Information===

*The cultures were innoculated with a final AHL concentration of 5nM
*The I13208 were grown in the prescence of AHL for 2 hours
*The T9002 assays were assessed after a period of 2 hours
*Although a T9002 control for M9 was ommitted, previous experiments suggest a GFP/OD reading of 9500 for 0 AHL and 22000 for 5nM AHL after 3.5 hours
*Previous experiments also suggest a GFP/OD reading of 87000 for 5nM AHL when in LB culture after 3.5 hours.

===Results===

*Data File:

===Comments===

*The experimental data gave unexpected results
**The Flourescence/OD490 for both LB cultures was below that of the T9002 control
**Only the -/Zn of the M9 cultures showed a significantly lower level of GFP/OD than the rest, this is unexpected

===Conclusions===

*No significant conclusion can be drawn from this experiment
*It should be repeated
*Controls using I13208 cells not in the prescence of AHL should be used
*Controls of T9002 in M9 should also be used
