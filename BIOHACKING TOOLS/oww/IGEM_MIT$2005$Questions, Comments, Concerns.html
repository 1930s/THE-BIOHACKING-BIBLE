Yes yes, please please more organization, and more teamwork!  I would like to see us come together as a team more, and try to figure out how best to plan better to take advantage the fact that there are many brilliant minds all working on this project.  If we can find a good way to work together, we can accomplish a lot!!

Hey team--just checking in to see that everyone is doing ok.   I'd definitely recommend setting up the briefing with Kit Parker from Harvard--sounds like a little group organization could be really helpful and will (MAY?) keep heads from exploding.  I'm working on the list of lab supplies to order today/tomorrow--will get it to Isadora for ordering on Monday.  Looking forward to hearing about the project tomorrow at "briefing."  -KBS
