=== Follow this protocol if the transfected cells are to be passed on fibronectin-coated dish one day before imaging.===
* Commercial fibronectin (bFn) has a concentration of 1mg/ml. They need to be diluted 50 times with water to 20ug/ml.
* Put uncovered dish with fibronectin (150ul/dish) in incubator overnight. Evenly spread the liquid in the well using pipette tip.
* During passing the cells (right after centrifugation step), pipette out the excess liquid.
* Pass the cells to the fibronectin covered  dishes.

NOTE: The above protocol is for MEF cells.
