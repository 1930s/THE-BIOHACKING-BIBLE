Isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside

Induces transcription from promoters regulated by lacI repressor.

Molecular weight is 238.31 g/mol.  The chemical formula is [http://www.fermentas.com/catalog/reagents/img/iptg.gif here].

#Dissolve 1g in 4196 &mu;L deionized water to make 1M solution.
#Filter sterilize with syringe and 0.22&mu;m filter

Generally a 1mM solution is an effective amount to induce the pLac promoter region.  It should be noted that this may vary over cell strains.  For example: 
*lacIq: cell strains which overproduce lacI repressor (ie. [[E. coli genotypes|E.coli cell strain]] type [[E. coli genotypes#D1210|D1210]], aka. [[registry:Part:BBa_V1003|BBa_V1003]])
