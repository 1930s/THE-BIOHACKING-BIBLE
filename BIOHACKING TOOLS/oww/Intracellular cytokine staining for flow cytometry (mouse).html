==Overview==

Staining for intracellular cytokines, followed by flow cytometry analysis, can provide single-cell information about a cell population that one cannot obtain from surface staining or [[ELISA]] (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay).  

==Materials==

===Supplies===
*96-well V-bottom plate
*12 x 75mm Falcon round-bottom tubes

===Reagents===
*DMEM-10
**1L DMEM (with 4.5g/L glucose, L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate; from Mediatech, catalog#  10-013-CM)
**100mL fetal bovine/calf serum
**10mL 100x PSG (penicillin G sodium, streptomycin sulfate, L-glutamine; from Gibco, catalog# 10378-016)
**10mL HEPES buffer solution (1M)
**10mL non-essential amino acids solution (10mM, 100X; Gibco catalog# 11140)
**1mL 2-mercaptoethanol (1000X)
***sterilize using 0.2&mu;m filter; store at 4&deg;
*stimulation solution
**5mL complete DMEM
**2.5&mu;L of 200µg/ml PMA (phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate)
**1.35&mu;L of 10mM ionomycin 
**20&mu;L of 10mg/ml brefeldin A
***chemicals will stick to plastic; make just before use, and discard solution afterwards
*FACS buffer
**97mL PBS (phosphate buffered solution)
**3% fetal bovine/calf serum (i.e. 3mL)
**0.1% sodium azide (i.e. 100&mu;L; optional, especially if you do not plan to store the buffer after use)
*PBS (phosphate buffer solution)
*BD Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (or 4X eBioscience permeabilization solution and eBioscience permeabilization diluent)
*BD Perm/Wash buffer (or 10X eBioscience permeabilization buffer)
*antibodies
**Fc block (2.4G2)
**fluorochrome-linked surface markers (e.g. CD3e, CD4, CD8)
**fluorochrome-linked cytokine antibodies (e.g. IFN-gamma, IL-12)

===Equipment===
*P200 pipette
*P200 or P300 multichannel pipette (optional)
*flow cytometer

==Procedure==
#Dilute single-cell suspensions to 10x10^6 cells/mL in complete DMEM.
#Add 100µl cells per well (do not forget to make wells for your staining controls).
#Add 100µl stimulation mix (final concentrations: PMA = 50 ng/ml, ionomycin = 1µg/ml, brefeldin A = 10µg/ml)
#Incubate 37° for 4 hours.
#Spin plate at 800 x ''g'', 3 minutes, at 4&deg;.
#Wash 3 times with cold PBS, spinning as in step 5.
#Resuspend in 100µl Fc block (recommended dilution: 1:1000 in FACS buffer). Incubate on ice, 10 minutes. Spin.
#Resuspend in 100µl surface antibody mixture (recommend dilution: 1:200 in FACS buffer).  Incubate on ice, 20 minutes in the dark. Spin.
#Wash once with cold PBS.
#*Note: for steps 10 through 13, either use all of BD reagents or all of eBioscience reagents.  Do not mix-and-match.
#Resuspend in 200µl of either BD Cytofix/CytoPerm solution OR 1X eBioscience permeabilization solution. Incubate on ice, 30 minutes in the dark. Spin 1500 x ''g'', 5 minutes, 4&deg;.
#Wash once with 200µl either BD Perm/Wash buffer OR 1X eBioscience permeabilization buffer. Spin as in step 10.
#Resuspend in 100µl cytokine stain (recommended dilution: 1:100 in 1X Perm/Wash OR permeabilisation buffer). Incubate on ice, 30 minutes in the dark. Spin as in step 10.
#Wash twice with BD Perm/Wash OR eBioscience permeabilization buffer, spinning as in step 10.
#Resuspend cells in 100-200µl FACS buffer and transfer to Falcon round-bottom tubes for acquisition on a flow cytometer.

==Notes==
*If you make the FACS buffer fresh every time, there is no need to add sodium azide to the buffer.
*All antibody concentrations here are only recommendations.  You should titrate the antibody concentrations for your specific cell populations.
*Non-commercial reagents can also be used for this protocol.  See Current Protocols, Unit 6.24 <cite>CP6</cite>.
*As you are permeabilizing the cells through this protocol, the cells are not viable.  You cannot sort your cells based on intracellular staining.
