'''Results from Yesterday'''

Obtained the following streaked plates from the Registry:

J45320

J45200

J45120

J45700

J45250

J45999 (IK cells)

J45400*

*J45400 did not grow up.  Apparently, the 1AT3 version was incorrect.  I have requested to use the 3K3 version that was used in previous construction steps.

I will make a liquid culture of each of these today.  I will also streak them out on multiple antibiotics to see if any of them have multiple resistances.

'''J45180'''

Apparently, we never actually had a glycerol of this part.  Austin plated back in October/November, so I thought it may be in our 4 degree fridge.  However, I was unable to locate it in there.  I plan to make a transformation into top ten cells of this part today.  Reshma found a two-month-old plate with top 10 cells containing the part streaked on it.  I streaked a single colony and multiple colonies onto two plates.  I also made LCs from both one colony and many colonies in an attempt to revive the cells.

''Transformation of J45180 into Top10''

*1 vial of Top10 competent cells from Knight Lab is on the bench (dry ice) [there's another in the -80] 

'''Jason's Parts'''

Yesterday, I streaked each of Jason's hopeful banana parts (IAGD + BSGD) on LB AMP/TET, LB AMP/KAN, and LB AMP/CHL.  However, none of these grew.  I will redo this experiment today with positive controls and plain LB AMP plates.

'''Plan for the Month'''

I will work on developing a plan for the month to discuss at the meeting tomorrow.
