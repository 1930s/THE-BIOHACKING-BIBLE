* design neural networks with computations achieved by single stationary state of the '''entire''' reaction
* '''REFERENCES 1-14:''' different computational systems including digital computer, Fredkin logic gates, billiard ball collisions, cellular automata, etc.
* "All living entities process information to varying degrees, and this can occur only by chemical means."
* (17-18) chemical mechanisms similar to electronics
* propose chemical reaction network that is hardware implementation of neural network
* (15-16) coupling bistable 'flip-flop' reactions, can build universal automata
* (19) - neural networks as a computational system
* (11-13) - neural networks basis collective computational systems: feedforward networks, Hopfield's networks
* propose a set of reactions that have two states, depending on the concentration of an input catalyst
** implementation wise, to create two chemical neurons and couple them, they would need to have two independent reaction systems that obeyed the same kinetics
** need n independent reaction systems to have n neurons
*** seems very unlikely
* neurons communicate through activation or inhibition of another neurons catalyst that controls the state
* system of 4 chemical reactions - write down simple ODE's for kinetics
** conc of species A determines state of the neuron
** conservation constraint A_i + B_i = A_o
** conc of A and B evolve into a steady state determined by concentration of C - the chemical input parameter for the neuron
*** tune the gain of the neuron (sharpness of the jump) with rate constants k_2 and k_3
* when couple, effect of other neurons on neuron i is encoded in C_i
** A_i and B_i can inhibit or activate production of C_j - couple neurons this way
*** C_i can actually be the sum of many chemical entities
* goes through constructing logic gates out of neuron i, which operates on signals from neurons j and k
** AND - j and k activate C_i
** OR - ja and k activate C_i, but strongly
** A_j AND NOT A_k - j activates, k inhibits
** A_j NOR A_k - both inhibit
** plug in constants in the steady state concentration of C_i equation 6 to figure out if neuron i will fire
* autonomously oscillating catalyst can act as a clock
** all neurons updated at the same time based on current states before an impulse
* in this architecture, 4*(N+1) distinct chemical species required for N neurons
** each connection requires another distinct species
** compartmentalization would reduce the number of species required
* universal Turing machine - can do with clocked neural network of finite size and 2 infinite stacks
