== Brief Project Overview ==

We plan to develop and use genetically modified phage (M13 or other, if found more appropriate) as a source of environmental bioremediation to catabolically degrade hydrocarbons in areas devastated by oil spills.

== Background Information ==

Finding sustainable and eco-friendly solutions to clean up contaminated environments has become increasingly important as we learn more and more about the harmful costs of degrading our habitats. 
Harnessing and manipulating the varied and inherent capabilities of living organisms to help in recovery efforts is a natural step towards achieving this sustainability. 

Researchers have recently found a way to use synthetic biological design to re-engineer the T7 phage so that it is capable of degrading a variety of harmful biofilms. The authors of the paper note that their approach can be easily exploited to target other substances and other types of bacteria as well.

Using the principles behind their work, we would like to identify an enzyme or nitrate producing gene that can be incorporated into phage that are endogenous to marine environments to aid in the remediation of oil spills and leaks.

==Statement of Research Problem & Goals==

Current methods of bioremediation in oil spills often requires the introduction of exogenous bacteria, which an upset the balance of delicate marine microcosms. We plan to modify a phage that is endogenous to the environment it is in, so that is then able to infect its normal hosts, enabling them to produce compounds such as nitrates, sulfates, and ferric irons to bio-degrade hydrocarbons. The use of phage, as opposed to widespread dumping of these substances in affected areas, is self sustaining, less severe on the environment, and facilitates efforts in areas that may be unaccessible to prolonged human activity. We will also carefully monitor any side-effects of introducing the re-engineered phage to experimental microcosms.
