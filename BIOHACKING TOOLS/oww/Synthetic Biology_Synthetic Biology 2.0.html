The Second International Conference on Synthetic Biology (SB2.0) will take place on May 20-22, 2006, at the University of California, Berkeley. The conference will bring together a diverse group of participants from a variety of disciplines, including some of the worldâ€™s leaders in biological engineering, biochemistry, quantitative biology, biophysics, molecular and cellular biology, bioethics, policy and governance, and the biotech industry. A collaborative effort among Berkeley Lab, MIT, UC Berkeley, and UCSF, the conference will promote and guide the further, constructive development of the field.  

SB2.0 will begin with two days of plenary talks and discussions focused on five research areas: energy, chemistry, health, materials, and foundational technologies. The [[Synthetic Biology:SB2.0/Day 3|third day of the conference]] will be dedicated to presentation, discussion, and deliberation of the four key societal issues associated with synthetic biology: biosecurity & risk, public understanding & perception, ownership, sharing & innovation, and community organization.  All conferees will be expected to participate in these conversations.
