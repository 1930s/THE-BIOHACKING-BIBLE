== Research Interests ==
<blockquote> 
My work involves the creation of new molecular tools and analyses which enable the metabolic engineering of microorganisms. For my Ph.D. thesis, I'm focusing on the production of two model pathways (for tyrosine and lycopene biosynthesis), and exploring new ways to control and optimize gene expression for increased productivity.
