==New computer registration==
Two things need to be done when a new computer arrives in the lab, and requires network access: 
* Registration with DSM ICT to gain unique DSM ID number for support calls, and inventory. Contact DSM ICT, below.
* Registration for use on the campus local area network (LAN), and off-campus internet access. This can be done online via the Otago ITS website, and requires providing an appropriate account code for charging of billable network traffic i.e. off-campus inward and outward traffic. See Aaron for help.

Different conditions apply if the new computer is university-owned or not, e.g. a personal laptop. Personal laptops are more limited with regard to University site-licensed software that can be installed; check with DSM ICT for details. Further, DSM ICT will screen the personal laptop to make sure it is as secure as possible before unleashing it on an unsuspecting LAN.

==Network port activation==
* The Department pays for the monthly charge for each active network outlet (and we pay for the machine-specific traffic). Contact the Department Manager to initiate this request; requires port number, building, and room number.

===ICT Support===
From the DSM ICTSG [http://dnmeds.otago.ac.nz/departments/deans/ictsg/index.html website]: 

All requests for IT support in the Dunedin School of Medicine should be handled in the following way (Some research units may have alternative arrangements):
* During Office hours (8.30am - 5.00pm)
**Email dsm.it@otago.ac.nz (Preferred contact method)
**Ring the ICT Support Group on the university extension 4137 (39 4137 from ODHB)
**Leave a message if you get the Voicemail
*If it is URGENT and you have not contacted anyone or have had no response, then contact your departmental administrator. They will be able to help track one of us down.
*If you are still desperate then ring John Kaiser on 021 1422 920.
*After Hours: The University ITS HelpDesk has longer hours depending on student demand. Try 8888 or helpdesk@otago.ac.nz.

==Internet use and costs==
As an externally-funded research group we pay for all our billable network traffic i.e. off-campus, inward and outward. This warning from the DSM ICT Support Group about internet use applies to us, [http://openwetware.org/images/8/8b/DSM_internet_charges.pdf link (PDF)], but the short story is:
#Don't download music and movies (we pay for the network bandwidth).
#Don't play music and movies from the internet - this counts as (1), above (unless work related e.g. online presentations).
#No BitTorrent or other P2P filesharing apps for music and movies.
#Do not install any software without talking to the sysadmin first e.g. Skype.
#Don't fill up the HDD with anything from (1) or (2) above, MP3s you've ripped, or anything you care about - it will be deleted after you've gone.
#Don't store MP3's or movies on DSMX1. Store you personal music etc. on your local machine only.
#Don't print rubbish - B&W or colour (we pay for that too).

==File and data storage==
*Keep all data in the "DGG_data" folder in the "Developmental Genetics Group" folder on DSMX1, the Med School file server.
*Don't secret your data away in your home directory on DSMX1, or on your own computer: it makes it difficult, if not practically impossible, for others to find data generated by lab members when they move on.
*For binary data files that go on DSMX1 e.g. excel files, ABI SDS files, images, we have a hierarchical folder-naming structure inside the "DGG_data" folder that relates to the type of experiment: DGG_data->method->tissue->user->date->files (you can argue this one till blue in the face; at the end of the day we've decided on a system, and need to stick too it to make it at all useful, AJ).
*File-naming is another can of worms. At minimum, start with the date in YYYY-MM-DD format followed by an underscore then your intitials or name e.g., 2006-12-07_AJ_blah-blah.xls. Please do not use spaces in folder or file names - use an underscore or dash instead. 
*Create a plain text file inside each folder you create that describes the contents of the folder i.e what experiment, lab book page references etc. We haven't decided on a standardised way of doing this yet, but anything is better than nothing.
*Don't store non-work stuff on DSMX1 e.g., MP3's, movies. Store you personal music etc. on your local machine only.
