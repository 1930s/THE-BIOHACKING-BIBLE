===Update===
It looks like the plan is pizza.  Jason plans to order pizzas for delivery from Papa John's.  Right now his plan is to order:

*1 veggie
*3 cheese
*2 pepperoni
*1 green peppers and grilled chicken

We are expecting about 16 people (probably 12 of us and 4 of them).  Is this enough pizza?  Any requests on different types of pizza?  If not, the above is what we'll get.

Please comment soon so I can get the information to him before he orders in advance.

*Can we turn one of the cheese into a veggie, or maybe a mushroom?  [[User:Tsbayer|Tsbayer]]
*This would be awesome because I have been wanting to see actually see one of these pizzas after seeing the box by the mailboxes - the 36" Big Papa pizza from Mama's and Papa's.  The thing is enormous (so I hear).  I'm ok with Papa John's, I just felt like mentioning the big pizza.[[User:andrewb|Andrew]]




Lunch with the Miscellaneous group will be Wednesday, September 13th at noon.  Please RSVP by Sunday night.


*Where is lunch from?  Are we going out or ordering in? [[User:Tsbayer|Tsbayer]]
**Probably ordering in unless people really want to go out.  It seems to work better that way for large groups.  Suggestions are welcome! [[User:Arwbrown|Arwen]]

===I'll be there! I'm hungry already . . .===
