==Announcements==
'''November 27, 2007'''
*Heejin's MATLAB scripts for calculating [[Media:getMSD_BE309.m|MSD]] and [[Media:getGstar_Mason_BE309.m|G*]]
*If you are using SimpleTracker, use the commands: 
<code>
dlmwrite('subtracted_traj_sum30.txt',1E6*[differentialTrajectoryX;differentialTrajectoryY]','\t')

GetMSD_BE309

GetGstar_Mason_BE309
</code>

to compute G(&omega;)

'''November 20, 2007'''
*You may find this [[Media:MicroRheologyTutorial.pdf|microrheology tutorial]] useful. But, then again, you may not.
*A limited number (2) of optical traps will be set up on Monday. With a little luck, all 6 will be set up by Friday.

'''November 6, 2007'''
*Here's a [[Media:microscope.ppt | link]] to the presentation on microscope design that Lissa gave.
*And here are the [[20.309:assembly|fancy pictures]] that Sergio presented.
*Here is the best piece of advice you will receive on [[Media:20.309f06mod3.pdf|Lab Module 3]]: design your microscope before you begin constructing it! 
*It is ''strongly recommended'' that you:
#prepare a decent sketch of your design; and 
#run it by Heejin or Jae Won before you begin construction.
*Heejin and/or Jae Won will be in the lab Tuesday from 3:30-5:30, Wednesday from 3:00-6:00, Thursday from 1:00-6:00, and Friday 1:00-5:00
*Access the course locker from Athena terminals by typing: <code>attach 20.309; cd /mit/20.309/Students</code> or use [http://itinfo.mit.edu/product.php?name=securefx&platform=Windows SecureFX] from a non-Athena computer.

== Old Announcements ==
'''Dec. 1:''' If you are having trouble opening the bead movies on your home computer and need a codec, it can be downloaded from the [http://www.leadcodecs.com/Download/eval.htm LEAD Multimedia Website].  Select the LEAD MCMP/MJPEG Video Codec on the left column and install with the evaulation version.

'''Nov. 28:'''
Heejin has provided a solution set for the PMT assignment, as well as a MATLAB script for summing multiple frames for bead tracking.

'''Nov. 20:''' New materials posted today include the Image Processing Solutions, MATLAB files for calculating  MSD and G*, and three papers on the optical properties of peacock feathers.  All are accessible from the [[20.309:Schedule|Schedule]] page.

'''Nov. 7:''' The [[Media:20.309f06mod3.pdf|Fluorescence Microscope lab manual]] is online.

'''Oct. 30:''' [[Media:HW3.5.pdf|The PMT lab/homework handout]] has been posted (see [[20.309:Schedule|Schedule]] page).  It is another hybrid lab/HW set and will be weighted as half a homework, since it is very short.

'''Oct. 26:''' Helpful readings on Image Processing and the slides from Prof. So's lectures are posted on the Schedule Page (see Week 7).  In addition, the [[20.309:Presentations|Presentations]] Page now has a large selection of papers to choose from for those who have not yet presented.

'''Oct. 24:''' Lab report guidelines and grading rubric are posted on the [[20.309:Overview|General Info]] Page.  The Lab/Homework on [[Media:HW3.pdf|Image Processing]] is posted. 

'''Oct. 16:''' A Lab Exercise on [[Media:20309mod2.5.pdf|Sampling and Aliasing]] has been posted, doing which should help with doing some of the AFM experiments.

'''Oct. 1:''' [[Media:20309f06mod2.pdf|Lab Module 2: The Atomic Force Microscope]] is now available.  It covers three weeks, and is of a rather large size.  It's highly advisable to start reading through it early.

'''Sep. 26:''' Solutions to Homework Set #1 have been posted.

'''Sep. 18:''' [[Media:20.309mod1.pdf|Lab Module 1: Measuring DNA Melting Curves]] has been posted. Please aim to finish the circuit construction and most of the optics assembly by Sep. 22, so that you can spend most of the week of Sep. 25 running melting curves and optimizing your setup.

'''Sep. 13:''' Marcio has posted MATLAB tutorial files [[Media:MatlabIntro.pdf|one]] and [[Media:MatlabtutorialV2.pdf|two]] (also available  on the [[20.309:Schedule|Schedule]] page).

'''Sep. 11:''' Pizza Dinner, 6 pm Monday at the 4th floor Stata faculty lunch room.  The Stata Pub will be the alternate location.

[[Media:HW1.pdf|''HOMEWORK SET 1'']] has been posted on the [[20.309:Schedule|Schedule]] page, and will be due on Friday, Sep. 22 at 12:00 noon.

'''Sep. 8:''' Lab orientation sessions will take place ''Friday, Sep. 8 from 3pm to 4pm'' and ''Monday, Sep. 11 from 9:30am to 10:30am.'' Attendance at '' either one'' of these is mandatory for all enrolled.  Please also read over the [[Media:309LabHandout.pdf|Laboratory Guidelines Document]].

'''Sep. 6:''' All students who intend to enroll should email a ''brief'' statement of your interest (a few paragraphs) to Prof. Scott Manalis scottm AT media DOT mit DOT edu by 5:00pm on Thursday Sep. 7.  You should mention your background and (research) interests, any relevant prior coursework in mechanics, electronics, or optics, why you're interested in 20.309, and what you hope to get out of it.

'''Aug. 30:''' The lab schedule this semester will be open-format, meaning that there will be very few fixed lab hours.  The lab will be open 9am to 5pm and students will [[20.309:Lab Signup| sign up]] for the lab hours that work for them each week, about a week in advance, so you can plan each week as your schedule permits.  Keeping regular lab hours will be a good idea, but you won't be locked into it.

'''Aug. 28, 2006:''' All interested students who have not pre-registered yet should contact Lab Instructor [[User:Shusteff | Maxim Shusteff]], if you have not already done so, and attend the first lecture on Thursday, Sep. 7, 2006 at 12:00noon in 56-180.
