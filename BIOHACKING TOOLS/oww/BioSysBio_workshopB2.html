==Abstract==

===Proposed Content===

In this workshop, I will give an introduction to the construction and
analysis of kinetic models.  Mass-action kinetic and enzyme kinetics
will be briefly discussed.   A number of kinetic models dealing with
metabolism, signal transduction and gene expression will be introduced
and discussed.  Simple principles that govern the control and robustness
of networks will be illustrated.
