{{SJK comment|label=15:48, 15 October 2007 (CDT)|comment=It is great that you linked to the lab manual...and for sure there is no need to copy everything over.  However, some explanation of what you are doing is needed.  The summary should be written so that some other reader who doesn't know anything about the lab can know generally what and why you're doing.}}

The experiment performed is detailed on this page [http://www-hep.phys.unm.edu/%7Egold/phys307L/manual.pdf] under Balmer Series.

The data I obtained is on this page [[Physics307L:People/Gleicher/Notebook/071001]].
There is error in the data due to backlash in the gears and subjectivity in the measurement.



===Mercury===


'''My Measurements'''

Violet: 436 nm, 435 nm, 434.6 nm 

Green: 545 nm, 544.6 nm, 544 nm

Yellow: 577.1 nm, 576.1 nm, 570 nm





Using my data, I calculated the "true" value of the the lines of Mercury.

'''True Values''' 

Violet - 435.2 nm +/- 0.1nm

Green - 544.5 nm +/- 0.048nm

Yellow - 574.4 nm +/- 2.842nm

Red - not visible



Next, I measured the wavelength of the lines for hydrogen and calculated the true value and my error.

===Hydrogen Spectra===

'''My Measurements'''

Red: 656.1 nm, 656.8 nm, 657 nm

blue: 485.6 nm, 487 nm, 486.1 nm
 
violet I: 433.6 nm, 431.8 nm, 434 nm

violet II: 409.9 nm, 411.2 nm, 410.5 nm


{{SJK comment|label=15:50, 15 October 2007 (CDT)|comment=I don't think "true values" is a good label.  I think what you are reporting is the mean and standard error of the mean of your measurements, which is your best estimate of the "true value."  Other than the label, though, it is excellent that you report uncertainty for all the values!}}
'''True Values'''

Red - 656.6  +/- 0.04298052 nm

Blue - 486.2333333  +/- 0.096866545 nm

Violet I - 433.1333333 +/- 0.264298123 nm

Violet II - 410.5333333 +/- 0.081470538 nm

===Deuterium Spectra===

'''My Measurements'''

Red: 655 nm, 656.1 nm, 657 nm

blue:  485 nm, 484.8 nm, 486 nm

violet I : 433.2 nm, 433.8 nm, 434.5 nm

violet II: 409.5 nm, 410.2 nm, 413 nm


'''True Values'''

Red - 656.0333333 +/- 0.19309159 nm

blue - 485.2666667 +/- 0.079546037 nm

violet I - 433.8333333 +/- 0.081470538 nm

violet II - 410.9 +/- 0.660103808 nm


===Rydberg constant===


Given Value: R = 1.0967758 × 107 m−1

My values for the Rydberg constant are as follows:

10972282.65 1/m {{SJK comment|label=15:53, 15 October 2007 (CDT)|comment=Where is your estimate of the uncertainty in R????  You were so careful about reporting uncertainty for the individual measurements, and it is just as important (maybe more so) for the final value.}}
