"five <u>user friendly, menu-driven programs</u> that are intended mainly for users with <u>beginner to intermediate</u> levels of statistical expertise: <u>JMP, NCSS, Sigmastat, Statistica and True EPISTAT</u>. Of these, the first <u>four are general purpose</u> data analysis packages while True <u>EPISTAT is intended for medical scientists</u>. All have large user manual full of simple examples. <u>None offer anything like the same scope for power analysis as they do for statistical hypothesis testing</u>. This means that a researcher relying solely on one of these packages could analyze a study without being able to properly plan it or check its power. Sigmastat offers the widest scope for planning power or sample size (Table 3), although the ANOVA option doesn’t go beyond one-way. JMP is the most comprehensive in this respect, offering power calculations, tables, and power vs. sample size graphs for almost any fixed effect ANOVA design (but for nothing else). True EPISTAT can calculate approximate power and sample size for a limited assortment of tests and can produce graphs and some very limited tables. In Statistica, power and sample size can be calculated for some one-sample tests using the Process Analysis module, and OC (power vs. sample size) curves can be produced."

=== SigmaStat ===
"This is a <u>good starter package</u>. <u>Not very powerful</u>, and not all that flexible, but <u>simple and instructive</u>" [http://www.qub.ac.uk/cdda/visual/sigmastat.html]

=== MatLab ===
"Particular advantages were listed as: ease of <u>customisation, informative error messages, the ability to handle large matrices</u>. The main <u>disadvantage was the time taken to learn</u> the application. The UNIX version is command-line driven."
