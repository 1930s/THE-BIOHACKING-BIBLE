*Place order with Registry for parts to be synthesized
**As said in above bullet.
**We need R0010. Has CAP binding site.
*Prepare FACS samples for Thursday
**We will get cells from Drew's Lab.
*Order new parts from Blue Heron
**Specify on Registry!
***insulin - Karen Talmadge
***export tag
***etc?
*Order supplies
*Make stocks

===Test Constructs===
How are we going to test our system in its intermediate, and also its final stages? 
#Flow cytometry
#Beta gal assay
#Microscopy (detect gfp, bgal, etc)
#Western blot (measure protein levels)
#insulin assay?
#use cells as indicator - as cell-cell signalling system!
#*insulin receptor (research this)
#*sender/receiver
#*feedback (incorporate insulin output into regulating glucose - ultimately CAP - input)
#RT-PCR 
#*used to measure RNA levels
#Northern Blot
#*used to measure RNA levels

*Familarize
**Glucose receptor (what is the signal cascade?)
***plasmid?
***chromosome?
**Insulin plasmid (read the paper about it)
**How is insulin produce from E. coli?
*Tags
*Sequence of insulin
*Apoptosis in E. coli?
*List of things to get for lab
*Insulin is in 2 chains, so we need to look at how we can regulate it. In vitro?
