[[Media:IGEM_IMPERIAL_FullSystem_Model.sbml]]


==Model assumptions and relevance==
*General assumptions on gene expression modelling:
**Quasi-steady state hypothesis on mRNA expression.
**Gene activation can be approximated by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_equation Hill equations].

*Assumption on the Chemostat:
**It assumes that the prey molecule generator and the predator molecule generator populations are stable (the cell populations have reached steady-state).
**the degradation of the molecules is mainly due to the wash-out of the chemostat.

*Assumptions linked to the quorum sensing:
**As a first approximation, we assume that luxR and AHL molecules form a heterodimer (even if it has been found that the complex formed is more complicated)
**The concentration of the heterodimer is in equilibrium with the concentration of AHL
**LuxR is constitutively produced and reaches steady state before AHL production begins. [LuxR] in the prey can be considered constant
**The degradation rate of luxR and AHL-lactonase is due to the growth dilution which, in this case, is controlled by the chemostat
**AHL is diffusing freely throughout the system


==Characterization==

*Characterization of the parameters a, ao shall be done using the '''[[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2006/project/Oscillator/project_browser/Test_Sensing_Prey_Construct/Modelling | Prey Generator Test Contstruct]]'''
*Characterization of the parameters c, c0 shall be done using the '''[[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2006/project/Oscillator/project_browser/Test_Sensing_Predator_Construct/Modelling | Predator Generator Sensing Test Construct]]'''
*Characterization of the parameters b, b0 shall be done using the '''[[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2006/project/Oscillator/project_browser/Test_Killing_Predator_Construct/Modelling | Predator Generator Killing Test Construct]]'''
*The growth dilution can be controlled by the chemostat washout.
