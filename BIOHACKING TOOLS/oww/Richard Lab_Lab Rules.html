=== Our lab rules === 
To keep the lab running smoothly we have two "in-house training programs", developed by all of us through this site, and implemeted by the lab manager. The first focuses on general lab use, the second on the use of specific instruments.
*Training in general lab use
#know what maintenance work is expected in our individual lab area
#know how to label equipment and archive paperwork (folders, labels, etc)
#know where the garbage cans go, what goes in them (recycling)
#know how to use the "unknown table"
*Lab Safety
#Hazardous material: know  and use the "Satellite accumulation area", put material in secondary containers and non-leaking primary containers, put your name, date, and expected pickup date on special red label. The Lab manager updates the "Satellite accumulation area" logbook and calls Hazmat for pick up. In the accumulation area, separate Halogen from non-Halogen waste.  
#when labelling, enter full names, no abreviations, for fire safety issues. 
#know location of emergency shower, eyewashes, and first aid kit. Lab manager flushes the eyewash once a week. 
#know the Material Safety Data Sheets for the chemicals you're using 
#know the MSDS resources: [http://hazard.com/msds/ U of Vermont MSDS database], [http://www.ehs.psu.edu/hazmat/chemical.cfm  PSUs' EHS], [http://www.ilpi.com/MSDS/ref/nfpa.html NFDA diamond]. 
#know the fume hood procedure: verify that the hood is working, the presence of the sash recommended position (yellow sticker), the role of the sash (an explosion and splash guard, and it must be low to allow good air suction). Do not leave any chemicals in hood, or reactive reagents during an experiment. 
#know how to store chemicals: separate highly toxic ones, do not store other than cleaning supplies under the sink, do not store reactive chemicals close to each other (acids and bases). Keep acids away from flamables, except for glacila acetic acid. 
#disposing of chemicals, do not drain nitric or hydrofloric acid. Acids and bases can be neutralized (by dilution and drained. Dilution procedure: add acid to water and not the reverse (A to W), and flush the drain before and after. 
#know fire extinguisher locations (use only if properly trained).
#when purchasing chemicals look for safe alternatives, avoid mercury, carcinogens, etc.
#pressurized cylinders: close valve and remove regulators when not using. 
#extension cords, use appliance grade only.
#submit documentation of EHS safety training
#take the EHS safety training refresher every year
#know the lab safety logbook. It contains the weekly review of the Satellite collection area, the annual review of all chemicals, and the training sheets for all lab members. 
*lab website duties (this site is a logbook for the lab as well)
#know what portion of the materials list each of us is individually responsible for updating
#know how to use this website and edit it, use website editing etiquette
#website subfile titles: Do not use generic names, this is a community of lab websites; "Methods" means methods of everyone on wetware!!!!! "Richard:methods" mean our methods!
#know how to use the ANGEL news group for the lab
#online source for hazardous materials forms to be posted or used in Lab: [http://www.ehs.psu.edu/hazmat/lwmm.pdf]
*Lab manager responsibilities
#post accumulation area sign and weekly log
#update lab notebook: (weekly review of the Satellite collection area, the annual review of all chemicals, and the training sheets of all lab members).
#implement the lab rules
*Training in the use of instruments
#go through a rotation to briefly learn everybody else's methodology / instruments
