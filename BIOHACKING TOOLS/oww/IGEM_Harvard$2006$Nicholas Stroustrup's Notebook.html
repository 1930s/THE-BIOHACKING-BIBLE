Due to issues with T7 promoter, the following biobricks were rehydrated 6/14
*[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_J04430 J04430]
Constitutive (IPTG-inducable?) GFP
*[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_J04450 J04450]
Constitutive (IPTG?) RFP
*[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_I13522 I13522] 
Constitutive GFP using TetR promoter.  No experience; might not work.
*[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_I6060 I6060]
Constitutive (IPTG?) YFP.  Apparently gives uneven YFP expression

Transformed with 2ul of DNA on 15ul bacteria; twice for each plasmid.  Took 3 ul from each incubation of and added into two two mixed SOC cultures.  Let's see what happens when LacI GFP, RFP, YFP are co-cultured.

One of each LacI plasmid type, GFP, RFP, YFP, LacI were cultured overnight on plates treated with 10mM IPTG.
==Microscope Notes==
Overlap between FITC and YGFP blocks prevents differentiation between YFP and GFP.  RFP can be differentiated between YFP/GFP very well.

YFP/GFP fades ~3 hours after being taken out of the incubator after overnight incubation.  RFP was still strong at +3h.

IPTG doesn't make an apparent difference in fluoresence.

Made Glycerol cultures of 
*J04430 (lac GFP)
*J04450 (lac RFP)
*I13522 (tet GFP)

We need to transfer these constructs onto [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:pSB4A3 pSB4A3]

From each ligation, two plates were made:
*2ul ligation mix + 14ul Top10F' cells
*16ul ligation mix + 14ul Top10F cells.
Samples 10, 11, and 12 were plated on Carb plates, as gel purification removes the need to select against uncut GeneArt plasmids

===Results===
*12 hours later, no Kan plates had colonies except for the positive control.
*12 hours later, all carb plates except for the 2ul #12 plate had colonies.  The Carb positive control had an prder of magnitude more cells than the experimental plates.  Experimental plates had between 500 and 1000 colonies.  Contamination from uncut GeneArt plasmid is feared.  However, there is reason to believe that the Carb plates would do better as the Top10f' kit describes Kanomycin selection as "decreasing" transformation efficiency.

<br style="clear:both;"/>
The colonies seen on the Carb plates were digested, re-ligated GeneArt plasmid.  The gel purification did not eliminate all cut backbone, and the Carb selection did not remove the religated form.

#4ul PCR KaiB (all I had left) + 2ul Peng's 8.30 backbone digest + 4ul h20 + ligation mix -> 2ul on cells
#6ul PCR KaiC + 2ul Peng's 8.30 backbone digest + ligation mix -> 2ul on cells


Al ligations were run for 45 min at 25C and then overnight at 15C. Transformed cells were plated on Kan plates

''Results''
*Plates N5 and N6 (8.30 ligations #10 and #11) grew up with ~10 colonies each. 
*Plates P1, P2, P3 (KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC with Peng's backbone) produced a few hundred colonies each.

''Searching for Kan resistant bacteria on colonies from amp plate''

Many colonies from 8.30 AMP plates #10 #11 and #12 were restreaked on Kan plates, selecting against re-ligated GeneArt plasmids in hopes of identifying an insert-holding plasmid.

Result: two different streaks produced colonies for both #10 (KaiA) and #11  (KaiB).  A colony PCR was started for  4 colonies of each streak.  Noteto self: KaiA and KaiB labels switched on PCR and in LB cultures.  Label A2.4 may have mixed lb culture.
