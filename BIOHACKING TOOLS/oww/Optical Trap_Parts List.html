The laser mount may require an additional countersink for the hole which holds the fiber in order to allow the tip of the fiber to extend beyond the cage plate (depends on fiber ferrule).

'''Detection'''
----
<br>
The following are circuit layouts for the QPD detector board.  This is an extremely basic circuit design.

'''Software'''
----
<br>
These zip files contain some Labview VIs to control the Undergraduate Optical trap.  These are grouped into two zips, one which contains all of the New Focus Picomotor control subroutines, and one which contains a general set of data acquisition routines.  A short readme file is included with each to aid in application. <br>
