Elevators are often devices which lift and lower passengers from one floor of a building to another.  At MIT, however, elevators sometimes transform into inert assemblies of cable and steel, whose job seems to be sitting motionless in elevator shafts for extended periods.

The purpose of this page is to log the downtime of MIT's elevators.
