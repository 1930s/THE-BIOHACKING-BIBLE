This page describes the process for autoclaving waste in the Biology building (68) at MIT. 

==Materials==
1 bag of waste (double bagged in clear biohazard bags)

==Steps==
#For each bag of waste to be treated, fill out an autcolave waste tag (on the second shelf above the PCR machines in 564D), as well as the autoclave waste book (above the sink in 570).
#Get one of the test vials from 2nd floor (in same room as 5th floor media room, what room#?) and a piece of string about 3 ft long.
#Wrap the string aroung the vial, knot it, and secure it with tape
#Lower the test vial into the center of the autoclave waste (or as close as you can get) leaving the string hanging outside of the bin.
#Put the bag into an autoclave-safe bin and bring it to the autoclave.
#*Note: the bag should be as open as possible without the contents spilling out, in order to enable the steam to better penetrate the waste.
#Attach the 'Autoclaved Non-infectious Biomedical Waste' tag to the bag
#*Note: try and have this hanging outside the bin so that if there is a liquid pool after the autoclave run, the tag wont be damaged.
#Put the bin in the autoclave and run the autoclave on the 'fast' cycle for '''1hr at 250F, 22psi'''.
#Wait for cycle to complete and pressure to decrease.
#Open autoclave (remember to open the door slowly to allow steam to escape and be careful not to bumping against the very hot door), and remove the bin.
#Pull the test vial out of the autoclave waste using the string.
#*This should be returned to the 2nd floor room and a label affixed indicating the date, investigator, etc (labels are next to the drop off box or by Heather's desk).
#Seal off the waste using the metal twist-tie attached to the waste tag and then dispose of in the regular trash.
