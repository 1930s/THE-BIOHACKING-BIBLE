Orientation for UROPS and Grad Students

Orientation currently takes place every Monday (or Tuesday if the Monday is a holiday.)

At least a week before you start, please see Bob Burger to give him information he will need to fill out f the form that is a prerequisite for safety training.

You need to attend the first possible orientation.  One session involves access issues; the photo for the WI ID is taken at this time.

A tour of the lab is scheduled next, but the specifics should be arranged with Lera or a safety rep who will sign off on the safety training page.  Yelena or Guichy (evacuation coordinators) should also sign off on the sheet for evacuation compliance.

There is then the safety training.  It is important to get the safety trainer to sign off on form so that after hours access can be allowed.  Signatures from the safety officer and others should also be obtained.

There is IT training that will get you email password and access to the server.

Please note:  If UROPs wish to work after hours, a special letter has to be written by your PI.

Group Meeting:
Matsudaira Group meeting is a weekly meeting which takes place in the 6th Floor Conference Room on Wednesdays from 3-4:30 pm.  All lab members are required to attend. Each week an assigned member of the lab will give a presentation regarding their current work.  The slides, notes, etc should be emailed to Paul Matsudaira for review by the Friday prior to their specific presentation. 
Lodish Group meetings are held in the 6th Floor Conference Room on Wednesdays from 10 am-12 noon.   All lab members are required to attend. Each week an assigned member of the lab will give a presentation regarding their current work.

Individual Lab Meeting;
There is a rotating schedule for 30minute individual lab meetings with Paul Matsudaira. 
You will be updated and notified as to days and times. 

.

Some Basic Lab Rules:
Matsudaira lab -
∑ Everyone has a job in the lab. The assignments are updated every fall or as needed. 
∑ People in charge of ordering something, are responsible to check that we are always stocked with the item(s) and to put them away where they belong. If you see that something is running low, contact the person in charge. There are lists of lab responsibilities in all the lab bays; if you still have a question, just ask
∑ DO NOT leave empty boxes in our plastics supply room; just place it in the hallway outside the room. 
∑ For common chemicals like protease inhibitors, antibodies (labeled and unlabeled), storage boxes, etc. The rule of thumb is that the person that opens the last bottle or uses the last aliquot or the supply is getting low, he/she HAS to order that item immediately
∑ Make sure that you close well all fridges and freezers. Sometimes the freezers/fridges under the benches are left open
∑ Regarding the – 80 freezers, Try to minimize the time that the door is kept opened because too much ice builds up around the individual doors (this is true for all freezers in the lab as well). Because we have a lot of delicate samples and some stuff that is difficult to replace, we need to limit the number of people that can get into the –80 freezers; NO UROP is allowed to go into our –80 freezers
∑ Everyone has space allocated in the –20 and –80 freezers. Please use only the space assign to you. If you need more space, TALK TO GUICHY and we’ll find a solution





Lodish lab -
Lab jobs.  Every lab member is required to participate in general lab maintenance.   There is a list of lab jobs; each job is given a number of points depending on the amount of time and effort it entails.  To be sure that everyone assumes an equal share of responsibility, the total number of points for all jobs is divided by the number of lab members. Each lab member must assume responsibilities that add up to the requisite number of points.  Lab jobs are assigned once a year, usually in the fall.  When leaving the lab, people are required to pass their job on to another lab member, giving them (either verbally or in writing) any instructions necessary to carry it on effectively.



DEPARTURE CHECK LIST
People leaving the Matudaira lab are asked to leave their desk, bench and all other areas of the lab and Institute that they now occupy, clean and ready to be occupied by the next researcher.  The following checklist provides guidelines to follow and reminders of details easily overlooked.  Please allow yourself enough time to complete this checkout.  It always takes more time than you think it will!


1. Notify Guichy and Bob (lab administrator) of your expected departure date.  The lab administrator will notify the Whitehead Administration, who may have additional check-out requirements.  These will probably include turning in: ID card, building entry pass card, and all keys. 

2.  Clean your lab bench and desk area. 

3. Reagents:  Be sure to allow enough time to get rid of all of them.  Donate them to people who will take them away ASAP.  Place them on display for people to scavenge until a final date, by which time you will dispose of them.  Dispose of the contents in a NON-HAZARDOUS, SAFE MANNER.  If you have any questions about how to proceed, check with Lera.  Rinse bottles clean of any hazardous chemicals and peel off any labels.

4. Plates:  give away unused plates or media to people who want them.  Clear out all plates at lab bench, cold rooms, refrigerators and any plates or flasks in incubators. 

5. Check other locations for your personal reagents (hoods, cold rooms).  If another person wants them they should re-label them with their own name.  If not, throw them out.

6. Cold room: All plates, racks of tubes, and other material on your shelf and elsewhere should be removed.

7. Freezers:   Give Yelena a complete list and location of all cell lines and constructs. Give Guichy a complete list and location of purified proteins.

8. Notify the computer group that you will be leaving the Institute.

9. Leave your forwarding address with Macall, along with instructions about what to do with your mail.
