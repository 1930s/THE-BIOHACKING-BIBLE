==Standard error of the mean==

The '''standard error of the mean''' of a sample from a [[statistical population|population]] is
the [[standard deviation]] of the [[sampling distribution]] of the mean, and may be estimated by the formula:

:<math>S_E = \frac{\widehat\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}</math>

where

:<math>\widehat\sigma</math> is an estimate of the standard deviation &sigma; of the population, and
:''n'' is the size (number of items) of the sample.

Note: Standard error may also be defined as the standard deviation of the residual error term. (Kenney and Keeping, p. 187; Zwillinger 1995, p. 626)
