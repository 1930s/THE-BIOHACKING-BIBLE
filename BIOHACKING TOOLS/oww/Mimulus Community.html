==The ''Mimulus'' Genome==
The Joint Genome Institute (JGI/DOE) completed 6X coverage of the ''Mimulus'' genome in Spring 2007.  An assembly of the genome was completed in Summer 2007.  Members of the ''Mimulus'' Community are currently annotating the Genome.  JGI plans to complete 8X coverage of the genome later this year.  Annotation of the ''Mimulus'' Genome can be accessed though this [http://mimulus.private.openwetware.org/ link].  This is currently a private site, but will be open to the public soon.

==The Genus==
The genus ''Mimulus'' (historically "Scrophulariaceae," order Lamiales) has been a [http://www.mimulusevolution.org/ model plant system] for ecological and evolutionary genetics for over 50 years (Vickery, 1951).  

*Check out the [http://www.isu.edu/~bearpau2/Mimposter.html poster] of the phylogeny of the ''Mimulus'' genus.  

* Read a recent review about [http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/6801018a.html;jsessionid=6761F6C5882CFD97F5AF796018F91361   ''Mimulus'' as an emerging model system for the integration of ecological and genomic studies.]

===''Mimulus guttatus''  Complex===

The ''Mimulus guttatus'' species complex (yellow monkey flowers) is a group of closely related species exhibiting the common evolutionary transition from outcrossing to self-pollination. ''Mimulus'' presents an excellent model system for studies of evolution because of its broad diversity of floral morphologies, incomplete reproductive barriers, and its amenability to experimental manipulation.

===''Mimulus lewisii''  Complex===
Mimulus section Erythranthe is a western North American group of perennial wildflowers with a wide diversity of floral forms. Included within this section are the bee-pollinated M. lewisii and the hummingbird-pollinated M. cardinalis. This system has a long history of study (1), and continues to be the subject of active research in systematics (2) and the genetics and ecology of speciation (3-5). Another close relative of M. lewisii is the lesser-studied M. parishii, which is a small-flowered, highly selfing species of the desert Southwest. The diversity of pollination syndrome, mating system, and habitat preference found within this section makes it a uniquely amenable model system for studies in ecology, genetics, and evolutionary biology of natural populations.

==Seed Collections==
Below is an excel spreadsheet that lists the seed collections of ''Mimulus'' that are currently located at Duke University.  The seed collections are primarily composed of seeds from within the ''Mimulus guttatus'' complex. Most of these seeds can be made available for upon request.  Please allow a few weeks for orders to be fulfilled.  Contact [[David Lowry]] at david.lowry@duke.edu for seed requests or information about collection locations.
