Incubated at RT for 5 mins.

===Step 5===
Transformations into Invitrogen TOP10 cells
Heat shock 1min.

==Smell tests==
*Use 4.4&mu;L stock IA-OH per 10mL culture
*Use 40&mu;L 0.5M SA per 10mL culture 

===These were started today===
*100mL of each LB-Amp.  In 500mL or 1L flask.

====Dilutions====
*Used 1mL of pSB1AC3-J45200 (OD600nm=0.31) in each flask
*Used 0.27mL of pSB1AT3-J45120 (OD600nm=1.11) in each flask
*Used 0.27mL of pSB1AC3-J45250 (OD600nm=1.11) in each flask

Thus, each strain was diluted back to OD 0.003 in each flask.

====Samples====

#Coculture pSB1AC3-J45250 and pSB1AT3-J45120 without salicylic acid and isoamyl alcohol
#Coculture pSB1AC3-J45250 and pSB1AT3-J45120 with salicylic acid and isoamyl alcohol
#Coculture pSB1AT3-J45200 and pSB1AT3-J45120 without salicylic acid and isoamyl alcohol
#Coculture pSB1AT3-J45200 and pSB1AT3-J45120 with salicylic acid and isoamyl alcohol

====Results====
*J45200 has some smell in the presence of precursors but J45250 does not during exponential phase.
*Coculture of pSB1AC3-J45200 and pSB1AT3-J45120 in the presence of precursors smells minty in exponential phase.
*Coculture pSB1AC3-J45250 and pSB1AT3-J45120 in the presence of precursors maybe smells minty in exponential phase.
*Coculture of pSB1AC3-J45200 and pSB1AT3-J45120 in the presence of precursors smells like banana in stationary phase.
*Coculture pSB1AC3-J45250 and pSB1AT3-J45120 in the presence of precursors smells like banana in stationary phase.  You could maybe argue that this one smells more like banana than the coculture of pSB1AC3-J45200 and pSB1AT3-J45120.
*Both J45200 and J45250 smell like banana in stationary phase.

==Yeast Stuff==
# Grew up overnights of ADH1promoter+BSGD in pRS306.
##Oddly enough, only 3 of my 9 overnights grew up. Those 3 had been innoculated with a ton of cells.
# Miniprepped vectors and digested to linearize.
## All enzymes linearized the vectors beautifully, except NdeI only partially digested G5 miniprep.
##Thus, combine NcoI, NdeI, StuI, and XcmI digests into three master tubes (one each for G5, G6, G7), and transform on Nov. 1, after SB lunch.
#Yeast cells didn't grow up overnight.
##This was unexpected, as a parallel culture grown overnight in the same media grew fine. I can only conclude that the slow growth was due to the fact that I innoculated from a freezer stock, which I have never done before and so don't know what to expect.
## I will transform the yeast tomorrow (Wed), and cut even more corners to get a culture ready for Friday.

==General to do list==
*Streak and start overnight culture of pSB1AC3-J45250/pSB3K3-J45400 again.
*Cotransform pSB1AC3-J45250 and pSB3K3-J45400 again into IK cells
*Make more LB media
*Start overnight cultures of
**pSB1AT3-J45120 (grows fast)
**pSB1AK3-J45180 (do extra just in case)
**pSB1AC3-J45250 (grows fast)
**pSB1AT3-J45200 (do extra, grows slow)
**pSB1AC3-J45700 (do extra, grows slow)
*Autoclave some 250 mL flasks covered in foil - done
*Start overnight of IK cells to make competent cells tomorrow
