Over the last 7+ years, Ed and his lab have constructed large-insert environmental clone libraries, made from the microbial fraction of seawater, taken from a variety of depths at several locations. As part of an NSF [http://www.lternet.edu/microbial_ecology/ Microbial Observatory] Grant to E.D., I have worked to leverage the sequence information in the Monterey Bay library to construct a "census" microarray for a portion of the native microbial community. This array is now allowing a higher-throughput mapping of microbes than has previously been possible.  

Monterey Bay is a long-term ecological research site, with the efforts of several major research institutions focused on understanding the Bay's oceanography. DNA samples have been collected by the DeLong Lab at monthly intervals since 1998, in tandem with the [http://www.mbari.org Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute's] (MBARI) [http://www.mbari.org/bog/ Biological Oceanography Group] (BOG) research cruises. We hope that by examining these archived DNA samples with the microarray, and by exploring the results of this multi-year census in the context of the BOG group's chemcial, physical and biological analyses, we can form a more complete picture of the dynamics of Monterey Bay microbial communities.
