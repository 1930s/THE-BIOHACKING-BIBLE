#glycerol: all LCs '''-done'''
#start a smell test: add precursor to the LCs of 0-Q-119 and O-Q-199 '''-done, however, results don't look good'''
#am miniprep (12): J45397 (1), J45398 (1), J45399 (3), J45299 (3), J45319 (3), pE3 (1) '''-done'''
#analyze: incoming 20 sample sequencing order '''-done'''
#*throw out bad sequences '''-done'''
#digest: J45299 (3) and J45319 (3) with '''XP''' '''-done'''
#*run a gel
#sequence: (32 wells) '''-done'''
#*J45220-C-mut with ATF1 primers '''-done'''
#*all other minipreps (except pE3) '''-done'''
#*J45398-no mut: 3,4,6,7 '''-done'''
#PCR: pmsCEAB out of pE3(new) and pE3R '''-done''' 
#*adjust annealing time, check GC content, ask advisor advice on PCRing large coding regions '''-done'''
#*clean up??
#*run a gel
#graph the plate reader data (call stephen)
#3-part ligate/transform into A/C backbone:
#*J45299:XP with R0011:ES
#*J45319:XP with R0011:ES
#pellet: yeast cells in big centrifuge, resuspend in milk, try baking 
#*ask samantha for help
#pm miniprep: iGEM yeast 
#*follow yeast miniprep protocol, vortex cells first, ask samantha for help
#*we can do XS digest/freeze of yeast miniprep on monday and ligate/transform with ATF1 when samantha is around and when we have tried out the bread machine
