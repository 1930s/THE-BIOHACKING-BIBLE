===<b>Monday:</b>===
 Materials here:
   fluoroscein oligos
   primers for phoA, malE, scFvs, fecA, fecA', fecA promoter
 To Do:
  PCR -- malE
         fecA wt.
         fecA promoter
         scFvs (3)
         phoA
  
 Figure out:
  what is expected from the gels
  figure out general what to do for gels

===<b>Tuesday:</b>===
 Check PCRs products: run gels to check for size
    if pcr worked: digest malE, scFvs (gel extraction? or other method?) and put into plasmids as biobricks
                   make plasmids of fecA and phoA
    if pcr doesn't work: PCR again --> troubleshoot
 
 Digest and assemble promoter and rbs combos for later assemblies

===<b>Wednesday:</b>===
 Materials here: 
     primers: fecI, fecR
 To Do:
  Test if ligations worked:
        if yes: store biobricks of malE, scFvs
                transform E Coli with fecA/phoA plasmids
        if no: redo ligation
  
  PCR fecI
  PCR fecR wt.

===<b>Thursday:</b>===
 Check PCR products: run gels to check for size
        if pcr worked: disgest fecI and put into plasmid as biobrick
               put fecR into plasmid to fix cut site
        if no: redo PCR
 
 PCR fecA/phoA plasmids with middle primers to fix cut sites

===<b>Friday:</b>===
 Check PCR products: gels for fecA/phoA after template plasmid has been removed--> cut with enzyme with newly removed cut site
        if PCRs worked: store fecA/phoA as biobricks
 
 Check ligations of fecI and fecR
        if ligations of fecI worked: store fecI as biobrick
                                     transform fecR into bacteria in order to remove pstI site
