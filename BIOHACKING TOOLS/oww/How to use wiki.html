*New pages which do not have any contents will be red. If you click the blank page (which is red), you can immediately update contents.

*To include links to image uploads such as GIF, use a "image" link.
*To add an image to a page, the image must first be uploaded in OpenWetWare(see on the left-Upload file). Then you need to reference the image in your wiki document like the following. 
*Inside the link format [[ ]], write ''image:engineering.gif|40px|Laurie Engineering Building'', which will look like this: [[image:engineering.gif|40px|Laurie Engineering Building]]
