Note: Rinse out all glassware with DI H<sub>2</sub>O (to get rid of detergent residue) before use in this protocol.

#Inoculate an overnight culture of the E. coli strain INVJαF’ containing the pTq plasmid [Engelke, D.R. et al. (1990) Anal. Biochem. 191: 396-400] in LB.  (In our lab this is pTaq, glycerol stock IJ3; carb resistance.) Use 100ul of this overnight culture to inoculate a 1L culture.
#Grow 1L culture 11 hours (OD approx. 0.8) and add IPTG to final concentration of 124mg/L.  Induce at 37° for 12 hours with shaking (longer induction times lead to degradation of the enzyme.)
#Harvest cells by centrifugation and wash in 100ml buffer A (see below).  Recover cells and resuspend in 50ml buffer A plus 4mg/ml lysozyme.  Incubate 15 minutes at room temperature.
#Add an equal volume (50ml) of lysis buffer (see below) and incubate at 75° for 1 hour.  Clear lysate by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm in SS34 for 15 minutes at 4° (do NOT use blue-cap tubes – they will crack at such high speeds!).
#To cleared lysate, slowly (over the course of ~30 minutes) add 30g ammonium sulfate ((NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) per 100ml with stirring (enzymes denature at air/liquid boundaries ==> avoid bubbles!  We suggest using the smallest stir bar available on low setting) at room temperature.  Let stir an additional half hour.  Centrifuge this solution as in step 4 and harvest protein ppt (some will be in a pellet, but much of it will be on the surface and stuck to the walls.)
#Resuspend protein in 20ml buffer A per 100ml cleared lysate and dialyze 2x12 hours (we use slide-a-lyzers overnight) against storage buffer (see below).  
#After dialysis, dilute the resulting protein 1:1 with storage buffer.  Run PCR using a dilution series of this new taq (dilute with storage buffer).  Determine appropriate dilution for use, dilute if necessary, aliquot and store at -80°.

Sterilization: Filter sterilize Buffer A (do not autoclave).  Lysis Buffer does not need to be autoclaved if used right away (within 24 hours).  Do NOT add PMSF/Pefabloc or DTT until AFTER autoclaving.  Chill buffers before use.
