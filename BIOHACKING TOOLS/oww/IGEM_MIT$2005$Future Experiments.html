====Pathway ToxR====
*Test Expression of ToxR
**Biobrick ToxR gene
**Tag ToxR w/ antibody recognition/GFP
**Test for presence of ToxR w/ FACs 
*Test Function of Pathway of ToxR
**Biobrick ctx promoter
**Suffix insertion of GFP into ctx promoter plasmid
**Test pH/temperature changes for presence of GFP
**Alternative? E. coli not sensitive to temp/pH changes?
*Test Fusion of ToxR
**[Marker][ToxR][Transmembrane Protein][Marker]
**Test for first marker
**Test for second marker
**If both present, entire gene is produced!

====Pathway FecA====
*Isolate FecA transduction gene sequence
*Find coding sequences for FecR, FecI, Rpo, TonB, Exb D, Exb B, GFP, and fec promoter
*Biobrick
*Screen a linker that work to link FecA and antibody
*Fuse antibody with FecA w/ diff. linkers to antibody
*Screen for signal
