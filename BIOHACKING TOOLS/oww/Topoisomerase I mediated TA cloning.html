==Possible enzymes to generate 3' T overhang==

'''None of these enzymes will work because it appears as if the topoisomerase enzyme needs some duplex DNA in order to function.'''

Each can accommodate the topoisomerase site CCCTT
*[http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/productR0600.asp BmrI]
**offset cutter that leaves 3' single base overhang
**two sites in sopC (incD) repeat region of BBa_I50000
**no sites in BBa_I50020
**no sites in BBa_P1010, BBa_P1000, BBa_B0055, BBa_B0054

**Austin says this is a very bad enzyme.
*[http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/productR0533.asp XcmI]
**long recognition sequence with internal N<sub>9</sub> that leaves 3' single base overhang
**no sites in BBa_I50000
**no sites in BBa_I50020
**no sites in BBa_P1010, BBa_P1000, BBa_B0055, BBa_B0054
**100% activity only in NEBBuffer 2

Topoisomerase sites internal to vector components are not important because topoisomerase only operates near double stranded breaks.

Based on the preexistence of sites in the designed parts, XcmI looks like a good bet but it is not as robust to buffer conditions as BmrI.

==Topoisomerase I==

Most of the papers reference Topoisomerase I from vaccinia.  It seems to be available commercially at Epicentre. [http://www.epibio.com/item.asp?ID=274&CatID=112 html] [http://www.epibio.com/pdftechlit/108pl092.pdf protocol]

*[[Anselm Levskaya]] - I've gotten Vaccinia WR strain isolate and am presently cloning the topoisomerase IB gene out.  Classically this is purified by using a phosphocellulose column but I'm going to just try a His-Tagged approach since it's a small protein.

==Questions==
#The authors add a primer TOPO-5 into the mix when they add the isomerase.  It seems like this primer should not be necessary.  Does the topoisomerase I "need" some duplex DNA extending out from where it will nick in order to cleave the backbone?  Austin thinks most enzymes do need duplex DNA.
#How much of a performance hit will we take if we don't do all the purification steps they do ... it kind of seems like a lot of work (even though you only have to prep the vector once for multiple reactions).
#Can a restriction enzyme and topoisomerase I cleave simultaneously or will they occlude one another?
#Does TOPO TA cloning have a better success rate than TA cloning or is it just simpler?
