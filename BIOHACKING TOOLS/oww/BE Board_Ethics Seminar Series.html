Ms. Hammersla,

A group of biological engineering graduate students is trying to develop a bioethics series of talks/discussions for IAP 2008. We were thinking of including intellectual property as the subject of one of these sessions, including perhaps some of the following: what in biology is/should be patentable, how patents affect healthcare, and how intellectual property laws vary internationally.

After reading your bio on the MIT General Counsel webpage, I was wondering if you have any suggestions for possible speakers on this subject and additional resources for us to consult, as well as what other subtopics in intellectual property to consider.

Thank you for your time,

Rachel Miller<br>
