==Weekend June 24-25, 2006==
#Maybe pour SUMO gel on Sunday night

==Monday, June 26, 2006==
#Brainstorm on why transformations are failing
#Make new freezer stock of analog-inhibited Cdc28
#DIAGNOSTICS:
##Pour more SCD -U-T plates
##POur more SCD -U-H plates
###Use yeast freezer stocks to plate test transformations.
##Re-digest 404 with SnaBI and run an agarose gel to see if it worked.
#Grow up an overnight of pGEV e. coli so I can miniprep more tomorrow
#Pour a sumo gel with 12% acrylamide
#Order restriction enzymes from NEB, and run diagnostic digest on pGEV
#Grow s288c (non-knockout yeast) on my old plates and see if they can survive at all - if they can, then the plates are ok - if they can't, then the plates are bad.

#Run sumo gel without 379 alpha - and use peristaltic pump (make more buffer)
#Make new freezer stock of yeast from yesterday's overnight culture
#Transform SSY403
#Miniprep pGEV, pRS404 and pRS414 out of E. coli
#Do characteristic digests of pGEV and run on gel

==Wednesday, June 28, 2006==
#'''TALK AT GROUP MEETING TODAY'''
#Check on SUMO GEL
##FIX PERISTALTIC PUMP
##Make more anode buffer
###Learn to use pH meter
#Check on plates
#Order antibodies -'''on hold until I hear from Drew'''
##Anti-Fus3
##Anti-active MAPK
##What to do about anti-Cdc28 antibodies?
#When to do beta-estradiol stocks?  Probably not until transformation is working.
#'''Think''' about pGEV issue/digest
##Do another pGEV digest, same as yesterday, just to be sure I've done it right.
##Run out old gel to get 'exact' length of EcoRV-cut fragment
#Grow new overnight of yeast?
##If cells in -80 freezer are not competent, or if we decide the EZ transformation really doesn't work, we'll need new cells.

==Thursday, June 29, 2006==
#Do transfer and set up overnight incubation of Western
#Transform pGEV in to yeast, with 404, 414, and 416.
#Grow up overnight of 403 that are currently on a plate in the 30 degree room.

==Friday, June 30, 2006==
#Make new freezer stock of 403 chemically inhibited yeast.
#Start Western on overnight incubation
#Pour new SUMO gel
#Native extraction!
