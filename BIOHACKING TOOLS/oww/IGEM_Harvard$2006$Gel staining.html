====EtBr staining of mini PA gels====

Incubate in 10μL EtBr + 100 mL Tris-glycine buffer for 30 min.

====Coomassie staining of mini PA gels====

Protocol from Pierce using [http://www.piercenet.com/Products/Browse.cfm?fldID=02051015 GelCode Blue]:

*  Wash 
**Native PAGE: Rinse gel with ultrapure water for 5 minutes. 
**Note: Gels electrophoresed with MOPS or MES running buffers must be prefixed with a 50% methanol and 7% acetic acid solution for 15 minutes and then washed with ultrapure water to remove fixing solution. GelCode ® Blue Stain penetrates prefixed gels better than non-fixed gels and, therefore, standard SDS-PAGE gels may also be prefixed with good results. 

*Stain Note: Mix the GelCode ® Blue Stain Reagent solution immediately before use by gently inverting or tipping and swirling the bottle several times. Such mixing is especially important when using Product No. 24592 with a dispenser pump. Do not shake bottle to mix the solution. 
**Add 20 ml of GelCode ® Blue Stain Reagent for an 8 x 10 cm mini gel. Additional reagent may be required if a large tray is being used. Gently shake tray and periodically monitor protein band development. Stain intensity reaches a maximum within approximately 1 hour. Gels may be stained overnight without increasing background. 
**Note: PhastGel ® Gels may require increased staining times (2 hours to overnight) for optimal band development. 

*Destain (Water Wash EnhancementTM Step) Replace Stain Reagent with ultrapure water. Several water changes for a 1-2 hour period may be necessary for optimal results. This step enhances stain sensitivity, as weak protein bands continue to develop.

* fix gels for 20 to 50 minutes in fixative enhancer solution
** fixative enhancer solution: 200 mL MeOH, 40 mL Bio-Rad fixative enhancer concentrate, 40 mL glacial acetic acid, 120 mL water
* rinse in water for 10 minutes, replace water, rinse again for 10 minutes
** ''the gel has a tendency to curl up during this step, and so you may have to manually uncurl it, or turn it over in the water'' [[User:Matthewmeisel|Matthewmeisel]]
* 5 minutes before use, place 35 mL water in a flask, and add, in order, with stirring: 5 mL Bio-Rad silver complex solution, 5 mL Bio-Rad reduction moderator solution, and 5 mL Bio-Rad image development reagent
* immediately before use, add 50 mL of room temperature Bio-Rad development accelerator reagent (ordinarily stored at 4{{c}})
* stain gels for desired amount of time in this mixture
* stop staining in 5% acetic acid solution, incubate for 15 min.
* rinse with water for 5 min.

====SYBR gold staining====

[http://probes.invitrogen.com/media/pis/mp11494.pdf Protocol] from Invitrogen:

* staining solution: 10 {{ul}} of 10,000x [https://catalog.invitrogen.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewCatalog.viewProductDetails&productDescription=1095&CMP=LEC-GCMSSEARCH&HQS=sybr%20gold Invitrogen SYBR Gold] in 100 mL TBE buffer, stored in dark plastic container at 4{{c}}
* incubate gel in staining solution for 10 to 40 min.
*staining should be carried out in dark (wrap aluminum foil around container)
* staining solution may be reused if desired for two to three more gels
