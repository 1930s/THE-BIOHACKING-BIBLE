==Probing Protein-DNA Interactions by Unzipping DNA with Optical Tweezers==
===Our initial proof-of-principle publication in the Wang Lab at Cornell=== 
[[Image:Paper_1_Fig2A.jpg|right|thumb|Figure 2A from the Biophys. J. paper.  The black trace shows unzipping force for a single DNA molecule in the absence of protein.  The red trace shows in the presence of a DNA-binding protein, with predicted binding curves shown as dotted lines.  Unoccupied binding sites marked with arrows.]]

===Our follow-on paper showing that unbinding forces can be analyzed nicely with Evan Evans' Dynamic Force Spectrosocpy (DFS) model===
[[Image:PRL Fig 3, color.png|right|thumb|Fig. 3 from the PRL.  Orange bars are histograms of 449 total unbinding events.  Dashed curves are maximum likelihood fits of the PDF from Evan Evans' DFS model, each fit to a single rate.  Solid lines are PDFs from a single best fit for all rates.  Vertical dashed bars represent unaccessible ranges to our experiment.]]

*Buried in this paper is the "loading rate clamp" that we used and which greatly simplifies data analysis as well as provides much cleaner data.  Also, our maximum likelihood method for data analysis is better than the typical method of fitting Gaussians to histograms, but this was also buried in footnotes.  It's been while since published, but the Koch lab would like to publish the details of these methods, as they would be very helpful to others doing DFS.
