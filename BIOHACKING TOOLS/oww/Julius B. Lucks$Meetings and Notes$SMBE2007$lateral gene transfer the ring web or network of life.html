== Words to Look Up ==
* Robertson Foulds distance (tree distance method)

== Talk ==
* early 80s - Carl Woese added archea via 16/18S rRNA trees
* 1995 - ''H. Influenzae'' sequenced - shortly later 2 strains of ''E. coli''
** 2 strains of ''E. coli'' - same species - 25% different genome sizes
* differences in phylogenetic trees when use 16S rRNA or pseudouridine tRNA
** lots of lateral transfer of genes
* Ford Doolittle - Nov 1999 - Science
** 'most archael and bact genes contain genes from multiple sources'
** 'if lgt can be limited to special categories of gene, then no heirarchical classification can be taken as natural'
* Darwin - 'a classification based on any single character, however important that may be, has always failed.'
* look at all the trees - do they agree or not?
* supertree approach
** amalgamate information from disparate data sources (extension of consensus approach)
** explore congruence across datasets
** identify datasets w/ unusual features
** Clann software
*** input trees derived from orthologs - diff sets of leaves
*** candidate supertree
*** tree to tree distance between input tree and supertree
**** prune supertree to have same set of leaves until has same set of leaves as input, then look at distance
*** score (sum distances) supertree (0 if perf compatible with all input trees, > 0 otherwise)
*** search over supertrees
*** do a permutation to create random dataset - permutation test
* gamma proteobacteria - compatibility of each of input trees better than random
** can have a meaningful supertree
* deep-level prokaryotic - compatibility of each of input trees '''NOT''' better than random
** input trees could be very bad
** bad ortholog detection
** horizontal transfer so pervasive that phylogenetic relationship completely eroded
* Choi, PNAS, 104, 4489, 2007 - Global extent of horizontal gene transfer.
* diff methods for same data give diff trees - method problem
* see where eukaryote fitted on prokaryote tree - use supertree method
** eukaryotes went with cyanobacteria
*** cyanobacteria endosymbiosis more recent than mitochondrial
** removed - went with alpha-proteobacteria (mitochondrial endosymbiosis)
** removed - went in middle of archaea (thermoplasmatalis)
* bacteria and archaea not monopdylecit
* eukaryo are monophyletic, but have 3 parents (cyanobacteria, alpho-proteobacteria, archaea)

== Words to Look Up ==

== Talk ==
* 1st slide is a tree stump
* new title: 'The practice of classification and the theory of evolution, and what the demise of Darwins Tree of Life hypothesis means for both of them'
* outline
** classification
** evolution as a theory
** TOL specific version of an evol theory - how TOL hypoth untrue
** implications of this for practices of classification
* classification
** natural and useful heman practice
** 'our job as sytematists is not to discover wahat an organism truly is, but rather to decide what we should call it' - Baptiste and Doolittle
** inclusive heirarchies 
*** arbitrary and negotiable - dewey decimal system 
*** taxanomy - we think natural and non-negotiable - not something we decide, but something we discover
**** Why this difference?
***** 2000 years of western philosophy (essentialist - things really are things)
***** species are real things
***** Darwin's TOL hypothesis - spec form of evolution that relates to classification
* evolution as gen theory
** 1858 William Paley - watch - intelligent design
** 2 part theory claiming past explains present
*** (1) adaptation and (2) classification have historical, not theistic or metaphysical purpose
** Darwin's theory - specific model how past processes affect current
*** 'from the 1st dawn of life all org beings class in groups onto groubs, not arb - something we dont decide, but discover'
*** organisms appear to be related because they are related
** TOL - classification tree like because process of creation is tree like - one of successive branching
** TOL - ladder which helped community to adopt larger theory of evolution
** 1859 - tree-like class gotten credibility by association with TOL hypoth (which got further credibility)
** Alec Panchen - 'Clossification, Evolution and the Nature of Biology', 1992
*** TOL circular argument
** Zuckerlandl and Pauling, 1965 - basic theory of molec phylogeny
* 1987- Woese - Bacteriological Reviews - summary of his work
** considered lateral gene transfer
* Claim TOL hypothesis untrue
** Bergey's Manual (1st ed 1923) of Bacteriology - made some claims obout phylogenetic relationships
** Welch, 2002 - 3 sequenced ''E. coli'' strains sequenced - only 40% genes overlay
*** species - many of these genes used in a species classification
** Walsh, 2007 - more than 1/2 genes of archeae for metab have best hits in bacterio
*** phenotypes not being det by process not underlined by branching
** eukaryotes as a whole - more a sister group to bacteria than archaea for more than 1/2 the genes
** universal core of genes shared by all genomes - something around 30
* implications of this untruthfulness for classification and evolution
** many of prokaryote properties not inhereted in branching classification
** helps to disentangle evolution and classification (used to be completely intertwined)
*** can still do phylogenies, but treat them as classifications - no 'really is' pressure anymore
**** multiple proper places for organimsm in classification scheme
** general theory - present happened spontaneusly from the past - through general evolution
** but evolution not a branching process
