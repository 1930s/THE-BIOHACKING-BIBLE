==Materials== 
* Qiaprep Spin Kit (27106)
* [[Griffitts:Common_buffers#TE_buffer|TE buffer]]
* 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes (1 per culture)

==Procedure==
* Grow DH5α with appropriate plasmid in liquid LB (4 mL) for 12-18 hours
** Add the appropriate [[Griffitts:Stock_solutions#Antibiotics|antibiotics]] if necessary
* Label your spin columns and microcentrifuge tubes
* Centrifuge 1.3 mL of culture at full speed for 30 seconds
* Dump and tap out supernatant
* Add another 1.3 mL of culture
* Spin at full speed for 30 seconds
* Resuspend pellet in 250 μL P1
** The P1 is kept in the fridge
** Make sure to use P1 that has RNAse added
* Add 250 μL P2
* Immediately invert 3 times
* Let stand for 2 minutes
* Add 350 μL N3
* Immediately invert 8 times
* Centrifuge for 6 minutes at full speed
* Carefully move the supernatant (~820 μL) to a spin column
* Centrifuge for 30 seconds at full speed
* Remove flowthrough
* Add 650 μL of wash buffer PE to column
* Centrifuge for 30 seconds at full speed
* Remove flowthrough
* Centrifuge for another 60 seconds at full speed
* Move column to a labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube
* Add 50-100 μL TE directly to disk
** Don't touch the membrane with your tip
* Let stand 1-2 minutes
* Centrifuge for 60 seconds at full speed to elute DNA
