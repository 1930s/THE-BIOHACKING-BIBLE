==Good==
*<bbpart>I20260</bbpart>(b0032) - Seq verified (complete)
*<bbpart>I20266</bbpart>(J61100) - Seq verified (complete)
*<bbpart>I20262</bbpart>(b0030) - Promoter verified, RBS may have 1 bp deletion, incomplete sequencing
**Currently repeating seq, 1bp deletion is OK anyway, can just define a new part# for it.
*<bbpart>I20265</bbpart>(b0034) - Seq verified across P.RBS junction, incomplete in GFP 
**Currenlty repeating seq

==Questionable==
*<bbpart>I20263</bbpart>(b0031) - built, but not sequenced (sending for seq on 1/28)
*<bbpart>I20264</bbpart>(b0033) - built (L6#3 from 1/23 transformation) is being tried in experiment on (1/27) and will be sent for seq on (1/28)
**The L6#2 that we had run previously, has a double insertion of B0033.
