The bacterial enzyme &beta;-galactosidase (gene LacZ) is frequently used as reporter gene in mouse biology. Its expression can be easily located with a LacZ stain using the artificial substrate X-gal. In the case of a LacZ construct under an endogenous promoter, this can reveal expression patterns during embryo development.

== steps ==

* transfer the embryo into 1.5ml tubes
* fix the embryo at 4°C for 30-60min
* wash the embryo 3x 20min at RT to remove fixative and permeabilise
* stain embryos in the dark with LacZ staining solution
* wash embryos in PBS, store in PBS in fridge for some days to intensify stain
* store in 70% EtOH indefinitely
