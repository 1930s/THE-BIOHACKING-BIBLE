Running ''bar(bins,histsample(1,:))'' would plot a histogram bar graph of the "data" collected in the first "trial."  ''[histx, histy] = bar(bins,histsample(1,:))'' generates vectors ''histx'' and ''histy'' so that ''plot(histx,histy)'' results in the same plot as ''bar(bins,histsample(1,:))''. Having vectors ''histx'' and ''histy'' on hand might prove useful later.

 for i=1:50
     [histx(i,:), histy(i,:)] = bar(bins,histsample(i,:))
