Soon after deciding to go for the iGEM competition, we started to advertise. However, it was already around Easter.

*Formatting the announcement as a '''flyer'''
*Setting-up the flyer around '''Campus'''
*Sending flyer to '''undergrad mailing list''' (2nd and 3rd years)
*Putting flyer into internal college Newspaper
|-
| colspan="2" style="background:#efefef;" |'''What happened ...'''
|-
| colspan="2" |
*Because it was already easter, many students had already a placement.
*We got 20+ applications.
*Mostly thanks to email sent on the mailing lists
*Also friend of a friend worked
*No one spotted the ad in the newspaper or around campus.
*We had a better response from Biology undergrads than engineering. 'Synthetic Biology' was still low profile in the Imperial engineering faculty. Using 'Biological engineering' could have helped.
|-
| colspan="2" style="background:#efefef;" |'''Next time ...'''
|-
| colspan="2" |
*We will start earlier the advertissment (around Xmas)
*Use of mailing list + targetting student Reps to spread the word
*Give short introduction at the beginning of a lecture during term.
*Of course, having done it once is going to help us too. Students from last summer are keen to give seminars and be our ambassadors for next year.

| 
*To apply, students had to submit an Essay about Synthetic Biology (200-300 words) + CV.
*Short listed cndidates were invited for an interview (15min Presentation of a iGEM 2005 project + their ideas about future extensions + questions)
*We wanted to have a well balanced team between engineers and biologists.
|-
| colspan="2" style="background:#efefef;" |'''What happened ...'''
|-
| colspan="2" |
*Interviewing process was long and tedious but worthwile. 
*Having the students to present a former iGEM project helped them to touch on Synthetic Biology concepts.
|-
| colspan="2" style="background:#efefef;" |'''Next time ...'''
|-
| colspan="2" |
*We will manage better a waiting list if some students are dropping out.

*booking some teaching lab space.
*booking a permanent meeting room (tables, white board, video projector).
*making sure to have a computers booked.
*granting building access in the different faculties.
|-
| colspan="2" style="background:#efefef;" |'''What happened ...'''
|-
| colspan="2" |
*We had 2 working environments: a 'base camp' and a wetlab.
*In the 'base camp', we had a meeting area + video projector and 5 computers to access Wiki and do presentations, simulations ...
*In the wetlab, it was a standard teaching lab (level 0 containment). However we were missing easy access to -80C freezer but we had a useful blackboard.
*Most of the equipments we were using were spread around campus.
*White board was great but we lost some info from time to time. Need to take pictures of white/blackboards.

| colspan="2" |
*We managed to get money from Engineering and Biology Faculties.
*We didn't investigate at all private fundings.
*We didn't plan enough in our budget for social events or trips to visit other UK teams.

|-
| colspan="2" |
*Getting the team to raise money before the summer (especially for social events).
*As a break the ice type of work, the team could come up with a marketing campaign and approach companies. Get events sponsorised or team T-shirts paid.
