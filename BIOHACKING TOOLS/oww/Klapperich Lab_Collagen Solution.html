==Overview==

Protocol for making 0.05% w/v collagen dispersion in acetic acid.

==Materials==
===Reagents===
*5 mL of 0.05M acetic acid
*2.5 mg of collagen (from human placenta) 

===Equipment===
*Homogenizer
*50 ml beaker
*Ice bath
*Ultrasonicator

==Procedure==
===Making 0.05 M solution of acetic acid===
Note: This solution has a shelf life of one week.
#Fill sterilized bottle with 5 mL of Millipore water.
#Add 14.3 ÂµL acetic acid.

===0.5% w/v Dispersion of Collagen in Acetic Acid===
Note:  Keep collagen mixture at below 20&deg;C.
#Add 2.5 mg of collagen to a 10 ml sterilized beaker.  (0.05 % w/v)
#Add 5 ml of 0.05 M acetic acid to the beaker. 
#Mix solution with homogenizer at full speed for approximately 5 minutes, or until no large fibrils or chunks are apparent.  Make sure that tip has been washed thoroughly (ethanol, rinse with Millipore water)  
#Place beaker in ice bath.
#Set the sonicater controller to Amplitude 100% (dial), 20 min, 5 sec on, 10 sec off. 
#Place sonicater horn in collar, making sure tip of sonicater does not touch the bottom of the beaker.  Press START/STOP on sonicater controller.

==Notes==
*The mixture may be stored in a capped bottle at 4&deg;C for about 4 months.  
*Re-blend at 4&deg;C at an amplitude of 60 with the pulser set to 5 sec for 15 minutes to use.
