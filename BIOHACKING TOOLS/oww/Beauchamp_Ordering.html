There are three main ways to buy things with Lab Funds.

1. UT Buy Card

The easiest is with the UT BuyCard which works like a regular MasterCard. However, items are only allowed to be purchased from APPROVED VENDORS. Even though you can use the credit card anywhere, if you buy from non-approved vendors you will get into trouble and they may take the card away. To find out if a company is an approved vendor, contact the purchasing department. If the company is not an approved vendor, they can add the company. Approved vendors include CDW, Amazon.
After the item has been purchased, a requisition form must be submitted to the purchasing department. It is easiest to edit the form in Acrobat and e-mail the form to Purchasing. 
After the item is received, the packing slip must be sent to Purchasing.

2. Requisition

Alternately, you can simply fill out the requisition form and send to the Purchasing Department. They will place the order.
The disadvantange of this method is that it is slower and less reliable than placing the order yourself.
After the item arrives, the packing slip must be turned in.


3. Buy it with your own money

For many expenses (food, travel) the only choice is to pay for items with your own money, then apply for reimbursement.
Travel expenses are submitted on a special form handled by adminstrative assistants.
Small purchases (< $10) are handled with Petty Cash Vouchers.
Larger purchases (> $10) are handled with Employee Non PO vouchers.
If the check is to be made out to the vendor, then regular Non PO vouchers are used.
