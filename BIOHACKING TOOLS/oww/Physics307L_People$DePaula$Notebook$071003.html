==Electron Diffraction Day 2==
{{SJK comment|label=00:44, 20 October 2007 (CDT)|comment=I know it is obvious now, but you should explain what "inner/inner" etc. mean...as people reading your lab notebook (including you a few weeks from now) would not remember what you were doing.}}
Here is the link to Day 1 Data, which we will use today. [http://openwetware.org/wiki/Physics307L:People/DePaula/Notebook/070926 Day 1 Data]

==I don't know what this is==
{{SJK comment|label=00:42, 20 October 2007 (CDT)|comment=quite interesting.  This should be added to the lab manual, to clarify things.}}
