== Words to Look Up ==
* dioecy
** dioecious
* PAML

== Talk ==

=== Dr Nei's work on evol of sex chromosomes ===
* how scelection can act on a modifier that reduces recomb, including modifiers on sex chrom themselves
* why recomb lost? - sex chromosomes don't recombine
** if sex determined by 2 or more genes - must inheret them together
* how is recomb lost?
* what are consequences of loss of recomb?
** Y gene poor - Y and X homologs and Y has lost
** is genetic degeneration caused by fact that Y heterozygous?
* 'Theory shows that sex chromosomes should evolve low recombination'

=== Why Plant sex chromosomes? ===
* test the theory
* in plants can study how separate sexes evolved
* plant sex chrom evol young
* evol indep many times over
** tell which features found when sex chrom evolve
** maybe more than 100 times
** Darwin noticed
* degeneration processes not affected by prior existence of sex chromosomes
* Darwin noticed - male and female flowers can look very similar - evolved recently and haven't lost redundancy
* Human Y about 1/3 of X - recombine in very small portion of autosomal region that are homologous
* Silene dioica - 230 Mb Y
* Papaya - most sex chrom pseudo-autosomal, and only small portion of Y is male-specific
** very young sex chromosome

=== Why Recomb Lost? ===
* requires several genes
** at least 2 - male and female suppressor genes - one on each chrom (so that don't end up with both and be neuter)
* argument for 2 or more evol steps
* sex determining loci must be initially be linked for separate sexes to evolve
* higher allocation to male function will generally lower female functions
** holly - male (many flowers, female few)
** something about huge pumpkins
