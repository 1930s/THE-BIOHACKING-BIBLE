==Cytoplasmic nucleotide levels==
It is hard to measure the cytoplasmic levels of free NTPs.  Several groups have tried to make these measurements when studying the growth rate dependence of rRNA synthesis <cite>Petersen Gaal</cite>.  Both of these groups calculated nucleotide levels per unit absorbance.  Liang et al.<cite>Liang</cite> used this data to estimate that cytoplasmic ATP levels are in the range of 10mM.  That corresponds to ~1e7 of each nucleotide per cell.  For the moment, I'm going to use this value in my model.
