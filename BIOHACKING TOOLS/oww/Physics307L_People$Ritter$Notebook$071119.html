Electron Diffraction: Day 1

Set up: 

Initial setup followed lab manual. Lab manual says a parallel voltage source is not necessary, but we have heard that it may be necessary to apply 5 - 12V.

Digital calipers borrowed from machine shop. 

We hope to take 10 measurements starting at 5kV and working are way to 2.5kV. This turned out to not be possible. On our original setup visibility was gone completely at 3.1V. We instead took ten measurements from 4.9 - 4.0V.
