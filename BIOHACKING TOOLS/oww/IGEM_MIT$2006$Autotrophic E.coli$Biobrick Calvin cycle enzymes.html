==Background==
*prkA contains a Pst1 site
*rbcL contains an EcoR1 site

==Procedure==
*Miniprep AE4 (this will provide a plasmid prep of both enzymes).
*[[Site-directed mutagenesis]] of the prkA and rbsLS
*Sequence verify that we got mutations
*Cut out the coding regions with primers containing BB ends.
*Clone into BB vector.
