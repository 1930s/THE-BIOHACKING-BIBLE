==Plans==

* I'm interested in using eMedicine to get treatment information on the diseases that we diagnose.  This involves:
** INPUT: disease name
** Searching eMedicine for the disease name
*** How do I get to an interface where I can do this?
** Getting (the right format of) returned information on the disease
*** Can I take it in HTML?  I'm not sure how this site works.  I will email and see if they 
** Parsing the returned information so it's narrowed down to treatment options
*** How do I parse HTML?
** OUTPUT: "Treatment: ..."

* By Tu 4.17:
** Email eMedicine to see if they have:
*** any BioPython-ready stuff 
*** but really, see if there are easy ways to search the site and get data returned in a file format
** If eMedicine's got nothing, I'll start at the back and hope other people can do the front:
*** write parser for the HTML that returns the Treatment options in a file

* By Th 4.19:
** Have talked to other people, and
** Looked at web-interfacing code
*** Hopefully will be able to figure out a way to search the site and get HTML returned, with this help
