 Last day in the Teaching-Lab.
 -We have cleared all our stuff from Fridge and Freezer.
 -All the parts created over the summer are ready to be sent.
 -We still have some stuff stored in the Biochemistry building.
 
 '''Thanks to Farah and John C for helping''' 
 '''And thanks to Sue for provinding such a great support over the all summer.'''

==Minipreps==

*We ran minipreps of all the intermediate parts we wished to send to the registry. From the  [http://openwetware.org/images/0/05/Minipreps_of_intermediate_parts.pdf results] we see that for 023, colony 1 has worked; for 032, colony 1 has worked and colonies 2 and 3 ''may'' have worked; for 12D->2H, colonies 1, 2 and 3 have worked
*7A->3O seems to be an empty vector
*12D->2H seems to be an empty vector
*The plate that read ''Riboswitch Intermediate'' seems to be the same as 12D->24A

*However, Kirsten suggested that 7A->3O and 12D->2H may have worked but we can't see it as the stain has run off...As a check, and to get DNA that we can use for sequencing, we ran minipreps using Kirsten's method. She'll digest them next week and send the parts off for sequencing.

==Preparing Parts to Send to the Registry==

*All the intermediates have been frozen and all parts for the registry are in agar, ready to be sent

==Storage==

*Everything has now been shifted from the teaching lab to the level 6 cold-room in Biochem. All freezer stuff is in the freezer in level 5 opposite the fume cupboards.
