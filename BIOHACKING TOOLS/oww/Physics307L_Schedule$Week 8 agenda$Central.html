==Central Limit Theorem==
===Sum of many independent measurements from the same parent distribution will be normally distributed (Gaussian)===
==Part II==
===Sum of many independent errors from different parent distributions will be normally distributed===
====Example from Millikan oil drop====
====Human reaction time====
====Position of eyeball====
====More?====
==This is why so often random measurement error has a normal distribution==
