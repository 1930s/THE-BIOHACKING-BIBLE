Open peer review journal(s) that accept bioinformatics papers:
* [http://www.biology-direct.com/info/about/ Biology Direct]: reviewers and their reviews are public. See this Nature article: ''[http://www.nature.com/nature/peerreview/debate/op1.html Can 'open peer review' work for biologists? Biology Direct is hopeful.]''

= RSS Feeds =

[http://barf.jcowboy.org/ BaRf] provides RSS feeds for a pretty large number of journals that publish bioinformatics papers.

[http://www.bioinformatics.fr/journals.php Bionformatics.fr] provides impact factor, RSS/Feed address and view at a glance of the articles of the current issue of Bioinformatics journals. More over there is a a Google search engine that enables you to perform a search restricted to these bioinformatics journals
