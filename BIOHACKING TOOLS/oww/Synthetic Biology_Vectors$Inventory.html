==pSB2* Plasmids==
===pSB2K0===
*(also known as [http://www.genome.bnl.gov/Protocols/pscans.shtml pSCANS])
*purpose: inducible copy number plasmid
*problems: contains a PstI site in backbone

===pSB2K3-P1010===
*(formerly known as pSB2K3-1)
*purpose: IPTG-inducible copy number plasmid
*derived from pSB2K0
*constructed by [[User:skosuri | Sri Kosuri]]
*[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:pSB2K3 BioBrick part information]

===pSB2K4-P1010===
*(formerly known as pSB2K4-1)
*purpose: remove many restriction sites from backbone of pSB2K
*Created by a backport from a BioBricks++ plasmid back to a BioBricks cloning site
*Contains terminators on both sides of the cloning site, but also contains two extra restriction sites around the cloning site due to process of construction. Does not affect BioBricks construction in any way.
*Has approximately 2 dozen point mutations in the backbone relative to pSB2K3
*Derived from pREB1.3 from [[User:lchan|Leon]] who removed many of the symmetric restriction sites
*Further mutations were done to make backbone clean for some Type IIs restriction enzymes including: AarI, AcuI, BbsI, BbvCI, BciVI, BsaI, BsmBI, EarI, N.BstNBI, SgrAI
*Plasmid is still inducible and functions similarly to pSB2K3
