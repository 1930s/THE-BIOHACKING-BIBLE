# to the appropriate places in the big grid array. Eventually this will be printed
# in main. Also it needs to be initialized in main. Oligo_path is the path of
# one oligo, while grid_ra is the grid that is constantly being updated until 
# it is printed in main. oligo_num is number that will be inputed to the grid_ra.
