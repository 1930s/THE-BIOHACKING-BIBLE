=RNA Isolation (KPY)=

====Using Invitrogen's [http://www.invitrogen.com/content.cfm?pageid=469 TRIZOL] Reagent====
====For RNA Isolation of Adherent Cells====

==Materials==

*Chloroform
*75% Ethanol
*Isopropyl Alcohol
*RNase-free Water
*TE Buffer
*TRIZOL Reagent

==Procedures==

'''Homogenization'''

#Lyse cells by adding 500 µL of TRIZOL directly to the dish, mixing and passing the cell lysate several times by pipetting.

'''Phase Separation'''

#Incubate the samples for 5 minutes in Eppendorfs at room temperature.
#Add 100 µL of chloroform per 500 µL of TRIZOL.
#Vigorously shake the microcentrifuge tubes by hand for 15 seconds.
#Incubate the tubes for 2 to 3 minutes at room temperature.
#Centrifuge the tubes at 12000 x <i>g</i> for 15 minutes at 4<sup>o</sup>C.

'''RNA Precipitation'''

#Transfer the aqueous phase (60% TRIZOL by volume) to a fresh Eppendorf.
#Add 250 µL of isopropyl alcohol per 500 µL of TRIZOL to precipitate RNA.
#Incubate the tubes for 10 minutes at room temperature.
#Centrifuge the tubes at 12000 x <i>g</i> for 10 minutes at 4<sup>o</sup>C.

'''RNA Wash'''

#Remove the supernatant.
#Resuspend the pellet in 500 µL 75% ethanol per 500 µL TRIZOL and vortex.
#Centrifuge the tubes at 7500 x <i>g</i> for 5 minutes at 4<sup>o</sup>C.

'''Redissolving the RNA'''

#Air dry the RNA pellet and dissolve with TE buffer (200 µL).
#Incubate for up to 10 minutes at up to 60<sup>o</sup>C to dissolve RNA.
#Store at -80<sup>o</sup>C.

==Notes==

*Partially dissolved RNA have an A<sub>260/280</sub> < 1.6.
