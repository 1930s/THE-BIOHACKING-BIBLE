We are part of the [http://www.laserchemistry.adelaide.edu.au/ Laser Chemistry Laboratory] in the [http://www.chemphys.adelaide.edu.au/chemistry/ School of Chemistry and Physics] at the [http://www.adelaide.edu.au/ University of Adelaide].

==Brief Descriptions of Research Projects==
====Nonlinear Imaging of Cell Development====

Second harmonic generation (SHG) and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy are emerging as important noninvasive tools to investigate development of cells. We are interested in using these imaging techniques to study the differentiation of adult mesenchymal stem cells to cardiomyocytes and adipocytes. Additionally, these techniques will be used to quantify the concentrations of myofibrils and triglyceride droplets throughout differentiation.

Collaborator: Dr Janna Morrison, University of South Australia

====Interaction of Curcumin to Surfactant Molecules====

Curcumin is the yellow pigment in the Indian curry spice turmeric. There is an increasing interest in studying this molecule because it exhibits medicinal effects. We investigate the interaction of curcumin to surfactant molecules such as CTAB, SDS, and Triton X-100 using various spectroscopic techniques including absorption, fluorescence, and lifetime measurements.

====Inhibition of Amyloid Fibrils Formation by Curcumin====

Curcumin is known for its anti-amyloid property. "A 2004 UCLA-Veterans Affairs study involving genetically altered mice suggests that curcumin might inhibit the accumulation of destructive beta-amyloid in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients and also break up existing plaques associated with the disease." (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curcumin) We use various spectroscopic techniques to quantify the binding constants of curcumin to amyloid beta peptides at different stages of fibril development.

Collaborator: Prof. John Carver, University of Adelaide

====Ultrafast Intramolecular Hydrogen Transfer in Excited-State Curcumin====

Investigations on the photophysics and photochemistry of Curcumin may elucidate its medicinal effects. Intramolecular hydrogen transfer, which is an important process in curcumin, may play a major role in these effects. We use computational methods to gain insights, including molecular structure of curcumin, energy barrier and time scale of the intramolecular hydrogen transfer process. We use ultrafast spectroscopy to measure the time scale of intramolecular hydrogen transfer.

Collaborators: Assoc. Prof. Trevor Smith, University of Melbourne (Experiment), Assoc. Prof. Mark Buntine, Dr Greg Metha, University of Adelaide (Computational)
