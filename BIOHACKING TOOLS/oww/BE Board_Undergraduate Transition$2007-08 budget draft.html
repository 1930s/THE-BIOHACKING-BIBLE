*"Fund fee": $480
'''Total: $5280'''

==Discussion==
* I bumped up all of Mike's original numbers to reflect the general amount of money the graduate has budgeted for similar events.  In addition, I added a few events to the list that you guys had mentioned have interest in or event that Sasha had previously run with funding through SWE.  You guys are under no obligation to run the events I listed, but on the off chance that you might want to run them or something similar, I would leave them in the budget.  In addition, since this will be the first full year for the undergrad board, there may be new ideas that crop up and I increased the discretionary funds to a total of $1000 for the year.  Feel free to edit away.  --[[User:Amn|Amn]] 14:22, 19 June 2007 (EDT)
