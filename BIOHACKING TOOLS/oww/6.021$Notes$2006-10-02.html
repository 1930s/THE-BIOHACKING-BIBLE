Does simple 4-state model explain characteristics of glucose transport?

* Facilitated (faster than diffusion)
**Enzyme (carrier) binds to solute better than solute dissolves in membrane
* Structure specific
** Different binding constants K for different solutes
* Passive: flow only down concentration gradient
**<math>\phi_s=(\phi_s)_{max} \frac{K}{(K+c_s^i)(K+c_s^o)}(c_s^i-c_s^o)</math>
**So <math>\phi_s > 0</math> only if <math>c_s^i > c_s^o</math>
* Transport saturates
** only finite/fixed number of carrier proteins
** For low concentrations, predicts Fick's law
** <math>\phi_s=\frac{(\phi_s)_{max}}{K}(c_s^i-c_s^o)</math> for small <math>c_s^i, c_s^o</math>
* Transport can be inhibited
** can have active transport by addition of another solute
** for example, adding glucose can change direction of sorbose transport to go against the sorbose gradient
** 4 state model only deals with 1 solute
** can extend to 6 state model to deal with 2 solutes
** 4 inputs: <math>c_s^i,c_s^i,c_r^i,c_r^i</math> and 2 outputs: <math>\phi_s,\phi_r</math>
** same solution for flux <math>\phi_s</math> as before except instead of K have <math>K_{eff}=K_s(1+\frac{c^o_r}{k_r})</math> for inward flux
** can have a different <math>K_{eff}=K_s(1+\frac{c^i_r}{k_r})</math>  for outward flux
** 6 state model is active if <math>\phi_s > 0</math> when <math>c^o_s \ge c_s^i</math>
** This occurs when <math>\frac{K_r+c^o_r}{K_r+c^i_r} > \frac{c_s^o}{c_s^i} \ge 1</math>
** This is called ''secondary active transport'' where concentration gradient of one solute drives the flux of another solute up concentration gradient.
* Pharmacology (drugs)
** modify 6 state model with inhibitors
** competitive inhibitor changes <math>K_{eff}</math> but does not change the maximum flux
** non-competitive inhibitor lowers the maximum flux but leaves <math>K</math> unchanged
* Hormonal control (insulin)
** Causes more transporters to be delivered to the membrane
