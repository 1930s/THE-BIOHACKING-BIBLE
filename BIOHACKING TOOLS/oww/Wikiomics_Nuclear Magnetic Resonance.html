Biological '''Nuclear Magnetic Resonance''' or '''NMR''' is a technique which allows the determination of full or partial 3-dimensional structures of macromolecules. As opposed to [[Wikiomics:X-ray crystallography]], NMR does not require the molecules to be arranged periodically in a crystal and therefore, mixture of molecules in different conformations can be studied dynamically.
