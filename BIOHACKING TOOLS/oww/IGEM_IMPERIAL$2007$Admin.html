== Session Templates ==
=== Briefing & Debriefing ===
* Look at the day's schedule
* Look at pending tasks
* Ask if there were any tasks that were not completed
* Ask if there is anyone with problems for upcoming tasks
* Approve or disapprove any new proposals
* Any other business

Additionally, the debriefing sessions should ask:
* What went well
* What didn't go so well
* What could have been done better, and how

Notes: The chair make statements instead of ask questions (ie, instead of asking what went well, they should begin by saying "I think the... went well today. Does anyone else have anything to add? No? Moving on...")

=== Chair of the week ===
*'''Week 5'''  James
*'''Week 6'''  Lucas
*'''Week 7'''  Peixuan
*'''Week 8'''  Cheuk
*'''Week 9'''  Dirk
*'''Week 10'''  Maira

*'''Responsibilities of the chair:'''
*# Chair the morning brief and debrief
*# Make a daily agenda for the meetings


== Format for Proposals ==
The proposal should satisfy the following statements:
* The project is worthwhile
** It will contribute to the field of synthetic biology and the registry of parts
* The project is relevant to iGEM
** It is an engineering project, not a science project
* The project is sound
** There is real science to back up what the project needs to achieve
** A plan of action to complete the project (fit into the engineering cycle)
** A rough schedule, or at least an indication of time required for each stage of the project
* The group is able to complete the project
** Show an understanding of the lab work required
** Show that literature is available (list references)

A proposed format for the proposal is the following:
* Introduction
** What is the project? (Rough specification)
** Why is it worth pursuing?
** How is it relevant to iGEM?
* Background information and review of literature
** Summarise works relevant to the project
** Outline areas missing literature
* Project plan
** State the project objectives
** Explain how the project will be carried out to meet the objectives
** Break it down into constituent parts
** Identify possible areas of difficulty, and corresponding back-up strategies
** Identify techniques required (lab, modelling, etc.)
* Timeline
** Refer to engineering cycle
** Identify most time-consuming lab activities
** Show when each major stage should be completed by

Notes:
* Whenever possible, be quantitative
* Show understanding of the implications
* Outline the areas that are poorly understood (don't hide them)

=== Graphics Templates ===
We have templates for composing the construct diagrams, based on the same graphics used in the parts registry. We used GIMP and Inkscape, but any other good graphics package should be suitable. You can download the graphics templates [[media:ICGEMS_graphics_pack.zip | here]].

=== Journal Club Presentations ===
