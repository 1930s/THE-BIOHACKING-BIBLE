==Diffusion==
*Most fundamental transport process and the one we understand the best
* Process by which solute is transported from regions of high concentration to low concentration
* Graham made some observations related to diffusion
** Quantity transported is proportional to the initial concentration
** Transport rate slows with time
** Transport of gas is greater than 1000x faster than liquids

===Definitions===
* '''Concentration''': <math>c(x,t)=\lim_{V\rightarrow 0} \frac{amount}{volume}</math>
** But matter isn't discrete, so limit doesn't make sense
** Practically, cells have about <math>\frac{1}{6}\frac{mol}{L}</math> NaCl which is about <math>10^8\frac{molecules}{\mu m^3}</math>
** Cells are greater than <math>1\mu m^3</math> so there are many molecules in a typical cell
** Thus, we'll assume matter is continuous to simplify the math
*'''Flux''': <math>\phi(x,t) = \lim_{A\rightarrow 0 ; \Delta t\rightarrow 0}\frac{amount}{A\Delta t}</math>

==Fick's First Law==
* Adolf Fick (1855) at age 25, came up with Fick's first law by analogy to Fourier's law for heat flow
* <math>\phi(x,t)=-D\frac{\partial c(x,t)}{\partial x}</math>
* We define flux to be positive in same direction as increasing <math>x</math>
* Diffusivitiy units: <math>D=\frac{m^2}{s}</math>
* This is a macroscopic law

==Microscopic basis for diffusion==
* 1828: Robert Brown (Brownian motion)
** Even dead things moved
* Albert Einstein with random walk model
** Assumptions
*** Number of solute much less than number of solvent
*** Only collisions between solute and solvent
** Focus on 1 solute molecule and assume others are statistically identical
** Every <math>\tau</math> seconds, molecule equally likely to move <math>+l</math> and <math>-l</math>
** <math>l=2</math>pm for small molecule (really small length scale)
** From random walk model, easy to derive Fick's first law

<math>\phi(x,t)=-\frac{l^2}{2\tau}\frac{\partial c}{\partial x}</math> so <math>D=-\frac{l^2}{2\tau}</math>
