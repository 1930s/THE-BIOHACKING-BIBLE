*minutes taker

'''Introduction''' 
*(30min)Team Roundtable: names, degrees, nicknames, favourite sport/music/film/book/pet/color etc. tell us something unusual about yourself ?
*(15min)Perspectives on iGEM - what are we aiming for? the moon? what are the prizes/medals?
*need to make contact with team members not here ... let's give them a ring (skype!)


'''Administrative'''

*(5min)Bio21 Access Cards - need to fill in paper work 
*(10min)OpenWetWare Accounts - everyone to apply, can't edit the wiki without it
*(5min)Contact Details - fill in on the wiki ... online chat? AIM/gmail etc... it was useful for us, or just subscribe to wiki watchlist?
*wireless internet connection - need to get financing to dept from Phil, do we want to up the speed back to (1MBit/12GB)???
*(5min)iGEM packs ... suggested
** iGEM rules
** iGEM Kit ... biobricks
** standard assembly
** biology/lab primer: cloning, transformation, culture, miniprep, digest, ligation, pcr, sequence, mutagen etc.
** engineering/modelling primer  
** wiki primer
(the Team to create this ... delegate your first tasks!) - wiki/simple research exercise)


'''Expectations for the year ahead...'''
*Preliminary Timetable
**Dec-Jan-Feb - heavy brainstorm/research
**Jan-Feb - Begin Lab work (prelim)
**end of Feb - project finalised, order parts from registry or other labs, start modelling
**Feb - start creating timeline/plan of when things should happen (or do this earlier)
**Mar-Apr - start the hardcore lab, modelling
**May - iGEM seminar (register team/project)
**Jun-Jul - more lab and modelling
**Aug-Sep - more lab and modelling... hopefully finishing most things by now ... making sure wiki is up-to-date
**Oct - send DNA to MIT, finish wiki
**Nov - go to Jamboree


'''Team Dyanmics'''
*[[http://www.scribd.com/doc/492210/Effective-Team-Dynamics| Effective Team Dynamics]] - have a read ... some good stuff if you wish to use it...
*(30min)OGSM framework - objectives / goals / strategies / measurements : up to you if you want to use it... 
** objectives - make finals/win the biobrick/ 
** goals - solve a specific medical/environmental/energy problem / 1000 submitted biobricks / extensive modelling
** strategies - proposed actions to achieve goals
***brainstorm, research, plan, work, pray, go to jamboreee!!!
** measurements - 
***1/3 month review ... measure progress
***how is the wiki being maintained... standard wiki processes for creating new pages etc.
***is the lab work productive/ is the work load spread out
***create a time line ... of what you hope to achieve when ... give yourself deadlines [very rough at first], and review when you come to them ... 
***this is likely to be a complex construction timeline... do you want to use Project/Gantt charts ie find critical path etc, who will do this ??? it def would have been useful for us ... since things were just always being pushed back
