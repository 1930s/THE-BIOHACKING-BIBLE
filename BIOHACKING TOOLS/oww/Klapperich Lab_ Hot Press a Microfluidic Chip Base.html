==Overview==

Use a mechanical hot press to create the base to which a microfluidic chip with channels can be bonded.

==Materials==

*Mechanical Hot Press
*Zeonex beads
*2 Removable nickel plates 

==Procedure==
#Set the temperature of Platen 1 and 2 of the Hot Press to be around 330&deg;F.
#Center a circular arrangement of Zeonex beads on one of the nickel plates.
#Place the nickel plate onto the bottom Platen of the Hot Press, and carefully place the other nickel plate on top without disrupting the arrangement of Zeonex beads. 
#Pump the hydralic pressure handle until the platens touch and the pressure reading remains 0, and then wait 1 minute. This time allows the plastic to begin to warm and melt.
#Pump the hydralic handle until it reads 1000 psi.
#Hot press for 5 minutes. 
#Remove and let cool.
