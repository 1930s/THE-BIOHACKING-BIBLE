==To Do List==
*Figure out the MATLAB memory leak
**I suspect this is because I'm not closing the image files properly in the MATLAB script that runs, or it could be something more annoying.
**Does the leak influence the timing of the events, by making the image processing take too long?  (e.g. why does the timing graph get noisy after awhile?)
**Is it the MATLAB thread that blows up or the LabView? it's MATLAB.
**[http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1100/1106.html MATLAB help page here might be useful.]
*output the direction of sorting to the output file
*Clean up the Image Processing MATLAB scripts

==Done==
*Why do I see any variability in the timing? Timing between cleaning events is rock solid, the timing between sorts is influenced by the time it takes to process the image.
*Change the code so that when flipping based on the CFP it is the moving average that is used, rather than a single image.
*Make the list of experiments to evaluate the device performance limits.
**Sorting at various dilution rates, followed by a sort to extinction.

===Future Experiments===
'''replace bulb before these experiments'''
*check on pH of the media if we are adding AHL, it needs to be <8 for AHL to be stable.
*Zig-zag run where we vary from 0.4 to 0.6 so that we can get more sampling of the selective pressure.
*Maintenance of a slower growing variant vs. a faster growing "mutant".
**Could demonstrate this with a slower growing CFP vs YFP or via something like F2620.
*Zig-zag experiment with different dilution rate (e.g. different total number of cells).
*Get the exact size of sorting chamber by cell counting
*F2620 is in MG1655 whose flagella might cause a problem
**Need to co-transform with RFP expression plasmid anyway.
*We already have the zig-zag automated, but should include a "pulse" as well (e.g. /-\_/-\) where it has regions with no selection.

==Modeling==
*[[Sortostat/Model]]
*How much faster can we drive it given the timing?
*Are there more or less cells in a sort vs a screen?
**No, looked at this before last lab meeting, but should write it up.
*Do fluctuations in the total cell count correlate with anything?
*2/18/06 lab notebook page has some information about the appropriate sorting volume to use in the model, move this to the wiki

===Output===
*Sortostat mFiles doc - list of all the mfiles that matter (except the image processing).  These are all commented and cleaned up at this point. 
*Sortostat Modeling Probability Distributions doc - description of the modeling of the probability distributions for the number of cells in the sorting chamber and how many are CFP or YFP.
*Sortostat Modeling Stochastic Sim doc - description of the stochastic simulation of Sortostat performance.

===Analytical model===
*put the cleaning period / dilution rate formula derivations on the wiki.
*write up the chemostat equations as they relate to the SS cell concentration (e.g. limiting substrate?  Should we reduce the concentration of glycerol?)
*These come from the SortostatTiming.m matlab model:
**12.5 min between cleaning (doubling time = 0.55)
**13.6 min between cleaning (doubling time = 0.60)
**14.8 min between cleaning (doubling time = 0.65)
**15.9 min between cleaning (doubling time = 0.7)
**17min between cleaning (doubling time = 0.75)
**18.2min between cleaning (doubling time = 0.8)
**19.3min between cleaning (doubling time = 0.85hr)
**20.5min between cleaning (doubling time = 0.9hr)
**21.6min between cleaning (doubling time = 0.95hr)
**22.7min between cleaning (doubling time = 1hr)
**23.9min between cleaning (doubling time = 1.5hr)

==LabView==
*why do we need to initialize the load paraemters array?
