Hints from a technician in the Endy lab: Basic plasticware (gloves, pipette tips, eppendorf tubes) we get from [[http://www.bioexpress.com ISC Bioexpress]].  They are by far the cheapest but to get those prices you have to deal with the company rep. who issues a price quote.  USA Scientific (a sister company of Eppendorf) is also a good source for tubes, tips, and racks, and the lower prices are available through ecat3 on MIT's ecat.  A lot of people simply use the VWR stockroom in [[http://whereis.mit.edu/map-jpg?mapterms=56&mapsearch=go Building 56]] and just go and buy what they need as they need it.  You can also just start signing up for accounts with different companies online and start requesting their catalogs so you can get a feel for what they offer. With most companies you can also use Purchase Orders if you prefer or order through webpages with a credit card.  Eric has an MIT credit card.
