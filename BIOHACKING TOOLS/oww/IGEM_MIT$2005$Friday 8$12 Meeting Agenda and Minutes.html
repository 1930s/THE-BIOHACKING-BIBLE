==General Updates==
*Biobricks request: please have up on wiki by end of today.
*Today: clean up in Kate's lab after lunch; spend rest time learning about lab space, doing lab duties, and organizing our stuff.  Visualize a white tornado!
*Lets talk lab-use

==SubTeam Updates==

Format: what is the progress? what are the issues?

===Input: Maxine===
*<font size = 4>Subtilis</font>
**<font size = 4>Advantages</font>
***Is naturally competent (saves us time!)
**<font size = 4>Disadvantages</font>
***According to "The Permeability of the Wall Fabric of E. Coli and Bacillus subtilis," 
****E. coli and Subtilis pore size: 25kDa
****E. coli pore size (according to many other sources) 6Da
****Our fluorescein constructs: ~8-16 kDa
***The Com system in Subtilis degrades double stranded DNA and then resynthesizes one strand, so our fluorescein construct would not work
***We need to relearn all lab techniques, i.e. plating, etc. because of its different properties, such as pore production
***We need to remake much of the ToxR system (different promoters and ribosome binding sites) so that it can fit into subtilis
**Conclusion: advantages not enough to outweight disadvantages at this point
*<font size = 4>Most of the week was spent on helping FecA system</font>

===Receiver/Transmitter 1 - ToxR : Wiki-Will===

*Activity:
 -J07011 (ctx::gfp) might be correct, c/o gel test. Then again, it might not be. (see picture)
 
 -J07009 is here! 
 Initial assembly attempts - J13002::J07009, J07009::J07006, J07009::J07043, J07009::J07044, J07009::J07045
                     promotor, rbs :: ToxR     ToxR::malE      ToxR::scFv(i)   ToxR::scFv(ii)  ToxR::scFv(iii)
 Every single plate of assemblies showed no growth this morning. I wonder what went wrong! can we back-track? 
 my women's intuition tells me it was the transformation.
 
 -Some troubling news shows up in our Gel Purify of J07009. The picture implies J07009 (cut x/p) is ~1kb, and it should bee ~650kb

*This Weekend (team effort): 
 - Retry Assemblies / retry transformation
 - At the very least: miniprep large amounts of each biobrick being used right now.

===Receiver/Transmitter 2 - FecA : Annie===
*Updates 
 -QuikChange done on FecR, PhoA --> preparing to get them sequence
  FecA didn't get any colonies
 -BB FecA Promoter
  However, gel on digest shows lots of other bands
 -Recieve all primers reordered
 -Ligating RBS & FecI
 -Primers for PCR Tetracycline and Chloramphenicol resistance form hairpins and dimers
  Consistent with gel bands
*Questions
 -Discuss the FecA Promoter gel bands with an advisor
 -Only 1 internal primer or both forward & reverse for sequencing?
 -Design new primers for PCR Tetracycline and Chloramphenicol? 
  Any other ways?

No new updates.

==Issues/Discussion==
#Subtilis seems not particularly useful for us, although it might still be an option.
#Registry might want to think about subtilis as another organism to pay attention to
#Jenny's stuff needs to be passed on. Probably to Jen.
#Will: need to figure out what is happening with ToxR. Need assemblies to work!
#FecA System: Can do quick change on subparts of the FecA gene (2.3 kb). Can do not quickchange method, talk to Kate, she did this before.
#Change digest protocol... in general, lets look over our protocols
#Use program that helps design primers
#Issues with adding in the signal processing device:
##How many plasmids can stay in the cell?
##*Drug markers
##*compatibility of replication origins
##Levels of expression on plasmids
##Plasmids wont support infinitely long insert -- not longer than 10 kb
#Issue of load
#Lets do a System Integration Meeting
