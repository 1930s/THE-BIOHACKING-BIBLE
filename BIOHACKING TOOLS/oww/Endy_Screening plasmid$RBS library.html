==Design==
Can vary the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence or the spacing between the SD and the start codon.  If we're going to use oligo synthesis it will be easier to vary the SD to make a very large library.  Alternatively we could make a small library with different spacing by simply synthesizing each one.

==Experimental approach==
#Combine Heather's RBSs to make a library
#*This might be an easy way to get a library of RBSs that are known to work (and in this case ready to be characterized as well).
#Synthesize an oligo library (would only vary the SD in this case, not the spacing).
