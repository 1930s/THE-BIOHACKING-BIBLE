 '''Transformation Protocol for Arabidopsis'''            Method modified from Clough and Bent (1988)       
 
Plant material: 
• Thinly sow Arabidopsis thaliana cv C24 seed into soil.  Grow at 20°C 
under 16h light until plants are beginning to flower.  Cut off any seed 
pods that have formed prior to transformation. 
 

Prepare bacteria: 
• Streak YM plus antibiotic plates with bacteria, or Minimal A plus 
antibiotic plates for Agrobacterium. 
• Incubate plates for 2-3 days at 28°C. 

 
Transformation: 
• Measure about 20mL Infiltration Medium for each bacterial strain. 
• Scrape or wash bacteria from plate with sterile loop and suspend in 
20mL of Infiltration media. 
• Adjust density to an OD600 0.9-1.0. 
• Dip flowers and unopened buds of Arabidopsis into the bacterial 
suspension, or alternatively the plants can be sprayed with bacterial 
suspension using a plant mister. 
• Cover plants to maintain humidity overnight.  Grow at 20°C in light. 
• Repeat dipping/spraying after 7 days. 
• Collect seed, store at 4°C 
 

Selection: 
• Weigh seed to estimate number (100 seed ≈ 21.8mg) 
• Sterilise for 2 mins in 70% (v/v) ethanol followed by 20 mins in 20% 
(v/v) bleach (Zixo brand) + 0.02% Triton X-100.  Keep the seeds 
moving in the bleach solution by putting tubes on a rotator wheel. 
• Wash seeds 5 times with sterile distilled water (in laminar flow hood) 
• Plate to Germination Medium + selection plates, seal with Micropore 
tape.  
• Incubate overnight at 4°C then in light at 20°C.  After 10 days select 
transformants, transplant to soil.
