It's time for our annual lab clean up.  Due to the stellar job we did last year, hopefully this should take less than three hours to complete this year.  Please indicate all times that you are available here (goal is to find a single time slot that everyone can attend, but I will settle for a day where everyone can attend either in the morning or the afternoon):
