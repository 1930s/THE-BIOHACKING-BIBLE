*For Nucleic acids:

#Turn on the software by clicking on the icon. (Note: there is no ON/OFF switch on the instrument)  Choose  your “User” folder for storage of your data.
#The first panel allows for the selection of the required analysis and the “Nucleic Acid” button is on the top left of the screen.
#The Module startup panel comes up on the screen. For this step, the pedestals are cleaned and a water sample is loaded in order to initialize the instrument. Refer to the manual for illustration of how to load the samples (page 3-1).
#In order to prepare a report of all readings, the “Recording” button must be  pressed. The report can log either 12 or 32 measurements.
#Choose “DNA, “RNA” or other analysis before doing the “blank” measurement.
#Before making measurements, a blank must be measured and stored. Place a fresh sample of RNase Free water on the pedestal and press “Blank”.  Then place a fresh sample on the pedestal and enter “Blank” as the sample name.  A straight line should appear on the screen. If this baseline is not flat repeat the “Blank” measurement until it is. Clean the pedestals between readings with a Kimwipe. [Note: the measurement cycle takes about 10 seconds and is accompanied by some clicking sounds]
#Samples can now be measured and stored. The sample names can be recorded in the window and will be indicated on the report page.
#Remove the sample from the pedestals using a Kimwipe.  The pedestals can also be wiped with a  wet Kimwipe and then dried between samples.
#The “PrintScreen” button will give a printout of the spectrum of the sample from the attached printer but makes a large image and uses lots of toner!!!
#The “Show Report”  button will display all the readings associated with the current report. There are 3 options within this window..Save – saves the report as a .jpg; Print – prints the report to the default printer; Exit – returns to the specific application module.
#The “Re-blank” option establishes a new reference which is used for the  calculations of all subsequent samples.
#The “Exit” command closes all the application modules and supporting options. After clicking the ‘Exit’ button the user has 10 seconds to cancel the command…if no action is taken, the command is carried out. Note: All measurement data is automatically saved to an archive file and requires no user action.
#Always clean the pedestals after all samples are read and do a measurement on a fresh replicate of the blanking solution to confirm that the pedestal is clean.
