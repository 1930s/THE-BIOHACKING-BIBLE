Miniprep procedure for large, low-copy plasmids
==Materials==
==Procedure==
===Lysis===
* Set up an overnight culture in 40 mL [[Griffitts:Common media#LB Broth (1 L)|LB broth]]
* Centrifuge for 8 min at 8000 rpm
* Resuspend in 2.5 mL of [[Griffitts:Common buffers#resuspension buffer|resuspension buffer]]
* Add 2.5 mL of [[Griffitts:Common buffers#lysis solution|lysis solution]]
===DNA Isolation===
* Add 2.5 mL of [[Griffitts:Common buffers#neutralization solution|neutralization solution]]
* Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 8 min
* Transfer 6.5 mL of supernatant to 15-mL Falcon tube
* Add 50 μL of [[Griffitts:Common buffers#RNAse A|RNAse A]]
* Let sit at RT for 5 min
* Add 6.5 mL of isopropanol
* Incubate at -20°C for 30 min
* Centrifuge in clinical (yellow) centrifuge for 10 min at max speed
* Pour off supernatant 
* Resuspend pellet in 1 mL 70% ethanol
* Centrifuge for 5 min in clinical centrifuge (yellow) at max speed
* Discard supernatant
===Qiagen Miniprep===
* Resuspend DNA pellet in 250 μL of Buffer P1
** The P1 is kept in the fridge
** Make sure to use P1 that has RNAse added
* Add 250 μL of Buffer P2
* Immediately invert 3 times
* Let stand for 2 minutes
* Add 350 μL of Buffer N3
* Immediately invert 8 times
* Keep on ice for 5 min
* Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 6 min in microfuge
* Carefully move the supernatant (~820 μL) to a spin column
* Centrifuge for 30 seconds at full speed
* Remove flowthrough
* Add 700 μL of wash buffer PE to column
* Centrifuge for 30 seconds at full speed
* Remove flowthrough
* Centrifuge for another 60 seconds at full speed
* Move column to a labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube
* Add 70 μL TE (preheated to 65°C) directly to disk
** Don't touch the membrane with your tip
**Note that TE must be added to the column hot for efficient elution of large (20 kb) plasmids
* Let stand 1-2 minutes
* Centrifuge for 60 seconds at full speed to elute DNA
