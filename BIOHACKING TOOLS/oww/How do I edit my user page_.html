To edit your userpage, you should first make sure that you have changed the abstract template correctly.  You should change the line that says: 
'''<nowiki>[[Special:Mypage|your_full_name]]  </nowiki> '''

so that it becomes: '''<nowiki>[[User:my_oww_user_name|My_Full_Name]].</nowiki>  ''' Where you have replaced '''my_oww_user_name''' with your OWW username, and '''My_Full_Name''' with your full name.
