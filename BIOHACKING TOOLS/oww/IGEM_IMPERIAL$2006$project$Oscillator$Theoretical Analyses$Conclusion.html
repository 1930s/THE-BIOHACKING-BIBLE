=='''Conclusion'''==

<font size="4"> '''Overview of our Results on the Molecular Predation System'''</font size="4"> 
:* We haven't carried out the full study of the 3D model of Molecular Predation System
:* Instead we have used some biologically justifiable hypotheses to simplify the model to a 2D model
:* We have also carried out a complete theoretical study of the 2D system and are now able to predict for every combination of parameters how the '''Molecular Predation System''' will behave.
:* In particular we have proved that the Molecular Predation System can operate in two modes:
::- It can work as an oscillator (oscillating around unique limit cycle)
::- It can work in stable regime (both prey and predator populations converge to limit value)


<font size="4"> '''What was learnt from modifying the model'''</font size="4">
:* Oscillations are the results of a subtle balance between the growth terms and degradation terms of the system.
:* Oscillations appeared to be mainly due to balancing the growth and degradation terms of the preys
:* The washout terms in the model were crucial to control the system

<font size="4"> '''Control of the Oscillations of the Molecular Predation Oscillator'''</font size="4"> 
<br>
Control of the oscillations is not as simple as with Lotka-Volterra, but simulations show that we have '''good control over the amplitude''' and '''total control over the frequency''' as shown below.

== '''Future Works''' ==
<font size="4">'''Future Works on the 2D Model'''</font size="4">
:* The normalised 2D model of the molecular predation oscillator has been extensively studied.
:* Some more work on the oscillator still needs doing however
:* The most important work remaining on the normalised 2D model concerns the characterisation of the output of the oscillator with regards to the model parameters
::- '''Amplitude'''
::- '''Frequency'''
::- '''Profile''' (measures of shape in phase diagrams or time diagrams) 
:* To be complete the characterisation should also be dome with the experimental constraints in mind (e.g: washout cannot be infinitely small)

<br>

<font size="4">'''Extensions to the 2D Model'''</font size="4">
:* The model of the molecular predation oscillator overlooks the leakage terms and does not comprise any exponent in the growth terms.
:* With these new terms the dimensionless model would look like

<center><font size="3"> Generalised 2D Model    </font size="3">[[Image:Model-2Dgeneralised.pngâ€Ž]]</center>

:* These assumptions are reasonable a first sight. However, some preliminary results (available in '''[[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2006/project/Oscillator/Theoretical Analyses/Future Works| Future Works on the 2D Model]]''') suggest that the oscillator is very sensitive to the assumption on the exponent.
:* We therefore suggest carrying out a thorough analysis of the extended model next year
<br>

<font size="4">'''Future Works on the 3D Model'''</font size="4">
:* We only studied the case when d1=d2 and thus simplified the 3D model into 2D
:* At the very least the study should be extended to the vicinity of d1=d2
:* Ideally the whole 3D system would be studied
:* NB: the '''complexity''' of the study '''will increase dramatically'''
::- Making sure steady points are unstable is not enough
::- We need a solid criterion on how to get a cycle
<br>
<font size="4">'''Stochastic Analysis'''</font size="4">
:* What is the influence of the distributions of gene-expression parameters such as ao,bo,co?
:* We may in practice need to drop the Dynamical System approach and go fully stochastic
:* An '''entirely new level of complexity'''!!!!!
