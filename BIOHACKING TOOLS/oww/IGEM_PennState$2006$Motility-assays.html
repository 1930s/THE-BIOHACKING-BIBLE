*LB
*Typtone broth plates
*Cells (from plate)

===<font color="green">Day 1: Make Tryptone Swarm Plates</font>===
1. For each plate to be made, add the following to a 125mL flask:
*0.25g Bacto tryptone
*0.20g NaCl
*0.15g sodium citrate
*0.05g Eiken agar (for a 0.20% agar swarm plate)

2. Add 25mL purified water to the flask and swirl to dissolve

3. Autoclave 25 minutes with slow exhaust

4. Upon cooling, add appropriate antibiotics and inducers

*IPTG saturation concentration => 1mM
*HSL saturation concentration => 100µM 

5. Allow plates to dry overnight

===<font color="green">Day 1: Inoculate O'N Culture</font>===
1. Inoculate 3mL overnight cultures of all samples to be tested

2. Shake at 200 RPM in 30°C incubator

===<font color="green">Day 2: Assay</font>===
1. Dilute overnight culture 1:100 in LB (30uL of culture in 3mL LB)

2. Grow in a 30°C incubator at 200 RPM to an A590nm O.D. between 0.3-0.4

3. Add about 3uL of each culture to plates

4. Grow in a 30°C incubator 8 hours 

5. Take picture of plate with digital camera
