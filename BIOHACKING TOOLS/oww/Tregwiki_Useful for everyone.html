A Wiki on Transcription Regulation is important.

It's useful for your work:

* When pubmed'ing: Unlike pubmed, our wiki will only treat work that concerns us.
* When writing articles: You can quickly find and quote related work and can calm down reviewers.
* When searching: Quickly find out if there is a website for your problem.
* When evaluating: If several resources exists, comments indicate if they are good.
* When being bored: You can discuss with other people that face the same problems as you.
* When being frustrated by your supervisor: You can vent your anger by criticizing the work of strangers instead of your supervisor's one... :-)
