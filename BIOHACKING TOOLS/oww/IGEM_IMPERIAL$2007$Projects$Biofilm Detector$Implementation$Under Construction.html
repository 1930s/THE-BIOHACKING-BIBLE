==Beta-Galactosidase Assay==
Note: seeing that the beta-galactosidase assay cannot be used due to size restrictions ''in vitro'', the second possibility - alkaline phosphatase [[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_J61032 BBa_J61032]] is currently being considered.  Also, DsRed Express can also be used.

The gene ''lacZ'' encodes for the enzyme ß-galactosidase, which naturally hydrolyzes lactose to glucose and galactose. ß-galactosidase can also hydrolyze lactose homologues to give chromophores. We will be using o-nitrophenyl-ß-galactoside as a substrate for ß-galactosidase, which can be hydrolyzed to a chromophore which absorbs at 420 nm (575 nm for CPRG).

=====Z-Buffer=====
*60 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>
*40 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>
*10 mM KCl
*1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>
*50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol
#Adjust the pH to 7.0 with 10 M NaOH 
#Add 4 mg/mL o-nitrophenyl-β-D-Galactoside (ONPG)
#Store at 4&deg;C, is it recommended that ONPG is added prior to use to prevent spontaneous hydrolysis

=====Stop Solution=====
*1 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> 

=====Protocol=====
#Cells should be lyzed by specific technique
#Incubate cell lysate at 30&deg;C for 10 minutes
#Add ~1000 &micro;l Z-buffer with ONPG and note the starting time
#Add ~500 &micro;l stop solution and note the ending time
#Transfer solution to cuvette and measure absorbance at 420 nm
#*Absorbance should ideally be from 0.6 to 0.9#
#*Cell debris can interfere at 420 nm; cell debris absorbance can be measured at 550 nm<br>Centrifuging the sample can reduce cell debris
#*Cell count measurement at 600 nm can also give more accurate calibration

=====Notes=====
[Do we use ONPG (Sigma N1127) or the more sensitive CPRG (Sigma 59767)?]<br>
ONPG has a extinction coefficient of 4500 M<sup>-1</sup>cm<sup>-1</sup><br>

The protocols for the ß-galactosidase assay can be found in [[Beta-Galactosidase_Assay_(A_better_Miller)|A Better Miller]].<br>
Alternatively, another protocol can be found at [http://rothlab.ucdavis.edu/protocols/beta-galactosidase-3.html Rothlab].

*If high levels of B-galactosidase are being assayed add 0.1ml of culture to 0.9ml of Z buffer 
*If low levels are being determined add 0.5 ml of culture to 0.5ml of Z buffer
*OD<sub>420</sub> = 1.75 x OD<sub>550</sub>
