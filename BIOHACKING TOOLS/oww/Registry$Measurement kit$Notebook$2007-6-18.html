*It appears that there was no growth on yesterday's transfer plates.
==Plan for today==
#Bag those tet/chlor plates before they dry out (done)
#Try the transformation again with the old ligation using the new plates (done)
#Re-do the 3-way ligation, using different backbones (i.e., ones with tet, kan, chlor resistance, where applicable) (done)
#Transform the above (done)
#Check/update labels on the digest products (done)
#start a culture of each of top10 and mg1655 (done)

==3-way ligation==
*see [[Nmbhat:3-way ligation|protocol]]
===Promoter tester with RFP===
*2 ligation reactions:
**B0032 (E/S) + J04650 (X/P) + 1AT3 (E/P)
**B0032 (E/S) + J04650 (X/P) + 1AC3 (E/P)
*internally: Device A/2+4, labelled in green with relevant antibiotic resistance (T,C)
===RBS tester with GFP===
*3 reactions:
**R0040 (E/S) + I13401 (X/P) + 1AK3 (E/P)
**R0040 (E/S) + I13401 (X/P) + 1AT3 (E/P)
**R0040 (E/S) + I13401 (X/P) + 1AC3 (E/P)
*internally: Device B/1+3, labelled in black (K,T,C)
===RBS tester with RFP===
*2 reactions:
**R0040 (E/S) + J04650 (X/P) + 1AT3 (E/P)
**R0040 (E/S) + J04650 (X/P) + 1AC3 (E/P)
*internally: Device C/1+4, labelled in blue (T,C)
===Transformation===
*Each reaction above was transformed into a culture of MG1655.
==Cell culture==
*Procedure:
#Touch pipet tip to cell colony
#Eject tip into tube with 5mL LB
#Let grow overnight at 37Â°C
==For tomorrow==
*Check on MG1655/top10 cultures
*Check on both transformation attempts
