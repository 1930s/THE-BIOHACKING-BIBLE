Estimated half-life:

The N-terminal of the sequence considered is M (Met).

The estimated half-life is: 
*30 hours (mammalian reticulocytes, in vitro).
*>20 hours (yeast, in vivo).
*>10 hours (Escherichia coli, in vivo).


Instability index:

The instability index (II) is computed to be 11.46
This classifies the protein as stable.



Aliphatic index: 88.28

Grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY): -0.126
