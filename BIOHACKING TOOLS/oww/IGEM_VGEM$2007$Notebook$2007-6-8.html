*Making Glycerol Stock of GFP transformed cells
#We verified the expression of GFP in our cells.  It was a great moment in the dark Wilsdorf closet.
#We made a 50:50 cell to glycerol solution and stored it in the minus 20C. 
#We plated another 200uL of cells onto Amp+ plates.  We hope to have more colonies on this plate.

Protocol:
Making glycerol stock for long term storage:

   1. Add 1 ml of 40% glycerol in H2O to a cryogenic vial.
   2. Add 1 ml sample from the culture of bacteria to be stored.
   3. Gently vortex the cryogenic vial to ensure the culture and glycerol is well-mixed.
         1. Alternatively, pipet to mix.
   4. On the side of the vial list all relevant information - part, vector, strain, date, researcher, etc.
   5. Store in a freezer box in a -80C freezer. Remember to record where the vial is stored for fast retrieval later.


Note:  We were sucessful in transforming our cells with the biobrick
