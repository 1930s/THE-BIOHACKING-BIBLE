==Media test==
*The '''aim''' of this test was to see if the fluorescence of GFP mut3b gets affected by the media it is in. 
*We tested the reporter's expression in nuclease free water and LB media and then compared it with the reults got from GFP mut3b calibration curve
*The results can be found [[Media:IC 2007 Mediatest.xls|here]] 
*It was found a linear relationship between the fluorescence of GFP mut3b in the three media.
*This meant that LB media could be used to get calibration curve for dsRED express instead of cell extract. But as dsRED express couldn't be cloned, we didn't make a calibration curve for dsRED express

==pT7 test in-vitro==
*The '''aim''' of the test was to see if pT7-GFP mut3b and pT7-dsRED express work in-vitro or not
*The protocols can be found [[IGEM:here|here]]
*The experiment didn't give good results as:
**The incubator had been turned off, thus the samples were not at the right temperature.
**The right filter for dsRED express was not used to begin with
*After using the right filter, it was realised that pT7-dsRED express construct doesn't express
*The results can be found [[IGEM:here|here]]
