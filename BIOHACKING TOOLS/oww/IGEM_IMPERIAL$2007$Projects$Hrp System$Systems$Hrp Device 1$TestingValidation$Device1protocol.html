===Promoter Test Construct===
The promoter pLux is to be tested at 8 varying ranges of inducer concentration and each conbcentration will haev 4 repeats.
*pLux will have a range of 0 to 100μM  AHL added at intervals of 12.5μM [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Projects/Hrp System/Systems/Hrp Device 1/TestingValidation/Protocolplux| Protocol]]

===Device Test Construct===
For this test construct we initially need to run a preliminary test in order to find out the time intervals and input ranges we need. We will start the preliminary test using the range of concentrations used initially for promoters.
This device uses a pLac promoter, the proposed range of concentrations is going to be defined from the promoter experiment, this is use a range of concentrations to cover an appropriate range of promoter. From looking at literature an appropriate range is 0-100μM.

*Once the data range has been adjusted then carry out the test construct protocol. Click here for the[[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Projects/Hrp System/Systems/Hrp Device 1/TestingValidation/Device1| device protocol]]
