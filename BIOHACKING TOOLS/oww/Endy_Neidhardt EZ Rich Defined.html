See the main [[Neidhardt EZ Rich Defined]] for full details on how we make this media.  

The kitchen makes up the 10X MOPS mixture for us.  Here is the protocol - 

==Making 1 L 10x MOPS mixture==
#Add 300ml deionized, sterile H<sub>2</sub>O to a 1 L beaker.
#Add 83.72 g MOPS <-order more of this
#Add 7.17 g Tricine
#Add 10M KOH to a final pH of 7.4 (10 to 20 ml) <-make sure the kitchen has a stock of this.  They don't seem to have it anymore.  Also, they don't have a pH meter so they need to use the Sauer labs for this.
#Add 0.14 g FeSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O to 50 ml of deionized, sterile H<sub>2</sub>O
#Add 10 ml of the FeSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O to the MOPS/Tricine solution.
#Add 50 ml 1.9 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl
#Add 10 ml 0.276 M K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
#Add 0.25 ml 0.02 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O
#Add 2.1 ml 2.5 M MgCl<sub>2</sub>
#Add 100 ml 5 M NaCl
#Add 0.2 ml Micronutrient stock
#Add 387 ml H<sub>2</sub>O
#Filter sterilize with a 0.2 micron filter.  The kitchen doesn't have these, we need to bring one.  They do have a vacuum line.
#Aliquot into 100 or 200 ml bottles and freeze at -20C.
