Markus K. Muellner was born in Austria in 1977. His interest in science sparked at the age of 10 with his first book on Dinosaurs and has finally led him to pursue a career in the life sciences (albeit not in paleontology). He made a doctoral thesis on hypoxia signaling/HIF-1 alpha and oxidative stress and is now trying to get his feet wet on genomic screens and other exciting projects in the Nijman Lab.
