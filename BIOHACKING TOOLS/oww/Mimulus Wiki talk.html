==What is on the Mimulus Community Wiki page?==
*Let's check out [[Mimulus Community]]

==Why do we want to learn about the Wiki?==
#It is an easy way for everyone to communicate about their research
#Todd Vision is going to use a Wiki for analysis of the genome 
#We are the first hit on Google for "Mimulus Community" (and the 6th hit for "Mimulus")

==Okay, so how do we edit the Wiki page?==
#Check out the [[Help:Contents|help contents]]
#Take the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Tutorial Wikipedia tutorial]] and play in the sandbox

==What are some of things that I can do with my wiki page?==
#Do wild formating 
#Create links to favorite websites
#Upload and download useful spreadsheets 
#Put pdfs and images on Wiki pages
#Help the Mimulus community better know what is out there!

==Okay, I want to get started.  What should I do?==
*Contact [[David Lowry]] and ask to become a user.

==What about this dewikify thing?==
*It's in the works.  In the meantime, it would be best if all new pages are created with the heading "Mimulus:Name." That way it will be easier to have everything become dewikified at once.

==What is OpenWetWare?==
It was founded by a group of scientists at MIT.  The overall idea is open source biology that can easily be shared by all scientists.  An article about its development can be found [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v441/n7094/full/441678a.html here].
