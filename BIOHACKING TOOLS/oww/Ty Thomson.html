==Personal==
===Bio===
Born in Toronto in 1979.  Grew up there, and attended the [http://www.utoronto.ca University of Toronto] (UofT, not to be confused with UT, which is some school in texas I hear).  Graduated in 2002 with a BASc (BASc = bachelor of applied science = canadian engineering degree) in Biomedical Engineering from the [http://www.engsci.utoronto.ca/ Engineering Science] program.  For 3 summers in undergrad I worked for MDS Proteomics (which changed names to Protana Inc, and was bought out by [http://www.transitiontherapeutics.com/ Transition Therapeutics]). I started grad school at [http://web.mit.edu/ MIT] in [http://web.mit.edu/be Biological Engineering] (BE) in the fall of 2002.  In January of 2003 I joined [[Drew Endy]]'s lab.  I mainly joined his lab cause he seemed to be the craziest and most outside-of-the-box faculty member in BE.  I have been loosely involved in the synthetic biology community here (although my research is not really synth bio related), including the sythetic biology working group, and I helped organize [http://syntheticbiology.org/Synthetic_Biology_1.0.html Synthetic Biology 1.0].  I am somehow on the OWW steering committee, despite the fact that I rarely use OWW.  I seem to be the skeptic/realist in the group, which is needed 'cause I work with a bunch of optimistic hippies.
