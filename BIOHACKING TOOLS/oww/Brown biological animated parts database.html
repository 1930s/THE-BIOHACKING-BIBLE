Sometimes, presenting molecular biology can be just as hard researching it. Pictures can help to make it easier and can serve their purpose - to give a simplified visual representation - but they have their limits as well. Sometimes with their over-simplification, we can lose sight of the context in which the machinery is all happening. We see presentations moving in the direction of 3D animations, not as a replacement but a complement to 2D illustrations.

This is why we're creating a database of creative commons animated parts.  If you want to create an animation to help explain a biological process or system you won't have to start from scratch.  By downloading existing scaled animated models of cells, organisms and proteins you can quickly start animating.  If you make an improvement or create a new model then you can upload it so that other people can use your new part in the future.  Also, many excellent molecular animations are available at [http://www.molecularmovies.com molecularmovies.com], with whom we hope to collaborate.

'''Project 1: Genetic Engineering and the Registry of Standard Biological Parts '''
To start with, we are creating an animation to help explain the Registry of Standard Biological Parts to people not familiar with genetic engineering. Below is the planned story board, please feel free to edit and comment.  Everyone who contributes will be credited in the animation.

*nb E.coli don't have nuclei, so this should not be shown

*nb, these are eukaryote chromosomes, rather than bacterial chromosomes.  It would be good to have a shot saying that human chromosomes look like this, but bacterial chromosomes are circular.
