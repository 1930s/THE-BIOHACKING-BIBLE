See an excellent review: [[Phenol/chloroform extraction]]

Something I just read in the Ambion catalog, which may be informative / useful to one or more of you:<br>
<br>
"Measurement of phenols with pH paper is not accurate due to breakdown of the indicator chemicals on the paper.  To measure pH of phenol solutions with a pH meter, mix 2 mL of the organic phase with 8 mL of methanol and 10 mL of H2O.  Measure the pH of the total sample with a standard pH meter."<br>
