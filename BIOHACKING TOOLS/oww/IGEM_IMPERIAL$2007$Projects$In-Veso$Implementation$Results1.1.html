==Results Summary==

* Vesicles were formed on 15th August '07, AM. Size range: 2 - 43&mu;m.

* We can distinguish air bubbles from vesicles as air bubbles tend to only have a thin dark line around its borders. In contrast, the vesicles that we observed were much thicker, and emitted different bands of various shades when placed under phase contrast. 

* A mistake was made when we used 2ml of emulsion instead of 2ml DOPC-mineral oil suspension followed by 100Î¼l of emulsion. However, we still managed to capture images of vesicle formation as shown.
