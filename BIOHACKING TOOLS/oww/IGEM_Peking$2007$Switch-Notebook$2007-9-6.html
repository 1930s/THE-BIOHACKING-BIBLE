==Check our plate==
By smearing competent cells directly onto plates without any transformation procedure, we can check whether the plates with Kanamycin is right.

Result: The plates have some thing wrong and we discarded them!

==Colony PCR of I7100 ligation product==
Fail!

==I7100 digestion test==
using H buffer, PstI/EcoRI

Fail!

==Digestion of cIind-==

==digestion another time of vector and fragments==
using still PstI/EcoRI and H buffer

==Miniprep of I7100 for the second time==
