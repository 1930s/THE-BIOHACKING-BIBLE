==Stock solutions==

===1M magnesium chloride===
To make 100mL
*Dissolve 20.33 g MgCl<sub>2</sub>6H<sub>2</sub>O in 80mL H<sub>2</sub>O.  
*Adjust volume to 100 mL with H<sub>2</sub>O.  
*Dispense into aliquots and sterilize by autoclaving.  

MgCl<sub>2</sub> is very hygroscopic.  May want to order a fresh bottle since bottles should not be stored for a long time.

===4M potassium chloride===
To make 100mL
*Dissolve 29.82 g solid KCl in 60 mL H<sub>2</sub>O.
*Adjust volume to 100 mL with H<sub>2</sub>O.
*Autoclave for 20 minutes on liquid cycle and store at room temperature.  
*Aliquot into 100 &mu;L aliquots in sterile tubes and use one at a time.

Note that this concentration of potassium chloride solution is near the solubility limits for potassium chloride in water.  So you may need to heat slightly to help the salt go into solution.

===5M potassium acetate===
(different from Potassium Acetate)

To make 200mL
*Mix 98.14 g potassium acetate with 50 ml deionized water.  
*Adjust volume to 200 ml with deionized water. 
*Autoclave to sterilize.

===20mM zinc sulfate===
To make 100mL
*Dissolve 0.575 g zinc sulphate heptahydrate in 60mL H<sub>2</sub>O.
*Adjust volume to 100 ml with deionized water.
*Filter sterilize? ''(I did.)''

===50% glycerol===
To make 100mL
*Mix 50mL glycerol with 50mL H<sub>2</sub>O.
*Autoclave to sterilize.

===500mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.9===
To make 200mL
*Dissolve 23.83 g HEPES into 60mL H<sub>2</sub>O.
*Adjust pH to 7.9 with 5N NaOH (use 6N NaOH if available).
*Adjust volume to 200 mL with H<sub>2</sub>O.
*Filter sterilize.

===1M potassium glutamate===
*Dissolve 20.3236 g L-glutamic acid (monopotassium salt) in 60mL H<sub>2</sub>O.
*Adjust volume to 100mL H<sub>2</sub>O
*Filter sterilize? ''(I did.)''

===10% NP-40===
*Nonidet P40 (NP40). non-ionic surfactant-100mL.
*VWR catalog number 100304-536.
*Obtained from Sauer lab.  Store in dark at 2-4 &deg;C.

===20mg/mL BSA===
*Dilute 1g BSA in 50mL DI water.
*Filter sterilize

(Don't use NEB BSA anymore because it has EDTA in it which might chelate the zinc even though it is present in very small quantities.)

==Making binding reaction buffer==
Or see the [[Knight:Protein DNA binding/Option 1/quick reference recipe|quick reference recipe]].

{{:Knight:Protein DNA binding/Option 1/quick reference recipe}}

==Binding reaction conditions==

*15mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9)
**Hepes is a better buffer than Tris
*50mM potassium chloride
**it might be important that it is potassium salt rather than sodium
*50mM potassium glutamate
**why this?
*50mM potassium acetate
**why this?
*5mM magnesium chloride
**this probably matters
*20&mu;M zinc sulfate
**obviously need this
*2&mu;g/mL BSA (from NEB)
**acetylation is probably just to eliminate nuclease activity.  Heat inactivation achieves the same result according to NEB.
*5% (v/v) glycerol
*0.1% (w/v) NP-40
**detergent, likely important
*2 or 4 pM of the labeled site
**need to calculate this and determine dilution series

10&mu;L volume?  Too small?
Incubate 1hr at room temperature.
Keep DNA concentration constant and vary protein amount.
