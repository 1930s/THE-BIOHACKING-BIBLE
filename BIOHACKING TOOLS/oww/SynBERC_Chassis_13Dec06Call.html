([[SynBERC:Chassis|back to SynBERC Chassis]])<br>
12 December 2006 conference call<br>
<br>
=Agenda=
#Review of Chassis Research Thrust Goals
#Chassis Specifications : Phage resistance levels, mutation rate assays, recombination efficiency, sepsis assays
#Interface of Chasses with Devices, Practice & Testbeds

=Goal 1 Components to be changed=
# Code changes (UAG to UAA) -- STATUS: CAD complete, new allele replacement method implemented and 7 of 40 essential gene UAG codons replaced using it.  RF1 gene conditional alleles constructed.
# Introduce novel chemistries into cells -- STATUS: MCB100 class introducing novel amino acid for the UAG-minus strain

=Goal 2 Chassis robust to change & minimizing mutation rates =
# Anti-mutator alleles of: dam, dnaEQ, mutDHLMRSTY, oxyR, polAC, recAG, ssb, topB, ung, uvrD, or vsr -- STATUS: sequence CAD not initiated
# Mutationally inactivate insertion elements & transposons -- STATUS:  CAD initiated.

=Goal 3 Dedicated DNA, RNA & protein synthetic systems =
# Replication origin, conjugation, recombination  -- STATUS:  Andy Tolonen has multi-Mbp conjugation working and is setting up half-genome system in recognition of lagging-strand allelereplacement stategy (above)
# Update on [[Endy:Dedicated_systems|Dedicated RNA & protein systems]] &[[Endy:Dedicated_systems/Virtual_machines| Virtual Machines]] & [[Endy:Translation_demand|Demand specifications]]?

=Goal 4 Safety controls on the chassis =
# Specifications for lab development vs real-world use chassis (and interconversion) e.g. low and high conjugation and mutability
# Alter surface(Lps & ) -- STATUS from Adam & Chris? 
# Add complicated or rare auxotrophies to prevent survival outside the lab    

=Chassis Models=
#Translational fidelity and pausing in novel genetic codes
#Recombination and DNA synthesis forks
#[http://www.nature.com/msb/journal/v2/n1/full/msb4100090.html Minimal Cells]
#Maximal Cells -- combinatorial selections

=Chassis support for [[SynBERC:Testbeds|Testbeds]]=
#[[Tumor Destroying Bacteria]]
#[[SynBERC:Drugs | Microbial Drug Factories]]

=Chassis Characterization, Screening & Tuning=
# Test Constructs for Characterization
# Models that Support Data Analysis
# Scaleable [[SynBERC:Parts|Parts]] & [[SynBERC:Devices|Devices]] Screening & Selection Platforms
# Sequencing Platforms : [http://arep.med.harvard.edu/Polonator/ Polonies]

=Topics Arising=
#Follow up from last week on characterization of gene expression & biosynthetic devices, especially in the context of Chasiss supprot.
#OpenWetWare Needs (lower IP incumberance): conjugation, recombination, Tn-minus, others? 
# Human Practice (Thrust 4) Surveillance and best practices â€“ International Consortium for Polynucleotide Synthesis ([http://pgen.us/ICPS.htm ICPS]) was announced at the Sloan workshop 4-Dec-2006.
# Support for Mammalian Chassis?

=Action Items=
#Chassis goals for SynBERC site visit 22/23-Feb-2007.  
#Prioritized list of "year 1" chassis needs.  Can the chassis be specified in the Registry with DNA sequence information?
#Chris & Kris, The two testbeds projects need to define a lead point of contact for testbed chassis development issues.
