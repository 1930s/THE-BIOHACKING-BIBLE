== BioBrick Vectors: V0120, V0100 and V0002 ==

*We commonly use two Biobrick vectors: V0120 (same as V0100) and V0002. The V0120 vector preferred over the V0002 vector because V0120 is a high-copy plasmid (~300 ng/uL from a mini-prep of a 5 mL culture) while V0002 is not. The V0002 plasmid is most frequently found in older parts.

*The vector backbone of V0100 & V0120 are identical. The only difference is that the V0120 vector contains a part in between the Biobrick ends, while the V0100 does not.
 
*The V0120 vector contains a part composed of the coding regions for the ccdB death gene and chloramphenicol resistance. Because of this, the V0120 vector can be digested, pcr purified and used directly for ligations. Treating with CIP or gel purifying the vector is unnecessary, because transformation of any intact V0120 plasmid into normal TOP10 competent cells (purple lid) will kill the host. V0120 can be successfully propagated in TOP10 Survival competent cells (green lid).

*V0120 is part# 116 in our internal database. Its annotated sequence can be found [[Media:BBa_V0120.gb| here]].

*The annonated sequence of V0002 can be found [[Media:BBa_V0002.gb| here]].

== Sikorski Vectors: pRS304*, pRS305, pRS306 ==

*We commonly use three Sikorski vectors to integrate constructs into the genomic yeast: pRS304* (TRP1), pRS305 (LEU2), and pRS306 (URA3). The 580a strain (SBy001, PSy580) contains the trp1<math>d</math>63,leu2<math>d</math>1, and ura3-52 mutant alleles, so successful integration at these loci confers the appropriate prototrophy. You can find more information about these alleles on the [http://www.yeastgenome.org/alleletable.shtml SGD].

*The pRS305 and pRS306 vectors are as described in R. S. Sikorski and P. Hieter, Genetics, 122: 19-27 (1989). The pRS304* vector is a modified version of the pRS304 vector (same reference).

*Currently, these vectors do not contain BioBrick ends, although they are compatible with Biobrick parts. See [[Silver: BB Strategy|Strategy for Making Parts]] for more details.

*Here are the annotated sequences of the [[Media: PRS304star.gb| pRS304*]], [[Media:PRS305.gb|pRS305]], and [[Media: PRS306.gb|pRS306]]. 

== 3 plasmid assembly vectors: pSB1AC3, pSB1AK3, pSB1AT3 (still working out the bugs) ==
* Here ae the annotated sequences of the [[Media: pSB1AC3.gb | pSB1AC3]], [[Media: pSB1AK3.gb | pSB1AK3]], [[Media: pSB1AT3.gb | pSB1AT3]].

*Note: Unlike ampillicin selection, transformants must be grown in SOC for ~1 hr. before being plated unto chlorenphenicol, kanamicin, or tetracycline-containing media.
