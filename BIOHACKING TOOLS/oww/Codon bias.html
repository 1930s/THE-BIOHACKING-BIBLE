Codons can be biased depending on the neighboring codon. In E. coli, the following are some of the most marked effects for a codon depending on the nucleotide that follows:

* Lysine: AAA-G > AAG-G and AAG-C > AAA-C
* Glutamate: GAA-G > GAG-G adn GAG-C > GAA-C
* Glycine: GGC-G > (GGG-G, GGA-G, GGT-G) and GGT-A > (GGT-C, GGT-T, GGT-G)
* Phenylalanine: TTT-G > TTC-G
