'''Please post any ideas you have about OpenWetWare promotional material/advertising here.'''
*Several non-OWW people have contacted me (and others) with regard to protocols on OWW. All have said they found the site useful, but I have yet to recruit any to join OWW. I think it may be a good idea to come up with a short, standardized "recruitment" letter to send to these people. I feel that they are already part of the way there in that they found helpful info on the site, so hopefully we can come up with a way for them to join and start participating. This may also be useful for current OWWers to send to colleagues/friends they think may be interested.--[[User:Kathmc|Kathleen]] 21:49, 5 February 2006 (EST)
