==Approach==
#Part 1
#*'''Construction of High BG-promoter RFP and Hairpin constructs(completed)''' 
#*Characterization of Inducible GFP (spec out exps on plate reader / LH-FACS)
#Part 2
#*Characterization of Inducible RFP (same as inducible GFP exps)
#*'''High BG RFP-promoter  and Hairpin experiments (completed)''' (Results: [[Endy:Screening plasmid/v1.0/High BG RFP|HighBG-promoter]],[[Endy:Screening plasmid/v1.0/Hairpin|Hairpin]])
#*Based on results from (2) test inducible RFP (<bbpart>I13520</bbpart>) at low and high induction on MOFLO
#Part 3
#*Rebuild ESP if necessary based on High BG RFP/Hairpin
#*Test ESP (same as inducible GFP exps)
#**Test the flipped FP constructs, cassie's constructs, and also the other version of the ESP where we cut out ccdb and re-ligated.

==Current projects==
===High BG RFP===
*[[Endy:Screening plasmid/v1.0/High BG RFP]] - Figure out why we are seeing a high BG level of RFP in the empty SP
===Hairpin effectiveness===
*[[Endy:Screening plasmid/v1.0/Hairpin]] - characterize effectiveness of the hairpin to stabilize the mRFP1 transcript
===Characterization of Inducible GFP===

===Characterization of Inducible RFP===
<bbpart>I13520</bbpart>

===Characterization of Empty Screening Plasmid 1.0===
*[[Endy:Screening plasmid/v1.0/RNAseE sites]] - characterize effectiveness of the RNAseE sites 
*[[Endy:Screening plasmid/v1.0/Growth rates]] - characterization of growth rates under different induction levels / conditions
*[[Endy:Screening plasmid/v1.0/Steady state]] - evaluate expression levels at various time points following induction.
*[[Endy:Screening plasmid/v1.0/Characterization protocol]]
To ensure our screening system was operating as expected we measured the expression levels of GFP and mRFP1 when the plasmid did not contain a part (e.g. input equals output).

==Glycerol Boxes==
*[[Endy:Screening plasmid/v1.0/Glycerol box]]
*[[Endy:Screening plasmid/v2.0/Glycerol box]]
