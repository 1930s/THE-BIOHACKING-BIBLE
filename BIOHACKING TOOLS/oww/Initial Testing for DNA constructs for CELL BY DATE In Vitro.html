'''Aims''': 
*To determine which constructs for cell by date expresses ''in vitro''
*To test the pTet and pcI constructs in commercial S30 E.coli cell extract and home made S30 extract
*To test the pT7 construct in commercial S30 T7 cell extract and home made S30 extract.
*To investigate optimum volume of home made S30 extract
*To investigate the differences between home made and commercially bought S30 extract. This is in terms of rates of expression, length of expression and total output.
