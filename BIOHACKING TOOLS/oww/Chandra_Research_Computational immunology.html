A key step in rational vaccine development is to understand how antigens are recognized by their receptors. Several crystal structures of MHC/HLA molecules are now available. We have performed a structural bioinformatics study of peptide- HLA complexes to derive features that generate recognition specificity, useful for guiding the design process.
