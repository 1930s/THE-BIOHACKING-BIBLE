==Digestion & de-phosphorylation of plasmids using Fermentas FastDigest Enzymes==
*Note from Caroline: I think Fermentas's Fast Digest Enzymes are awesome!
# Mix:	 
#*up to 1 ug plasmid DNA (typically this is ~1/10 of the total elution volume of a mini-prep from a 5 mL overnight culture) 
#*3 µL 10x FastDigest buffer
#*distilled water to 30 µL total volume
#*1 µL enzyme 1 (1 Fast Digest unit/µL)
#*1 µL enzyme 2 (1 Fast Digest unit/µL)
#*1 µL calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP) (10 units/µL)
# Incubate at least an hour in a metal block at 37 °C.
# Purify plasmid using Qiagen's PCR product purification kit.

==Digestion of plasmids using Fermentas FastDigest Enzymes==
# Mix:	 
#*up to 1 ug plasmid DNA (typically this is ~1/10 of the total elution volume of a mini-prep from a 5 mL overnight culture) 
#*2 µL 10x FastDigest buffer
#*distilled water to 20 µL total volume
#*1 µL enzyme 1 (1 Fast Digest unit/µL)
#*1 µL enzyme 2 (1 Fast Digest unit/µL)
# Incubate at least 5 minutes in a metal block at 37 °C.
# Purify digested insert & plasmid using PCR product purification kit.

==Digestion of PCR product using NEB Enzymes==
# Mix:	 
#*All of PCR product DNA (~28 µL if PCR purification was eluted in 30 µL) 
#*3.5 µL 10x BSA
#*3.5 µL 10x buffer (see [http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/tech_reference/restriction_enzymes/double_digests.asp? NEB website] for optimal double digest buffer choices)  
#*0.2 µL enzyme 1 (20 units/µL)
#*0.2 µL enzyme 2 (20 units/µL)
#*distilled water to 35 µL total volume
#*Note: keep the glycerol concentration below 5%, the volume of both restriction enzymes added should not exceed 5% of the total reaction volume.
# Incubate at least an hour (better overnight) at 37 °C.
# Purify digested insert using PCR product purification kit.

==Digestion of Biofusion vector: Old Procedure==
# Mix: 
#*700 ng Biofusion vector (BBa_V0002 or BBa_V0100) 
#*1 µL 10 x BSA
#*1 µL 10x buffer (see [http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/tech_reference/restriction_enzymes/double_digests.asp? NEB website] for optimal double digest buffer choices) 
#*0.2 µL enzyme 1 (20 units/µL)
#*0.2 µL enzyme 2 (20 units/µL)
#*distilled water to 10 µL total volume
#*Note: To keep the glycerol concentration below 5%, the volume of both restriction enzymes added should not exceed 10% of the total reaction volume.
# Incubate overnight at 37 °C.
# The next morning, add 0.1 µL CIP (10 units/µL) and incubate for 1 hr. at 37 °C.
