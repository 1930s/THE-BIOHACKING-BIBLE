This page will help coordinate the experimental/computational work being undertaken to improve the evolutionary stability of engineered biological systems.  Read [[Evolutionary Stability|here]] for more background.

==Project Outline==
#Evaluate and select several [[Endy:Counter-selectable markers for studying evolutionary stability|counter-selectable markers]].
#Evaluate a method for reliable long-term cell growth in ''E.Coli.''  These include:
#*Chemostat
#*Batch dilutions
#Measure mutation rate of counter-selectable marker in long-term culture.
#Develop an [[Endy:Algorithm for codon optimization for evolutionary stability|codon optimization algorithm]] for specifying a new DNA seq for the counter-selectable marker
#*[[Endy:Evolutionary stability project/Mutation background|Background research]] on the mechanisms by which cell spontaneiously mutate, the start of this can be found [[Endy:Algorithm for codon optimization for evolutionary stability|here]].
#Synthesize  counter-selectable marker with "stabilized" sequence
#Measure the mutation rate of the new marker.
