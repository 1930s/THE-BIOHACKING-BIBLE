=Model Development for Infector Detector=

==Formulation of the problem==
As described earlier, Infector Detector (ID) is a simple biological detector, which serves to expose bacterial biofilm. It functions by exploiting the inherent AHL production employed by the quorum-sensing bacteria, in the formation of such structures.<br>

<font color = red>~~Insert diagram illustrating this phenomenon </font><br>

Our project attempts to improve where previous methods of biofilm detection have proven ineffective: first and foremost, by focussing on the sensitivity of the system, to low levels of AHL production (bacterial chatter).
In doing so, a complete investigation of the level of sensitivity to [AHL] needs to be performed - in other words, what is the minimal [AHL] for appreciable expression of reporter protein. Furthermore, establish a functional range for AHL detection. How does increased [AHL] impact on maximal output of reporter protein?<br>
Also, how can the system performance be tailored, by exploiting the remaining state variables (e.g. varying initial [LuxR] and/or [pLux]).  

The system performance here revolves most importantly around AHL sensitivity; however, the effect on, maximal output of fluorescent reporter protein and/or response time is, likewise, of great importance.

Our approach, involves the proposal of two simple constructs, varying with respect to the manner in which LuxR is introduced into the system:
*Construct 1 - represented by [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_T9002| T9002], incorporates constitutive expression of LuxR by pTET.
*Construct 2 - simpler in nature, lacks pTET; LuxR is introduced in purified form here.<br>

<font color = red>~~Here explain briefly why Construct 2 was selected, i.e. we were concerned with the time the system would take to reach steady-state (that is before energy-dependence was considered) - due to almost negligible <math> \delta_{LuxR}</math>, etc </font>.

==Selection of model structure==
At reasonably high molecular concentrations of the state variables, a continuous model can be adopted, which is represented by a system of ordinary differential equations. 

It is for this reason that our approach to modelling the system follows a deterministic, continuous approximation. In developing this model, we were interested in the behaviour at steady-state, that is when the system has equilibrated and the concentrations of the state variables remain constant.

In adopting this approach, we perform the following assumptions:

====Assumptions====
*Ignore spatial information of the system; we ignore molecular dynamics of the system - this is a kinetic model.
*Keep track of total number of molecules of each type - by tracking the concentrations of these state variables (as a continuous variable)
*System is homogeneous - well-stirred, so that the molecules of each type are spread uniformly throughout the spatial domain.  In doing so, we assume thermal equilibrium 
*Volume of the spatial domain remains constant


The system kinetics are determined by the following six coupled-ODEs.

==Establishing a representative model==

* '''Introduction'''
We can condition the system in various manners, but for the purposes of our project, Infector Detector, we will seek a formulation which is valid for both constructs considered. <br><br>

Our initial approach assumed that energy would be in unlimited supply, and that our system would eventually reach steady-state (Model 1). Experimentation suggested otherwise; our system needed to be amended. This lead to the development of model 2, an energy-dependent network, where the dependence on energy assumed Hill-like dynamics:
<br><br>

===Model 1: Steady-state is attained; limitless energy supply <font color = red>''(link here to derivation)''</font>===

<br>
<math>\frac{d[LuxR]}{dt} = k_1 + k_3[A] - k2[LuxR][AHL]- \delta_{LuxR}[LuxR]</math>

<br>
<math>\frac{d[AHL]}{dt} = k_3[A] - k2[LuxR][AHL]- \delta_{AHL}[AHL]</math>

<math>\frac{d[A]}{dt} = -k_3[A] + k2[LuxR][AHL]- k_4[A][P] + k_5[AP]</math>

<math>\frac{d[P]}{dt} = -k_4[A][P] + k_5[AP]</math>

<math>\frac{d[AP]}{dt} = k_4[A][P] - k_5[AP]</math>

<math>\frac{d[GFP]}{dt} = k_6[AP] - \delta_{GFP}[GFP]</math>

===Model 2: Equations developed through steady-state analysis; however due to limited energy supply, we operate in the transient regime===

<br>
<math>\frac{d[LuxR]}{dt} = k_1\bigg(\frac{[E]^n}{K_E^n + [E]^n}\bigg) + k_3[A] - k_2[LuxR][AHL]- \delta_{LuxR}[LuxR]</math>
<br>
<math>\frac{d[AHL]}{dt} = k_3[A] - k_2[LuxR][AHL]- \delta_{AHL}[AHL]</math>

<math>\frac{d[A]}{dt} = -k_3[A] + k_2[LuxR][AHL]- k_4[A][P] + k_5[AP]</math>

<math>\frac{d[P]}{dt} = -k_4[A][P] + k_5[AP]</math>

<math>\frac{d[AP]}{dt} = k_4[A][P] - k_5[AP]</math>

<math>\frac{d[GFP]}{dt} = k_6[AP]\bigg(\frac{[E]^n}{K_E^n + [E]^n}\bigg) - \delta_{GFP}[GFP]</math>

<math>\frac{d[E]}{dt} = -\alpha_{1}k_1\bigg(\frac{[E]^n}{K_E^n + [E]^n}\bigg) - \alpha_{2}k_6[AP]\bigg(\frac{[E]^n}{K_E^n + [E]^n}\bigg)</math>

The system of equations for the two constructs varies strictly with respect to the value of the parameter k1. Construct 1 possesses a non-zero k1 rate constant, whereas for construct 2, a zero value is assumed.
