== Matthew who? ==

I am an undergraduate at UC Davis pursing a degree in Genetics with minors in Computer Science and History.  I joined Dr. Maloof's lab to help work on developing a computer model for the circadian clock.  Originally, I'm from Walnut Creek in the Bay Area.


== Interests ==
When I'm not working at the lab or doing schoolwork, I enjoy cycling and playing frisbee.  If by some loophole in the space-time continuum I still have some extra time, I also like to play video games.  My favorites include Fallout 2, Diablo II, and Warcraft.
