==Summary==
Cleaner stocks of T7 that concentrates and purifies T7 bacteriophage.

==Protocol==
#Grow 100mL of permissive cells to a density of 10<sup>8</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup> cells/ml at 30&deg;C in a rotary shaking water bath.  Inoculate the cells with a drop from a master phage stock.  Continue to shake cells in the water bath at 30&deg;C until culture clarifies.  ''Be careful not to let culture sit for long (>15 minutes) after culture clarifies''.
#Add NaCl to the lysate to make the final concentration 1 molar.  Centrifuge the lysate at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, Discard the cellular debris, and add 10 grams polyethylene glycol (PEG) m.w. 8000 (10% w/v) to the supernatant.  Gently stir the mixture until the PEG has totally dissolved.  Keep lysate on ice for 1 hour.
#* Need to check the 1 hour incubation step because of warning from Studier on leaving cultures too long in the cell debris.  See [[Studier Lysate Prep]]
#Pellet the phage at 5,000 rpm for 15 min.  Decant the supernatant, and very gently resuspend the pellet in 3.5 mL of [[T7 Buffer]].  Centrifuge the lysate at 5,000 rpm for 10 min, and keep the supernatant.
#Pour a cesium chloride step gradient: add 0.5 mL of cesium chloride with a density of 1.6 to the bottom of a centrifuge tube that fits in a SW 40.1 rotor.  Gently layer 0.5 mL of cesium chloride &rho;=1.5 onto the &rho;=1.6 layer.  Finally add 0.5 mL of cesium chloride &rho;=1.4 onto the &rho;=1.5 layer.
#Gently layer the phage supernatant onto the cesium chloride step gradient.  Centrifuge the phage in a SW 50.1 rotor at 30,000 rpm for 2 to 3 hours.  The phage will band at the &rho;=1.5 layer.
#Remove the phage band from the side of the tube with a syringe.
#Remove the cesium chloride by dialysis against 0.5 to 1 Liter of [[T7 Buffer]] at 4&deg;C.
