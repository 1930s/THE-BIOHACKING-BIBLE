I have received a Ph.D. degree in Biophysics and Computational Biology from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in December 2006. During my graduate study, I worked with [[http://bio.physics.uiuc.edu Prof. Taekjip Ha]]on '''single molecule fluorescence microscopy'''. I was primarily responsible for developing novel experimental assays for single molecule toolkit using vesicles. I am now a post-doctoral associate with Johan Paulsson, and working on counting proteins in live cells.
