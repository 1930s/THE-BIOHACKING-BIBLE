==Tony==
*restrict and run gel pSB4A3 (need more volume than yesterday)
*gel extract, ligate, and transform IIR+motB constructs into pSB4A3 
*competency prep on RP437
*transform RP437 and RP3087 with GFP 
*transform R0100+motB, C0051 (from registry plate) and pSB4A3 into DH5a

==Jon==
*use Pat's program to create a map of the IIR+motB part in pSB1A2 and pSB4A3
*restrict R0051 and motB, and run on gel
*make LB AND SOB
