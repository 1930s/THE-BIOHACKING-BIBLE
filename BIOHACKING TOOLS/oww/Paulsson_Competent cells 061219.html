===Electrocompetent cell prep 12/19/06===

*Primary cultures grown overnight at 37deg in LB from single colonies of XL1-Blue and TOP10
XL1-B: 1/10 dilution, OD600 = 0.042, measured on Nanodrop in triplicate<br>
TOP10: 1/10 dilution, OD600 = 0.035<br>

*Secondary cultures:<br>
XL1-B: inoculated approx. 600ml LB with 2.5ml... 3.25hrs later OD600 = 0.055<br>
TOP10: inoculated approx. 600ml LB with 2.6ml... 3.25hrs later OD600 = 0.079<br>

*Followed CP method, using solutions and tubes pre-cooled in ice water baths, pipets and pipet tips pre-cooled at -20deg.

Split culture into two 500ml centrifuge tubes.<br>
Washed each with 350ml water.<br>
Resuspended cells in residual supernatant (~30ml).  Pooled cells and brought volume to ~400ml with water.<Br>
Very loose pellet after water washes.  Resuspended in ~30-40ml residual supernatant, then added 10% glycerol to ~100ml. Transfered to two 50ml conical tubes.  Pelleted cells.<br>
''for XL1-Blue'': ~250ul packed cells per tube.  Resuspended to ~1ml of cell suspension. <br>
''for TOP10'': ~400ul packed cells and more sup.  Resuspended to ~1.6ml total pooled.<br>
Dispensed 50ul or 100ul aliquots using cut tips (wide-mouth) to pre-cooled tubes on bed of dry ice.  Stored at -80deg.

*Transformation test
Thawed cells.  Added 1ul 1ng/ul pST11 pDNA.  Flicked tube and transfered to 0.2cm e-poration cuvette.  Zapped using MicroPulser on setting "Ec2".  Immediately added 950ul SOC, mixed cells, transfered to culture tube.  Shook at 30deg for 75min.<br>

Made serial 10-fold dilutions (to 1/1000) and plated 100ul cells (1/100 and 1/1000 in duplicate) onto LB/Amp.  Grew o/n at 30deg.  (100 cells on 1/1000 dilution = 10(6) cells per ng of pDNA)
