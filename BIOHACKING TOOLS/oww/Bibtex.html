==Embedding bibtex==
The installed Exhibit extension understands bibtex format so can allow you to create easily searchable bibliographies using sites like [http://citeulike.org citeulike]. For example, look at [[Synthetic Biology:Articles]] which is dynamically updated from the citeulike based on articles tagged with syntheticbiology.

To use, all you need to do is:
<pre>
{{exhibit bibtex}}
<bibtex file="http://citeulike.org/bibtex/tag/whatever"></bibtex>
</pre>

The formatting of each article line is entirely customizable. See the [[Template:Exhibit_bibtex|template]] and read the documentation for [http://simile.mit.edu/wiki/Exhibit Exhibit]

==LaTeXdoc==
These bibtex style files are meant to be used with LaTeXdoc for collaborating on entire LaTeX documents on the wiki.
* [[/plainurl.bst/]]: add url support to standard 'plain' bibtex style
