===Overview===
The ''' ''Synthetic Society Working Group'' ''' (SSWG) is a group of individuals who are working to directly address societal issues embedded and surrounding the emerging field of synthetic biology.  Everybody is welcome to participate either via contributions to the pages hosted on this wiki, by visiting Boston for a meeting, or by arranging a local workshop elsewhere.  At MIT, participants include scientists and engineers engaged in synthetic biology research, scholars expert in considering societal issues associated with emerging technologies, community leaders, and interested individuals.  One goal of the SSWG is to make unbiased progress on the issues.  Another goal is to collect and organize resources in order to facilitate widespread understanding and consideration of the issues.

===Background===
<font color="green">'''What is synthetic biology?'''</font> <br>
The limited, working definition of ''synthetic biology'' that we are using in our discussions is (i) the design and construction of new biological parts, devices, and systems and (ii) the re-design of existing, natural biological systems for useful purposes.  That is, we are now primarily interested in considering the impact of new, engineered biological systems that are encoded via standard four-base DNA (that is, A, T, C, G).  This "definition" leaves out certain aspects of synthetic biology research (for example, understanding the origins of life by re-creating a cell from raw chemicals in the lab).  Two reasons encourage us to use of a focused definition.  First, we believe that the direct engineering of living systems via standard DNA will have the widest societal impact over the near term.  Second, we are likely already at risk of trying to do too much.  

<font color="green">'''What issues are you considering?'''</font>  <br>
<font color="red">We are considering four classes of issues: (i) Biological Risks and Security, (ii) Understanding and Perception, (iii) Ownership, Sharing, and Innovation, and (iv) Community Organization and Culture.</font>  Each of these issues is introduced in detail below.  If there's an additional class that you think should be considered please let us know.

<font color="green">'''What approach are you taking?'''</font>  <br>
*Identifying the questions & issues
*Identifying and describing points of uncertainty
*Empirics and relation to past experience (anchoring speculation via history)

<font color="green">'''Are we taking benefits and applications for granted?  Should this be an additional topic?'''</font>  <br>

<font color="green">'''What's reality? What can be done today?'''</font>  <br>
*[[Synthetic_Society/SB_Reality | Examples of what can be done today]] <br>

<font color="green">'''ETC Group's [http://www.etcgroup.org/en/materials/publications.html?id=602 introduction] to synthetic biology'''</font>  <br>

[editorial note: the sections below should likely move to their own independent pages as soon as we start making real progress]

===Biological Risks and Security===

<font color="green">'''Place holder questions'''</font>
*Programming in DNA will require a library of basic biological functions that can be used over and over again in combination.
**Who is going to make such libraries?  [Can it be made?]
**Who is going to own such libraries? [Will anybody?]
*DNA synthesis lets you convert genetic information into genetic material.
**How cheap will gene/genome synthesis become?
**Will anybody pay attention to material transfer agreements for DNA?
**Can copyright be still further munged so that it applies to DNA?
*Will/do existing and future patents restrict progress in synthetic biology?
**What alternative strategies might better promote collaboration but still reward investors to fund the expensive research and development required to bring biotechnologies to market (ie clinical testing of novel biological therapeutics)?
*How do ownership terms impact perception and public acceptance of biological technologies?
*Something that is hard today (for example, designing a protein) will become easier tomorrow.  How to best incentivize such work?  
*Something that is hard to do once (for example, designing the first copy of a synthetic protein) is easy to reproduce...  
*More TBD.
