===How It Works===
Practice talks are ad hoc meetings scheduled to provide researchers with an opportunity to practice giving a presentation for a conference or an examination in front of an audience. These practice environments are very important to our fellow researchers and therefore it is requested that all group members attend these meetings unless there is a prior conflict. Audience members should come prepared to provide feedback, constructive criticism, and questions to the presenter.
