==Minipreps and Digests==

*Digested: J37015RS, J37016
*Miniprep-ed: AiiA, Cre 1,2,4, 12D->2H


==Maxipreps==

*Maxiprep-ed Cre 1,2,4, AiiA, 12D->2H (need to check against minipreps and decide what to ligate)


==Sequencing== 

The sequencing of J37015 was successful - the sequence we have and the expected sequence have been compared and it can be seen that there are only a couple of base substitutions
