The objective of our research is to understand the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology development] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution evolution] of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocortex neocortex]. The neocortex, the part of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain brain] that integrates [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensations sensations], executes [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making decisions] and is responsible for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition cognition] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception perception], is a region of the nervous system that is unique to mammals. It is also a highly evolved part of the brain, exhibiting striking differences in relative size and complexity between different mammalian species, including primates. Morphologically, the neocortex is a large, sheet-like structure, composed of six cellular layers. However, the neocortex is a modular structure, with different areas of the six-layered sheet connected to different parts of the nervous system and thereby devoted to different functions. Thus, there are modules primarily dedicated to, for example, motor control, the somatic senses, vision and hearing.

Our two primary research questions are:

- how are [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurons neurons] destined for each of the six layers generated in a temporal order by neocortical [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell stem] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell progenitor] cells?

- how are neocortical areas formed, or how are area-specific neurons produced by neocortical stem and progenitor cells?
