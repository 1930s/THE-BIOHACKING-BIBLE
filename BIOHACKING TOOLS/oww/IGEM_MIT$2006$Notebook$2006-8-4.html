'''Conclusions'''

#pUC19 again did not work.  We need a new control plasmid.
#Since Meagan said that the AC and AT backbones did not work in her assembly and they did not work in our assembly, we should try to get new backbones for the antibiotic construction method.  Until then, we should do assemblies using just the gel extraction method.
#We need to check to see if the three plates contain the correct colonies.  We will colony PCR today, and if we see the correct bands, we should LC, miniprep, and sequence those colonies while moving ahead with attaching R0040 to the two structures.
