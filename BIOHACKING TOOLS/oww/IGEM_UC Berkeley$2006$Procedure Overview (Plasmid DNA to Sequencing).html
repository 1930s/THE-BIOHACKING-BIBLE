1. Plasmid DNA<br>
Path 1<br>
- Restriction Digest of Plasmid DNA<br>
- Run a Gel to separate parts<br>
- Gel purify the desired part (not always going to be the shorter or longer band- could be either)<br>
'''- Result: Double stranded linear DNA with sticky ends'''<br>
Path 2<br>
- PCR desired Plasmid<br>
- Run an analytical gel to determine whether PCR worked correctly<br>
- Result is liner double stranded DNA in buffer<br>
- PCR cleanup<br>
- Result is linear double stranded DNA in H2O<br>
- Restriction Digest<br>
- Cleanup- take only the strands that we want to insert into plasmid<br>
'''- Result: Double stranded linear DNA with sticky ends'''


2. Ligation<br>
- DNA ligase connects double stranded fragements of DNA with reverse complement sticky ends<br>
'''- Result: Relaxed double stranded circular DNA'''


3. Transformation- insert new plasmid into cell<br>
- Plate<br>
- Observe results- are they expected or unusual?

4. Grow up colonies of cells in LB


5. Screen<br>
Path 1<br>
- Mini prep<br>
- Restriction Map<br>
'''- Result: Indentified clones'''<br>
Path 2<br>
- Colony PCR<br>
'''- Result: Indentified clones'''

6. Sequence- is plasmid what it should be?<br>
