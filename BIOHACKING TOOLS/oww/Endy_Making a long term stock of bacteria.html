''Back to [[Making a long term stock of bacteria]]
==Materials==
*40% glycerol solution
*Cryogenic vials

==Method==
*Add 1 ml of 40% glycerol in H<sub>2</sub>O to a cryogenic vial.
*Add 1 ml sample from the culture of bacteria to be stored.
*Gently vortex the cryogenic vial to ensure the culture and glycerol is well-mixed.
**Alternatively, pipet to mix.
*Use a tough spot to put the name of the strain or some useful identifier on the top of the vial.
*On the side of the vial list all relevant information - part, vector, strain, date, researcher, etc.
*Store in a freezer box in a -80C freezer.  Remember to record where the vial is stored for fast retrieval later.

==Notes==
*While it is possible to make a long term stock from cells in stationary phase, ideally your culture should be in logarithmic growth phase.
