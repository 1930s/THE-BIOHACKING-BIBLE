==Before Starting Benchwork==

Chances are you have previously fulfilled some of the following requirements if you have previously worked at MIT.  However, safety requirements vary greatly from department to department.  Discrepencies exist even within the Biology department depending on the building you work in.  Regardless of where you have worked previously you must still complete the following before you can begin any bench work.   

===Minimal Requirements===

#[[Lab Specific Chemical Hygiene]] Training
#Read Biology Department [[Safety Plan]] and complete internal questionnaire
#Read [[Chemical Hygiene Plan]]


After completing these requirements (in addition to any required in the next section), see the lab Safety Officer (Heather) in order to sign a [[Compliance Form]].

===Requirements You May Have Fullfilled Previously===

The following must also be completed before you can begin benchwork.  However, if you have previously completed this training with a different department it does not need to be repeated.  If you feel that you have fulfilled one of these requirements with a different, yet equivalent course please see the lab Safety Officer (Heather).

#Complete [[Training Needs Assessment]] (requires MIT certificate)
#*If you have already used this training system before, you need only update your [[Training Needs Assessment]] to list Drew Endy as your Primary DLC.
#[[General Chemical Hygiene]] Training (online)
#*You do not need to repeat this course if previously completed it while working else where at the Institute.
#[[Managing Hazardous Waste]] Training (online)
#*You will need to repeat this course if you have not taken it in the last year.

==Additional Requirements==

*All individuals planning to do lab work also need to complete the [[General Biosafety for Researchers]] course in a timely fashion.  However, this does not need to be completed prior to beginning lab work.  If you completed this previously you do not need to repeat it.

*(optional) Anyone who will be using radioactivity in their experiments must first complete the [[Radiation Training]] course.  This training is not required unless you are using radioactivity.  If you completed this training previously you need only repeat it if your certification is outdated (more than 2 years old).

==Renewing Your Training==

The following must be completed annually:
#[[Managing Hazardous Waste]]
#[[Lab Specific Chemical Hygiene]] Training
