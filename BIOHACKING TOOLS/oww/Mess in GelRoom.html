[[Image:Messy balance.JPG|thumb|left|Is this how you want your shared resources to look?]]Kathleen discovered that someone had been misusing the shared balance with the Sauer Lab.  
As general (inter- and inra-) lab courtesy, please keep all shared areas clean.  This means not leaving the balance and brush left with a bunch of blue crap all over it.  Kathleen was nice enough to clean the balance up, however the brush is still quite messy.  If this way you, please fess up.  If you don't want to fess up, please clean it up yourself.

*Not sure who did this or which lab they are in (Endy/Sauer), don't really care. I will be updating the Sauer lab on this issue, too. â€“[[User:Kathmc|Kathleen]]
