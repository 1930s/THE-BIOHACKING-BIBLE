*Follow the Quant-it protocol for DNA (and RNA) quantification.
*Make up standard measurements along with your samples.
*If unsure of your scale (if you have a lot or a little) then do 3 concentrations of your sample to check, one at  100% concentration, one at 1:10 other at 1:100
*First you are making a 1:10 (add 1ul DNA to 9ul TE to make 1:10), then you are taking 1 uL of this 1:10 solution and adding it to 99 uL. So that is 1:100 of the 1:10 so the solution where you took 1 uL of this 1:10 solution and added to 99ul TE is 1:1000 of the original DNA concentration (1:10 * 1:100). 
*Do 2 of TE or whatever you are resuspending in to subtract this background from your results.
*set up the plate reader and computer.
*Add the fluorescent reagent (make up enough: 100 assays = 20 ml HS buffer) - 200ul added to each plate, make sure you have enough and careful when pipetting, keep track of which hole you want to add it to.
*read the plate
