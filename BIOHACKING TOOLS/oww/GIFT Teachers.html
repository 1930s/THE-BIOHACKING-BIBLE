==Purpose==

Members of the GIFT program for public school teachers placed in the Bio-[[MIBLab]]s become acquainted with the research and fields of study being developed here to better understand the current trends, standards, and careers in science today, and to translate that experience into a strategy, lesson plan, teaching style, and/or activity in my classroom in their school system in order to encourage interest and achievement in math and sciences in early education with the goal of increased enrollment in these fields and career paths.
