This is a shared space for SynBERC students, research assistants and post-docs.  (Any student, research assistant or post-doc who is affiliated with a SynBERC investigator and does SynBERC-related research is a part of the training group.)

==Events==

===Seminar series===
A multi-institutional seminar series organized by the students.  A mixture of faculty and student speakers (and people from industry?)  ~2 talks per institution.

See [[SynBERC:Seminar series]].

===Past events===

====NSF Site visit & SynBERC Retreat, February 21-24, 2007====

See [[SynBERC:Training group/2007 site visit]].

==What should we do?==
What exactly should the SynBERC training group work on?  Here is a running list of ideas.  Please contribute.

===Online discussions regarding the research===
Here's a [[Talk:Synthetic Biology:BioBricks/Standardization|model for discussions]] that might be valuable to have centering around the work.

===Course materials===
Developing new courses around synthetic biology.

===Synthetic biology demos===
Something based on the bacterial photography system from UCSF and UT Austin or on the mint and banana smelling bacteria from the MIT iGEM team.  It would give people a tangible introduction to synthetic biology.

===Online games===
Online synthetic biology games?
