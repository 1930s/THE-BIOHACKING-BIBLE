== Motivation ==

It can be very perplexing for the environmentally conscious consumer to contrast different “items” in terms of their cost to the environment (also referred to as externalities). What will have less of an environmental impact, Is it better to drive or fly and can it be at all compared to other activities using a common environmental currency?

 
== Test cases ==

As a proof of concept we are trying to focus on several questions listed below which are of interest to many people. 

* [http://openwetware.org/wiki/Ecost_Plastic_Paper '''Plastic or paper?'''] A discussion in terms of natural costs for disposable bags, cups and dishes, etc. Is it better to use a paper bag, plastic bag or some reusable bag that is more difficult to produce but lasts longer? What is the cost of using disposable dishes in comparison to reusable ones?  What if the plates are made out of compostable corn product, paper, or plastic?  
* [http://openwetware.org/wiki/Ecost_Drive_Fly '''Drive or fly?''']  
* '''Bus, train or carpool?'''
* '''Dishwasher or hand wash?''' A discussion in terms of natural costs of weather it is better to wash those dishes by hand or in a dishwasher? 
* '''Hybrid or conventional?''' buying a hybrid or just a smaller car? What is the natural cost of producing and replacing the battery of a hybrid car?
* '''Local/organic or conventional food?'''

We begin by serving as an annotated portal to the literature with the hope that we will be able to follow up with independent integrative assessment when we have assembled a suitable collection of people.

== Aims == 

The task of The Natural Cost is to estimate, for each such item, the cost in terms of resources: energy, pollution, water, bulk resource etc. and in terms of the aggregate cost of offsetting the individual costs (eco$).  This estimate will be based on expert analysis of each item.

We hope to help make more educated decisions, enable appreciation of the costs of consumption, educate about the complexities and challenges of environmental costs evaluation.

Clearly this is an immense task and the estimates are bound to be dependent on the assumptions taken, the expert evaluating them, etc. Yet the need is great and the heightened level of awareness, coupled with the technological advances in communicating information, makes it very timely. The hope is that such a resource will be instrumental in the following ways:

*	Individuals will be able to make more informed decisions about their consumption

*	Assuming this will affect the choices of consumers, firms will have an incentive to try to minimize the Natural Cost of their products and thus advance their sales. This can create a positive feedback loop based on competition. 


In order to achieve such a tool there will need to be a large evaluation process of the complete life cycle costs as well as advances in the “algorithms” or economic framework of integrating these externalities. We are encouraged by examples such as the Forest Stewardship Council, and other organizations. It is well understood that for such an effort to succeed there will be a need for significant funds and many dedicated people to invest years of work.

Clearly at this stage the formulation is very naïve and rudimentary, any comments and suggestions will be highly appreciated.
