==Overview==
A method for buffer exchange of protein samples in small volume (100-200 &mu;L) containing 10ng-5mg of protein using a microcentrifuge.

==Materials==
*Sephadex G-25 superfine
*[[Knight:Protein DNA binding|Knight:Protein DNA binding buffer]]
*[[Knight:Protein DNA binding|Knight:Protein DNA binding buffer]] supplemented with BSA to a concentration of 1mg/mL
*Polyethylene disk
*Column for Sephadex
*Collection tube

==Procedure==
===Preparing the gel===
#Mix an appropriate weight of dry Sephadex powder with excess [[Knight:Protein DNA binding|protein DNA binding buffer]].
#*''Protocol calls for using 25mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.  But I think that my protein DNA binding buffer should work.''<cite>Helmerhorst-AnalBiochem-1980</cite>
#*''Bed volume is 4-6mL per gram of Sephadex G25 superfine.''
#*''Try 1g sephadex per 40 mL [[Knight:Protein DNA binding|protein DNA binding buffer]].
#Allow Sephadex to hydrate by doing one of the following
##Incubate overnight at 20&deg;C (minimum time is 3 hours).  
##*''Swelling time depends on type of Sephadex.  Minimum incubation time assumes Sephadex G-25 superfine.''
##Autoclave 20 mins.
##*''This has the advantage of sterilizing the Sephadex slurry thereby avoiding fungus growth during long term storage.''

===Packing a column===

#Adjust the suspension of the gel so that it is a fairly thick slurry.  It should not be so thick as to retain air bubbles.  75% of settled gel is suitable (i.e. 3/4 gel and 1/4 buffer).  Fine particles can be removed by decantation if desired.
#Degas suspension under vacuum.
#*''Not necessary if the Sephadex was swollen using a boiling water bath.  The gel suspension should be allowed to cool to temperature of column operation however.''
#*''How necessary is this?  Not included in all protocols.''
#Break off tab at the bottom of empty column.
#Place empty column in 2mL collection tube.
#Tilt the column and pipette the well-mixed gel suspension down the inside wall of the column.
#*''The suspension seemed to settle a lot.  So I removed excess buffer and added more suspension.''  
#Readjust the column to the vertical position.  
#Place a polyethylene disk on the surface of the gel and compress gel further to avoid air gap formation between gel and disk.
#*''Ensures even loading of sample.''
#*''I omitted this step and it seemed okay.''
#It is unclear what bed volume to aim for.

===Column equilibration===
#Pipette out excess buffer from column.
#Centrifuge at 1400 ''g'' for 2 mins.
#Wash with 400&mu;L [[Knight:Protein DNA binding|protein DNA binding buffer]].
#*''Protocol calls for using 100mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.  But I think that my protein DNA binding buffer should work.''<cite>Helmerhorst-AnalBiochem-1980</cite>
#Centrifuge at 1400 ''g'' for 15 secs.
#Discard flow through.
#Wash with 400&mu;L [[Knight:Protein DNA binding|protein DNA binding buffer]].
#*''Protocol calls for using 100mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.  But I think that my protein DNA binding buffer should work.''<cite>Helmerhorst-AnalBiochem-1980</cite>
#Centrifuge at 1400 ''g'' for 15 secs.
#Discard flow through.
#Wash with 400&mu;L [[Knight:Protein DNA binding|protein DNA binding buffer]] supplemented with BSA to a concentration of 1mg/mL.  
#Centrifuge at 1400 ''g'' for 2 mins.
#Discard flow through.

===Running the column===
#Move column to new tube.
#Apply sample to column.
#Centrifuge at 1400 ''g'' for 2 mins.
#*''Reduce spin time to 30 secs to eliminate protein dilution by 20%.
#*''Recovered very small volume with 30 secs spin.''
#Sample should be in tube.

==Notes==
*Stopped columns equilibrated in 100mM potassium phosphate, pH8 containing 0.2% sodium azide can be stored at room temperature for several months.<cite>Helmerhorst-AnalBiochem-1980</cite>  
**''Haven't tried this myself.''
*Columns can be reused up to 6 times by repeating column equilibration steps described above (except removal of excess buffer).  <cite>Helmerhorst-AnalBiochem-1980</cite>
