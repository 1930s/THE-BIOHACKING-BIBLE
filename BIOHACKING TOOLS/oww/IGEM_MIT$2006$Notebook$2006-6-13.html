#Made glycerols of BAMT and SAMT from BL21 (6/9/06)
#*Made two copies (4 total) of each by adding 1ml of each to glycerol stock (let sit for 30 min)
#Created minipreps of the BAMT and SAMT from BL21 (6/9/06)
#*Used the protocol outlined: http://openwetware.org/wiki/Miniprep/Qiagen_kit
#*Spun total of 3.6 mls of each- [as not many cells in culture, added more (to 3.6) and spun again]
#*Added 250µl of P1 and vortexed, added 250µl of P2 and inverted a couple of times, added 350µl of N3 and centrifuged for 10 min
#*Washed with PB (optional in protocol, but done here)
#*Added only 35µl instaed of 50µl of EB (DNA may be on low side) 
#Created additional liquid cultures of colonies from Top10(TK) 200µl plates
#*3 from each of SAMT, BAMT, and BSMT from 6/12/06.
#*Added 10mL of LB for liquid cultures


*'''[[User:Rshetty|RS]] 14:15, 13 June 2006 (EDT)''': Just after you left we realized that no one had started BL21DE3 cultures (without plasmid) as a negative control for tomorrow.  So I went ahead and took some competent cells and streaked a plate and started a 100mL culture for you.  This will serve as a good point of comparison when "testing" the cultures tomorrow.

==pET-28 Primers==
#T7 (TTA ATA CGA CTC ACT ATA GGG) (T7 promoter)
#TphiBBAP (CCT TCT GCA GCG GCC GCT ACT AGT ACA AAA AAC CCC TCA AGA CCC GTT TAG AGG CC CAA GGG) [T7 terminator]

==Notes==

===Sequencing===
*[http://www.emdbiosciences.com/docs/NDIS/69864-000.html pET28a(+) genbank file] from Novagen <- Is this is the vector that the constructs came in?
*This vector has a T7 promoter primer binding site but no T3, SP6, M13 Forward or M13 Reverse primer binding site.
*Does anyone have a T7 terminator primer?
