==Transposome DNA construction from plasmid cutting==
* Cut the transposome out of the containing plasmid with PvuII enzyme, which cuts at the correct location at the mosaic end.
* Cut also with an enzyme which produces shorter fragments from the remaining plasmid backbone to make gel purification easier.  Sau3AI is a good enzyme.
** Use NEB Buffer 1 with BSA which is good for both Sau3AI and PvuII.
* TT01 transposon is 2478 bp long
* Reaction
** 20 &mu;g of plasmid DNA from a maxiprep
** 10 &mu;l NEB Buffer 1
**  1 &mu;l 100x BSA
** 3 &mu;l PvuII
** 1 &mu;l Sau3AI
** QS water to 100 &mu;l
** Heat 37&deg; 1 hour
** Heat kill the enzymes 20 minutes at 65&deg;
** Add 20 &mu;l loading dye
** Load and run on a prep gel
** Cut the band at 2478 bp from the gel
** Weigh the cut band
** Add 3x volume Qiagen QX1 buffer
** Add 30 &mu;l Qiaex II suspension
** Heat at 50&deg; while vortexing until completely dissolved
** Spin, discard, resuspend in 1 ml QX1 buffer
** Spin, discard, resuspend in 1 ml PE buffer
** Spin, discard, resuspend in 1 ml PE buffer
** Spin, discard, spin again, remove remaining PE buffer with 10 &mu;l tip
** Dry at 50&deg; for 15 minutes until the Qiaex II turns white
** Resuspend in 30 &mu;l TE
** Spin, remove supernatent to a fresh tube with a 10 &mu;l tip
** Add an additional 10 &mu;l TE to the Qiaex II suspension, resuspend, spin
** Remove supernatent with a 10 &mu;l tip
** Spin down the fresh tube to pellet any remaining Qiaex II suspension and transfer supernatent to a screw to vial
** Measure concentration and label the tube
