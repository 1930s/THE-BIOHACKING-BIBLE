__TOC__

The general specifications of the characterisation of the Hrp is that:
* Four devices will be characterised.
*The characterisation will give various characterisation parameters for the relevant devices.
* The devices will be tested under several conditions and in several contexts.
 

== Parts and Devices ==
The Hrp system can be manipulated in a number of ways to create various devices. The aim of the characterisation of Hrp is to, characterise some of these potential devices. A prioritised list of Hrp devices that we would like to characterise is shown below:<br><br>

*[[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Projects/Hrp_System/Systems/Hrp_Device 1 |Device 1: One input]]
**Input 1: Activating HrpR and HrpS<br>

*[[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Projects/Hrp_System/Systems/Hrp_Device 2 |Device 2: Two inputs]]<br>
** Input 1: Activating HrpR and HrpS
** Input 2: Repressing using HrpV<br>

==Characterisation parameters==

At the end of characterisation all devices must have the following attributes defined:

*Transfer function: The relationship between and outputs
*Stability:         The life span of the system
*Response time:      The time taken for the system to react to a change 
*Recovery time: Time taken for system to return to unactivated state.
*Define threshold levels: Minimum and maximum input of PoPS into our system.
*Noise-Signal flucatuation and leakiness of device.

In addition these characterisations above will be determined for the individual inputs used, i.e. HrpR, HrpS and HrpV.

==Conditions==
Within the characterisation of each device, we wish to explore several parameters to further the characterisation and the knowledge of the Hrp system. The parameters we wish to test are:
*'''Temperature''' - The system will be tested for tolerance between 20-40 <sup>o</sup>C at 5 <sup>o</sup>C increments.
*'''pH''' - pH tolerance will be tested between acidic (pH 5), neutral (pH 7) and basic (pH 9) environments.
<br>
==Contexts==
*The primary chassis will be E.Coli K12 strain. The various types of E.coli chassie we wsh to characterise:
# E.Coli K12 strain - [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_V1002 BBa_V1002]
# E.Coli DH5a strain - [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_V1001 BBa_V1001]
# E.Coli MG1655 strain - [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_V1000 BBa_V1000]

*In addition we would like to characterise the Cell Free Expression System.

== Modular Design ==
We wish to show apply the characterised Hrp devies to modular design. We hope to use the BBa_F2620 and to design an optmised system with our device 1. By knowing the relevant information for both parts i.e. transfer functions, we should be able to predict the outcome of our design.
