==Miniprep of cultures==
 
*Transfer 1.5ml of culture into eppendorf tubes. 
*Spin for 20seconds and remove supernatant. 
*Take out Solution I and III from the fridge with syringes. Solution II (if it is cold it precipitates) is on the bench. (use yellow pipette for syringes) 
*Add 100ul of solution I and resuspend the pellet by vortexing. 
*Add 200ul of solution II. 
*Add 150ul of solution III.  
*Mix them well by inverting the tubes. White precipitates appears.  
*Spin for 3min. In the meantime, label tubes.  
*Pour the supernatants in to the new labelled tubes, add 1ml of ethanol and mix. 
*Spin for another 3min and remove supernatant. 
*Spin to remove residual liquid and then resuspend in 50ul of MiliQ (1 sec. vortex. Donâ€™t resuspend the pellet).  
*NB: If the culture was grown during the day (8hrs), then resuspend in 25{{uL}} to obtain approximately the same concentration.  
*Spin for 1min.  
*Ready to digest.
