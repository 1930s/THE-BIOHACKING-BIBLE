* '''If HU and Fis are produced at high levels in E. coli, do we need high levels of Hin in order to find the Hix sites? '''
* Which promoter should we use? If we use Lac, then we can turn on for a long time and it will stay on. If we use maltose, then induction will reduce over time. 
* Cre does not need any accessory proteins, then it may be a more efficient system to use?
* <u>ERIN</u> How can we turn Hin off quickly (using CRE or mutating HIX so that they stop after one reversal)?<br> [[Off answer]]
* <u>B-RAD</u> Do we want to be able to turn Hin on and off more than once?[[AnswerS]]<br>
* Should we create a transgenic E. coli with Hin and/or Cre in the chromosome so we won't need so many plasmids?<br>
* <u>SABRIYA</u> Does CRE flip once and is then done with that pancake, or will it be excised the next time?<br>
Well it seems we can stop CRE from inverting if we use two mutant LoxP sites. After they invert a wild type loxP site and a double mutant loxP site will be formed which is no longer recognizable by CRE. [[See Details]]<br>
* <u>ERIC</u> How many flips would the normal negative supercoiling of a plasmid in ''E. coli'' allow?  What happens to supercoiling if we make the plasmid larger? What happens to supercoiling during the stationary phase, relax? [[Supercoiling]]<br>
* <u>B-RAD</u> Can we alter the amount of negative supercoiling and thus the number of flips if necessary?[[AnswerA]] <br>
* <u>T-ODD </u> Can we apply EtBr to relax the number of supercoils and thus stop recombination?[[Answer T1]]<br>
* <u>ADAM</u> What should we use as the reporters? Fluorescent vs. Resistant pancake or combinations? [[Only a few points, still unanswered if others want to add more indepth research]]<br>
* Possible detection delays for both methods and how to minimize the delays<br>
* How can we gradually scale up the number of flips with the fewest number of constructs?<br>
* <u>ADAM</u> Can we use mutated lox or hix sites that will allow only single flips?[[Answer411]]<br>
* <u>T-ODD</u> Will a segment flip multiple times or will the enzymes move to new sites? [[Answer T2]]<br>
* <u>ADAM</u> Which version of hin are we going to use?[[Answer412]] <br>
* Are there any antibiotic genes with biobrick ends in the registry?
