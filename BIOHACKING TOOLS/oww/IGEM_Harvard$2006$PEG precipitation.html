==PEG precipitation==

*Make a stock solution of 20% PEG (w/v), 2.5 M NaCl.
**It may take a while to dissolve, but you can use a stir bar and low heat.
**For 10 mL solution: 2.0 g PEG, 1.46 g NaCl
*Add 0.25 volume of the PEG/NaCl solution to your folded nanostructure mix.
*Incubate on ice for 15 minutes
*Spin 16k rcf for 10 minutes
*Pipette out supernatant into separate tube
*Resuspend pellet in 1x folding buffer volume equal to the supernatant
*Run equivalent volumes of pellet and sup on 2% agarose gel (+ 11 mM MgCl2)
