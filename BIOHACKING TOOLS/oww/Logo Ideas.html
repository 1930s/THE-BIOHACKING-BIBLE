We really need a better logo to put on the front page.  Please post any ideas that you may have, whether they be in image form, written description, or spoken word.  Also, please feel free to put up any other ideas for slogans and motto's that you may have.

==Logo feedback==
I really like these logos. Maybe with an easier to read font?--[[User:Kathmc|Kathleen]] 11:52, 6 Sep 2005 (EDT)<br>
That could be done. Any font suggestions? And which one "Open" or "wetware" or both. More feedback, please. --[[User:Jennyn|Jenny]] 19:48, 6 Sep 2005 (EDT)

Maybe both words could be in some sort of "block" letters, not fancy/curvy. Not sure if this will work better, but worth a try to see. --[[User:Kathmc|Kathleen]] 18:14, 7 Sep 2005 (EDT)

Hey Jenny,
Jason and I both think that the twelfth image is the coolest longer image.  Like the block letters and how it is skinnier than the others.  Could you maybe do variations on the colors?  One suggestion would be black and red for the open (as in the 15th image posted), and blue for the wetware part (i'm not sure which blue looks best, blue like your third image, or blue like my WW's in smaller images with the genome... whatever you think works best). --[[User:Skosuri|Sri Kosuri]] 15:08, 10 Sep 2005 (EDT)

Bring back the flask! I really like the flask!--[[User:Kathmc|Kathleen]] 18:59, 12 Sep 2005 (EDT)

Great design Reshma!
An addendum to this idea is to have a back that just has something like

<nowiki>[[DNA Ligation]]  or [[Victor3 Plate Reader]] or [[Quantifying GFP Flourescence]] or [[Miller Assay]] </nowiki>

stuff like that.  

also, definitely need glossy!!!  --[[User:Skosuri|Sri Kosuri]] 12:18, 1 Dec 2005 (EST)

==Emblem ideas==

''(Random thoughts ... erase if you hate them.)''

#A DNA double helix wrapped around the world.
#Stick people spelling out A T G C (like YMCA :) ).
#A double helix that opens up (unwound) in the center, encircling a globe. (or a bunch of people, like a hogtie!!)
