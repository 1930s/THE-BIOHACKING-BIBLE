==Notes on OWW/New Class Format==

Postdoctoral fellows, and several faculty members of the Biochemistry Department and CROET participated in specific topic areas presented by the students in the class.  

==What is innovative about this class format?==
*(note: list is in progress and not in any order)
*Students receive feedback from peers, science faculty, and faculty mentors expert in communication/presentation 
*Each student has a chance to: lead the class, formally evaluate peers, present main topic and background
*Two chances were given for each student to perform each role to reinforce lessons and demonstrate improvement
*Papers, references, bonus materials and student slides presentations are posted on class wiki as a lasting reference
*Democratic and cumulative contributions to the class wiki 
*Students enjoyed competing to find and post the best bonus materials for the topic
*Any deficiencies identified in student presentations were corrected by the students and posted on wiki
*Papers covered were very recent so that students and faculty were both learning together, enhancing student “ownership” over the material
*Topics had a theme so that each session typically built on previous knowledge
*Format included informal class discussion before the formal presentations 
*Students were videotaped during their final presentation; viewed tapes to get perspective on their presenting styles
*Each student had to prepare and contribute to the class website before the class met.  This preparation enhanced participation in the class
*Students had control over major aspects of the class content and web site
*Instructors can easily monitor the class web site, quantify and track each student’s contribution and revert content if necessary
*Students had to work together ad hoc to reduce work-load, and to coordinate the presentations of background and main topic
*Students and teachers in other locations world wide observed the OHSU class via the Web 
*Individual student and faculty contributions can be tracked and quantified on the class wiki documenting effort for grading (students) and (faculty) promotion & tenure.
*The excellent OWW course template makes the class very easy to develop and organize
*Other courses running on OWW contain stimulating examples of new ideas and teaching tools specific for science education
*It would be possible to invite and engage the authors of selected topics or journal articles directly in discussion points

==The Stated Goals of the Class==
*Encourage students to seize every available resource for sifting and apprehending scientific matter (e.g., Nature podcasts, social bookmarking, RSS feeds, faculty, each other)
*Develop an appreciation for the molecular machines that duplicate nucleic acids
*Become familiar with collaborative web-based tools (OWW and wiki)
*Create ambassadors for open science
*Improve presentation skills, both in form and scientific content
*Engage in active group-based learning
*Gain leadership and organizational experience
*Build a shared web resource for information obtained in the class
