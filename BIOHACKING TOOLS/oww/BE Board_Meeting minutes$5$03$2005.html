==BE Bioethics (Kate, Nate, Nick, Maxine)==
*A lecture format wouldn’t be optimal, whereas a discussion-based event would be more formative & constructive.   
*We will invite speakers who would first give a short talk before mediating a student-fed discussion, which would make people think about bioethical issues, and get involved rather than passive. 
*Prof. [[Drew Endy]] is an excellent resource for us.   
*We will schedule these talks during the regular BE weekly seminar time slots, followed by social hour at the Muddy Charles.  This should boost attendance and interactions. 
*We will probe the audience to steer the next topics and get feedback about what people want to hear about, and who from. 
*Philosophy of science, ethical responsibility, but also authorship, proper use of animal experiments, intellectual property are a priori subjects of interest. 
 
==Community Service (Bree & Diana)==
*Bread & Jam on May 22, 2005 
 
==Social Events (Kathryn, Megan & Nate)==
*Ideas for future events include paint ball, picnic and frisbee in the Boston Commons, nitrogen ice cream, softball & BBQ, sailing, board games, chocolate making class, wine tasting 
*The GSC will be hosting an acoustic BBQ on Friday, May 13, 2005. 
 
==Budget (Diana)==
*Social: account for higher attendance, and possibly a BE semi-formal. 
*IM sports: fees & equipment, participation is very high, and increasing each year. 
*Mediation committee: its survival is up to Samantha & Charles. 
*Academics: The Industrial Seminar Series could feature two speakers whose travel expenses should be covered (one Medtronic officer, a WPI bioethics professor).  Additional funding will be seeked for advisor/advisee pizza hours, and career development/mentoring events. 
*Diversity: one “lunch + cultural activity” every other month. 
*BE Board meetings: same budget as this year.
