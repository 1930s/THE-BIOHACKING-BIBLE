== About the document ==

This document is an appendix of [[ISCB-SC:Website]]

'''Content inventory''' will help us to get an overview of: 

* content we have, link to source page
* the missing content/articles
* authors
* content status: draft, outdated, up-to-date
* delivery due date (deadline)
* delivery status: link, if integrated into new portal



'''WCT team members''' responsible for content:

* [[User:Neksa|Alexander]]
* [[User:manuelc|Manuel]]
* [[User:Nilsgehlenborg|Nils]] (I would like to see one rep from each RSG on this list!)
* [[User:Venkata|Venkata]]
* [[User:Parthi|Parthi]]


Please list the content we have in the table, linking to the source site. If it is not published, or you expect the link to be dead soon, please create a local wiki link in ISCB-SC:Website:Content namespace.

Then list missing content, e.g. articles that should be written.
