We have two emission filter slides for the plate reader since we can't fit all the filters we use on the one filter.  You can read more about the filter slides on page XX of the Victor3 hardware manual.

If you try and run your protocol and receive an error message saying the wrong emission filter is installed you can read how to change the slide in the manual.  We keep the unused filter slide wrapped in a paper towel in a ziploc bag in the trays just to the left of the plate reader computer.
