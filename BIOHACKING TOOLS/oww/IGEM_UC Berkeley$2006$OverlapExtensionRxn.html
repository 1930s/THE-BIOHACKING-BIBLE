'''Overlap extension reactions take two oligos with complementary 3' ends, and fill in the rest of the sequence with a polymerase.<br>
Any polymerase system will work for this (Taq, Vent, Expand, Pfu...)'''

#Make 100uM stocks of the oligos (the usual concentration for stocks, it's used here as 1x)
#Set up per extension reaction (it's ok to make a master mix of everything except the oligos, then split it and add the oligos--just make sure to add the polymerase after the buffer and dNTPs have been added)
  34 uL ddH2O
  5 uL 2mM in each dNTPs
  5 uL 10x ThermoPol buffer
  5 uL 100 uM oligo 1
  5 uL 100 uM oligo 2
  1 uL Vent polymerase
#Run the "wobble" program, which is:
  step 1:  2 min at 94
  step 2:  30 sec at 55 degC
  step 3:  30 sec at 72 degC
  step 4:  Got to 2 10 times
  step 5:  hold at 4 degC forever
'''Note that the wobble program is basically a short PCR program without extra denaturation steps'''
#There is nothing to see on a gel, so don't bother, just go into the [[IGEM:UC_Berkeley/2006/Short_DNA_cleanup | short DNA cleanup]] procedure.
