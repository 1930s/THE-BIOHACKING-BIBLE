|general= '''Education''': I grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin and studied Chemical Engineering and Biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. At the end of college I received some funding from Cancer Research UK and the US National Science Foundation, so I spent a year in England studying Computational Biology at the University of Cambridge. <br\ > 

'''Research''': I'm interested in different levels of cellular modeling, mainly to cure cancer. <br\ > 

'''Hobbies''': When I'm not in 26-007, a.k.a. The Dungeon, a.k.a. Gangsta's Paradise, you can probably find me watching The Newshour with Jim Lehrer or The Daily Show on my laptop, reading my weekly copy of The Economist, or getting lost in a foreign city. I've lived in Germany, Austria, and England, and traveled in 16 other countries. In the near future I'd like to diffuse through Singapore, Bangkok, Shanghai, and Tokyo, though convective forces may be required. On the science side, I have a growing interest at the hyperplane of biology, computer science, physics, and philosophy, in the vein of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener Norbert Wiener], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach Douglas Hofstadter], and [http://star.tau.ac.il/~eshel/Bio_complexity/1.Introduction/Schrodinger-What%20is%20Life.pdf Erwin Schr√∂dinger].<br\ >
