[[Image:KhturnerSelf.jpg|thumb|right|240 px|Me at the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Steps Spanish Steps] in Rome, July '06]]I am a Ph.D. student in the [http://micro.med.harvard.edu/ Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics] at [http://www.harvard.edu/ Harvard University], under the [http://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/bbs/ Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS) Program].  I am interested in pathogenic bacteria, and have tried many times in many different ways to narrow that a bit, but it's tough!  Luckily, my first year in the program here consists of lab rotations, so I can explore a bit before I declare a thesis topic.  I hope to contribute much of what I learn in the coming years to OWW.
==Education==
*Ph.D. Candidate in [http://micro.med.harvard.edu/ Microbiology and Molecular Genetics] at [http://www.harvard.edu/ Harvard University].
*B.S. with honors in [http://www.medicine.uiowa.edu/microbiology/ Microbiology], [http://www.uiowa.edu/ University of Iowa], May 2006
*B.S. in [http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/ Computer Science], [http://www.uiowa.edu/ University of Iowa], May 2006.
==Research==
===Rotations at Harvard===
*With [http://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/bbs/fac/dove.html Simon L. Dove, Ph.D.]: Coming soon! (January '06 - )
*With [http://lorylab.med.harvard.edu/ Stephen Lory, Ph.D.]: Performed a transposon mutagenesis screen in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''] to look for novel transcriptional repressors of type III secretion exoenzymes in the RsmA/RsmZ regulatory pathway (September '06 - December '06)
===Undergraduate work with [http://www.medicine.uiowa.edu/microbiology/faculty/apicella.htm Michael A. Apicella, M.D.]===
In the Apicella lab, I worked briefly on cloning [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisella_tularensis ''Francisella tularensis''] genes for cell division and LPS biogenesis, but the main bulk of my work there was on non-typeable [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilus_influenzae ''Haemophilus influenzae''].

NTHi is an obligate colonizer of the human upper respiratory tract, and is carried by about 80% of the population asymptomatically.  However, in patients with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder] or other immunocompromising conditions, it can cause acute episodes of bronchitis.  The basis for its high carriage rates and persistence in infection is in its use of ''N''-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sialic_acid sialic acid], for decorating its [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharides lipooligosaccharide] to evade the host [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immunity innate immune response].  As the bacterium lacks a Neu5Ac synthase gene, it depends on scavenging free Neu5Ac from the human host, a process which is mediated by the SiaP/SiaT Neu5Ac TRAP transporter <cite>Allen-IandI-2005</cite>.  SiaP is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periplasm periplasmic] protein that binds Neu5Ac and enables transport through the SiaT inner membrane transporter.

My work centered around characterizing the SiaP-Neu5Ac interaction quantitatively.  It was a great project that taught me a lot about microbiological and biochemical procedures, as well as more general things about performing and communicating research.  Unfortunately, we were scooped on the initial work <cite>Severi-MolMicro-2005</cite>, but we have a paper in the works that builds on what we did by examining the active site more closely.
