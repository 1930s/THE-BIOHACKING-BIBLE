==To Do==
*See about making competent DB3.1 cells
*Test the top10 stock with a + control (pUC18)
*See what we can do with BB'd E0240 & I2057

==Promoter Testers==
*Should pick some promoters to drop in.
*R0040 + a strong promoter + a weak promoter
*Using <bbpart>R0040</bbpart> and two of Anderson's promoters: <bbpart>J23116</bbpart> (weak) and <bbpart>J23100</bbpart> (strong)
*Using Joey's transformation of the promoters.

==I2055==
*Doing directional-dependent colony PCR (E0040_Reverse and either VF or VR)
