==Physical Components==
===Promoter===
[[Image:Promoter.jpg|thumb|left|A Promoter]]
*DNA sequence that act as an upstream initiator for transcription of a gene
*If a promoter is active, the downstream genes will be transcribed from DNA to RNA and the RNA can then be translated into proteins
*If a promoter is repressed, the downstream genes are not transcribed therefore no protein is produced
*Promoters are generally labelled with a P followed by a subscript that provides information about the promoter. For example, the P<sub>''trc-2''</sub> promoter in the toggle switch is a fusion of promoters from the tryptophane (the ''tr'' part) and lac (the ''c'' part) genes
*For more info, see the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter/ Wikipedia entry]
===Gene===
[[Image:Gene.jpg|thumb|left|A Gene]]
*DNA sequence that codes for a particular protein
*Is transcribed into RNA which is translated into a protein
*For our purposes, a gene is essentially a blueprint for a component of our system and through the promoter, we can choose when the component is produced
*Again, see the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene/ Wikipedia Entry] for more detailed information if you want

===Protein===
[[Image:Protein.jpg|thumb|left|A Protein]]
*A string of amino acids whose sequence is determined by the gene code they were assembled from
*Form complex 3D shapes that affect the function of the protein
*While genes are confined to the nucleus of a cell, proteins can generally diffuse around and even out of the cell
*As always, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein/ Wikipedia Entry] has far more information than I can give here

==Actions==
===Positive action===
[[Image:Activator.jpg|thumb|left]]
*Indicates that the action is a positive one
*Eg. This arrow from a gene to a protein shows that the gene produces the protein
*Eg. This arrow from a protein to a promoter shows that the protein interacts with the promoter to activate it, causing the genes downstream of the promoter to be expressed
===Negative action===
[[Image:Repressor.jpg|thumb|left]]
*Indicates that the action is a negative one ie. the first component is inhibiting the second component from acting somehow
*Eg. This arrow from a protein to a promoter means that the protein interacts with the promoter to prevent downstream genes from being expressed
*Eg. This arrow from a temperature to a protein means that at that temperature, the protein will not function
