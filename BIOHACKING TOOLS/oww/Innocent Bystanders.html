===Lab Specific Chemical Hygiene Training===

Although you will not be doing benchwork, you must still complete the [[Lab Specific Chemical Hygiene Training]] so that you are aware of the hazardous of your work environment (the lab) and to educate you on Emergency Procedures. 

This training must be updated annually and is equivalent to the [[Lab Specific Training]] that is required for those doing benchwork.
