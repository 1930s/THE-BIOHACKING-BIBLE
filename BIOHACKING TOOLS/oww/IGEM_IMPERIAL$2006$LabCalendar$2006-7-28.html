==Mini-prep attempt number 2==
*Parts 2H (I13033), 16P (J04500), 5M (C0060)cultured previous day [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/Protocols/mini_prep_of_culture|mini-preped]].
*DNA extracted and [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/Protocols/20ul_digestion|digested]].
*Gel elecrophoresis resulted in the following bands.
<br>

<br>
The four lanes show DNA markers,  2H, 5M and 16P from left to right. 
Individual band sizes correspond to their respective plasmid and parts sizes as listed in registry. <br>
Parts successfully cultured in bacteria. Ready for ligations.

==Ligations==
*Re washed DNA with gene clean wash protocol
*Electroporated the following into competent cells
**I13504(insert) into C0261(vector)
**I13504(insert) into I13033(vector)
**C0062(insert) into B0034(vector)
**1I from parts registry

Note that the gene clean wash to purify the DNA from ligase needs to be the altered version of protocol
*Add equal volume of 6M NaI instead of 500 uL
*Skip 5 minute incubation in step 2
*Elute in 20 uL in step 10
*Remove 15 uL of supernatant in step 12
*Respin and take out 10 uL from that to a new eppendorf tube...this will be the DNA we use for the electroporation

==To do over weekend==
*Dr. Mann will collect plates from the 37C incubator on Saturday
*Miniprep parts electroporated today on Sunday
