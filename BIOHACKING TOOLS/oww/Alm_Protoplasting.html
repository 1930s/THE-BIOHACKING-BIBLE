==Materials for 1 protoplasting run==

*W1: Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 0.01M, washing solution 1, 3x wash volume so ~30ml
*R1: Tris-HCl + 0.5M sucrose, 30ml
*EDTA, 0.1M, 3.3ml
*SMM = sucrose, 0.5M , , 30 + 3x wash volume, so ~60ml
**W2: SMM for washing, 3x wash volume so ~30ml
**R2: SMM + lysozyme 1 mg/ml, 30ml

*R3: TSB + 0.5M sucrose, resuspension and dilution for plating, also need some for plating control with original cells 50 ml?  
*TSB + 0.5M sucrose + 0.8% agarose

*50 ml Falcon tube, 1 per protoplast type
*25 ml serological pipets
*P1000
*P20
*plates

===Regeneration:===

soft agar (0.8%) plates containing 

In some cases, protoplasts were resus- 
pended in LB medium containing 0.5 M sucrose and 
spread onto soft agar plates containing LB medium and 
0.5 M sucrose with autoclaved plastic spreaders. The 
plates were subsequently incubated at either 25 or 37 1C. 

In other cases, the protoplasts were diluted into molten 
soft agar at 45 1C containing either LB medium and 
0.5 M sucrose or M9 medium, 0.5 M sucrose, and either 
Leu (100 mg/ml) or Arg (100 mg/ml), depending on the 
nutritional requirements of the auxotrophic strains used, 
and then poured onto soft agar plates of the same 
composition.

==Materials==
List reagents, supplies and equipment necessary to perform the protocol here.  For those materials which have their own OWW pages, link to that page.  Alternatively, links to the suppliers' page on that material are also appropriate.

*supply 1 (i.e. tubes of a certain size? spreaders?)
*reagent 1
*X &mu;L reagent 2
**component A (reagent 2 is made up of multiple components)
**component B
*equipment 1
*equipment 2

==Procedure==
===Strip outer membrane===
#Pellet cells
#Pour off supernatant
#Resuspend in Tris-HCl
#Add EDTA slowly
#Shake
#Pellet and rinse

===Permeabilize cell wall===
#Pellet, rinse with SMM, resuspend in SMM + lysozyme
#Shake and incubate
*No current step to stop lysozyme
*Should have protoplasts now

===Optional: Fuse protoplasts===
#Mix aliquots of protoplasts of each parent strain
#Add PEG
#Step 3 

===Regenerate protoplasts===
#Step 1
#Step 2
#*Step 2 has some additional information that goes with it.  i.e. Keep at 4&deg;C.
#Step 3
##Step 3 has multiple sub-steps within it.
##Enumerate each of those.
