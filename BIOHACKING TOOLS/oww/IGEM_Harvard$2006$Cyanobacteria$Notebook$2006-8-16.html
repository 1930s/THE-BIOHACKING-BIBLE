== To-do ==
* Western blots
** <s>Inoculate several cultures of GFP dev. for Western blotting this afternoon</s>
** <s>Take regular measurements of culture OD</s>
** Western blot '''(delayed until tomorrow because we don't seem to have GFP)'''
* Construct creation
** <s>Restreak and do colony PCRs of the Kai\X-P + J04500\S-P transformants to check if our insert is there</s>
** <s>Midiprep the KaiA/B/C in GA plasmid that we grew up from frozen stocks yesterday</s>
*** <s>Digest a large amount of KaiA/B/C\X-P</s>
*** Gel-purify
** RBS + KaiC construct
*** <s>Miniprep the B0034 cultures</s>
*** <s>Digest B0034\S-P</s>
*** Gel-purify
*** Ligate KaiC\X-P + B0034\S-P
*** Transform KaiC\X-P + B0034\S-P

==Miniprep of B0034==
Title says it all; 2 60uL samples of B0034 in the freezer, and glycerol stock.

== Inoculation R0010 + E0241 ==

10 inoculations of the R0010 + E0241 were made:

:* 10 mL LB amp & 1 ul R0010 + E0241
:* 10 mL LB amp & 1 ul R0010 + E0241 (IPTG - not yet added)
:* 10 mL LB amp & 8 ul R0010 + E0241
:* 10 mL LB amp & 8 ul R0010 + E0241 (IPTG - not yet added)
:* 10 mL LB amp & 64 ul R0010 + E0241
:* 10 mL LB amp & 64 ul R0010 + E0241 (IPTG - not yet added)
:* 10 mL LB amp & 256 ul R0010 + E0241
:* 10 mL LB amp & 256 ul R0010 + E0241 (IPTG - not yet added)
:* 10 mL LB amp & 4.1 mL R0010 + E0241
:* 10 mL LB amp & 4.1 mL R0010 + E0241 (IPTG - not yet added)

== Midiprep of KaiABC ==

The KaiABC genes were eluted (redissolved) in 200 mL of H<sub>2</sub>O.

:* KaiA: 279.1 ng/uL
:* KaiB: 285.2 ng/uL
:* KaiC: 409.7 ng/uL + 409.5 ng/uL

==Ligation test and replating==

We had 18 colonies grow up; see the image at the right. For each of these, I plated and did a colony PCR to test for the insert. For the first 8, I also innoculated, though it may not work.

[[Image: plates_81606.jpg|thumb|right]]

Each reaction:
* 8 µL PCR Supermix
* 1 µL VF2 primers @ 2uM 
* 1 µL VR primers @2uM
* colony or 1 uL template or nothing

19 RXNS: (18 + 1 pos, which is B0034)
* 8*20=160uL supermix
* 1*20 = 20uL VF2
* 1*20 = 20uL VR

PCR schedule:
* 95C for 15'00
* Do 30 times:
** 95C for 0'30
** 55C for 0'30
** 72C for 2'00
* 72C for 10'00
* 4C forever


'''Results:'''

I'm confused.... the + control is B0034 (the RBS), for reference; the actual coding sequence is i think 33bp or something really short, so basically add on the size of the band in the gel to the expected KaiA,B,and C sizes.

'''EDIT:''' Actually, the previous ligation was not a self-ligation like thought. Look at http://www.openwetware.org/wiki/Image:2006_08_14_egel2.jpg, we expect a 550 bp band (like + control) if it self-ligated but it actually is a 300bp band...

''EXPECTED''
*KaiA from VF to VR2: 855bp + 536bp (VF2-VR on J04500) - 6bp+20bp (prefixes) = 1.4kb
*KaiB: 309bp + 536bp (VF2-VR on J04500) - 6bp+20bp (prefixes) = 859bp
*KaiC: 1560bp + 536bp (VF2-VR on J04500) - 6bp+20bp (prefixes) = 2110bp
*B0034 Positive: 250bp (VF2-VR) = 250bp
*Nothing: 536bp

== Innoculation of GFP Device from Nick's Plate ==
4 Innoculations were made of GFP (R0010 + E0241) from Nick's bright green plate.  The cells could be dead, though, so no guarantees.  All 4 innoculations were made in 10mL LB + Amp.  Also made a negative control of 10mL LB + Amp.
