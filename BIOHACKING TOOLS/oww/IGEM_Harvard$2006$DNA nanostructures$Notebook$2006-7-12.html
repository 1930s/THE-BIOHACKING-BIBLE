Results from [[IGEM:Harvard/2006/DNA_nanostructures/Notebook/2006-7-11|7/11]] Thrombin-Binding Experiment
* gels removed at 10:00 am: appear to have run off the gel (very hard to tell since they were so faint to begin with)
* removed gels from plastic
** cut bottom of gel where it sticks out of narrow hole at the bottom
** pried two plastic sides apart (gel now stuck to one side)
** loosen top edge by sliding flat tool under it a bit.
** make sure the very bottom is completely cut
** run it under water over the a plastic tupperware container - move it back and forth left to right - eventually the gel should come free into the container. 
** hold the gel in the container while you pour the water out.
* stained with [http://www.piercenet.com/Objects/View.cfm?type=ProductFamily&ID=02051015 GelCode Blue Stain] (Coomassie blue) (in brown bottle in first 4{{c}} fridge)
** pour enough Coomassie blue over it to cover the gel. 
** put the lid on the tupperware and put it on the rocker for about 20 minutes.

Protein- and DNA-staining control experiment
* goal: to load varying concentrations of thrombin onto a gel and stain with Coomassie blue in an attempt to image the protein, and various concentrations of DNA onto a gel and stain with a yet-to-be determined stain to image the DNA

* all reagents were mixed in individual 0.2 mL PCR tubes
* 10-20% Invitrogen polyacrylamide gel run at 25 V for 2.5 h.
[[Image:Run_stop.JPG|thumb|Why today was a complete bust (photo shows run/stop in ''correct'' configuration)]]
* gel catridge opened and cut between protein and DNA sections
** was cut before removal from one side of cartridge and led to some tearing during removal from that side, cut after removal next time
* protein section was rocked in GelCode Blue Stain for 1 hr.
* DNA section was rocked in 100 mL Tris-glycine buffer with 10 {{ul}} of 10 mg/mL ethidium bromide for 1 hr.
* '''results'''
** loading dye diffused about 3 mm in all directions into the gel
** neither the protein nor the DNA imaged on the gel
* '''discussion'''
** when you don't press the "run/stop" button on the power supply so that the light next to "run" is lit, you're not supplying any power for electrophoresis. we hadn't.
