Working with bacteriophage &lambda;

==Preparing Host Cells==
Select an appropriate strain of ''E. Coli'' and adjust growth media as needed. For this protocol the strain is XL1 Blue MRA

#Grow an overnight culture in [[Oneill_Lab:Media#LB|LB]] supplemented with Mg<sup>2+</sup> at 37&deg;C shaking
#Pellet the cells at 2000 rcf for 5 minutes, and remove media
#Resuspend cells in 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> to an OD<sub>600</sub> &asymp; 0.5
#*Resuspended cells can be stored at 4&deg;C and will last about 2 days


==Plating Lambda==
High titer phage stock can be kept at 4&deg;C for about 6 months.

#Heat [[Oneill_Lab:Media#LB|LB]] or NZY agar plates supplemented with Mg<sup>2+</sup> to 37&deg;C.
#Melt LB or NZY top agar supplemented with Mg<sup>2+</sup> and keep at 50&deg;C until ready to use.
#*Top agar is made by adding 0.7% agar to media
#*Melt top agar thoroughly. Small particles will give plates a rough surface.
#Add about 4 &mu;L of a high titer phage stock to 200 &mu;L resuspended cells.
#Incubate at 37&deg;C for 15 minutes to allow phage to attach to cell walls.
#Add cells to 3 ml top agar and plate immediately.
#*Top agar will solidify rapidly, tilt plate to spread evenly.
#*Be sure top agar has cooled to 50&deg;C before adding cells.
#Incubate at 37&deg;C for 14-16 hours or until plaques grow to desired size
