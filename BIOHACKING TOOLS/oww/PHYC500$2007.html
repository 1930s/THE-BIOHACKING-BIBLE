==Welcome to the wiki site for our seminar series on Biophysics and Medicine!==
'''Check the [[PHYC500/2007:Help|Help page]] for information on how to officially enroll in the course.'''

The entire OWW site (of which this course is a part) is viewable by the entire world but editable only by registered users.

Any page that begins with "PHYC500/2007" is a page we have created specifically for this course.  If you create a page (please do!) and it is intended for this course, then make sure is starts with "PHYC500/2007".  For example, [[PHYC500/2007:Sandbox]].


===How to participate===
If you are enrolled or want to participate, you should do this (others, please edit to make more clear!):
#Get an account on OpenWetWare.  Go here: [[OpenWetWare:How_to_join]].  In the box for "why to join" just say you're in this course (UNM: Physics 500, Steve Koch instructor).  Shouldn't be any problem.
#Figure out the basics of wiki.  Try here: [[PHYC500/2007:Sandbox]], you can do whatever you want to this page.
#Set up your user page.  See the top of the page, click on your name to edit.  Maybe put your name, major, etc.  A picture would be great.
#Contribute!  Maybe a good start is here: [[PHYC500/2007:Interactions]]

===Goals of the wiki===
*Encourage more discussions about the seminars or just about biophysics or science in general
*Place to put links to slides or supplemental information
*Other?
