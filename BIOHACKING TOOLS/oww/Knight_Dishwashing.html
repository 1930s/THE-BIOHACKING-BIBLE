==Cleaning glassware==

#Dirty glassware and plasticware goes on the carts.  
#*There is one outside of 32-306 and inside 32-311.
#Periodically, wheel the carts to the dishwasher in 32-322 and load the glassware into the dishwasher.
#*Cylinders must be handwashed.  They won't get washed properly in the dishwasher.
#*Before you start a load, also check 32-316 to see if there are gel trays and combs that need to be washed.
#Add Alconox dishwashing detergent to the soap container and outside the soap container.  
#*Don't add too much detergent or it won't all dissolve in the wash.
#Start the dishwasher on the heavy cycle (setting 2).
#Set the cardboard sign on the dishwasher to clean.
#Once finished, unload the dishwasher onto the table next to the autoclaves.
#Add autoclave tape to each piece of glassware.
#*Doing this immediately helps to identify the glassware as clean.
#*Fold a side of the autoclave tape under to make it easy to remove later.
#Beakers and cylinders can be covered with foil and autoclave tape added to the foil.
#If available, load autoclavable glassware and plasticware into the clean autoclave.
#*Make sure the lids are loose.
#Sterilize the glassware for 1hr at 121&deg;C.
#Once the autoclave cycle is finished and the pressure returns to zero, open the autoclave.  If the autoclave is still hot, the heat should dry the glassware.  
#If the glassware and plasticware is still wet, move it to the oven (on the ground, next to the autoclave).
#Heat in the oven for 1 hr at 50&deg;C.
#Replace the glassware to the appropriate cabinets.

==Some things to remember==
#Do not wash cylinders in the dishwasher.  You must wash them by hand.
#Do not put clean glassware on the dirty glassware cart.  Otherwise, it will just get washed again.
#Do not overload the dishwasher with detergent.
#Do not leave dirty glassware in the sink.
