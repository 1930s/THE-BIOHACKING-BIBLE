== Announcements ==
I have been invited to do a 30 minute talk at the January AAPT meeting covering the optical trap.  We've made a few modifications to the design, tried some new labs, and had quite a few students use the trap in the past year.  I'll post talk details as they come up.

Just returned from the AAPT meeting in Syracuse, NY.  I had an excellent time and greatly enjoyed talking with everyone who stopped by the poster.  If you stopped by and had further questions or a material request, please contact me at dapple [at] mit [dot] edu.  Thanks again for the interest and the suggestions!

Working on the revisions for the paper.  Re-submission should occur in the next few weeks.  Still have a few kinks to iron out.

The AJP paper will be submitted in the upcoming week or two.  If you are anxious to start building, please contact me about getting a draft version of the article.  --[[User:Dapple|dapple]] 22:53, 26 February 2006 (EST)
