==Email notification of new papers ==

[http://www.biomail.org/ BioMail] and [http://pubcrawler.gen.tcd.ie/ PubCrawler] are websites which enable you to set up automatic searches of PubMed with specified queries.  It will automatically email you any new results from those searches.  You can specify multiple complex queries and exercise some control over how frequently you receive mail.  This is a good way to monitor new papers in a specific area or by particular authors.
