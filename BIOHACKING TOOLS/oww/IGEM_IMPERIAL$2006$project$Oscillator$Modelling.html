These pages are designed as a guide to modelling the oscillator. 
The different tabs designate different sections in the modelling and separate various types of models from each other.

The following models can be found: 
:1.  Pure Lotka-Volterra Modelling
:2.  Modelling of all test contructs/components of the oscillator
