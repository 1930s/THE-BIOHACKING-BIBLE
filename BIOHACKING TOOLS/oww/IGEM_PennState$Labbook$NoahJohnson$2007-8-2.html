*Ordered UV cuvettes
*Began growing up 6 3ml cultures of crp* in LB
*Will TELT dna prep them tonight or tomorrow

<h2>M9 Minimal Media (250mL each):</h2>

For ~250mL of media and a final 0.2% sugar concentration:
*200mL sterile water 

*50mL of 5X M9 salts
*#12.8g Na2HP04*7H2O
*#3g KH2PO4
*#0.5g NaCl
*#1g NH4Cl
*#Dissolve in 200mL deionized water and autoclave to sterilize
*3.75g BactoAgar

Autoclave to sterilize and allow to cool until you can hold it for 2 seconds on the palm of your hand. Then add the following and pour into plates:

*25mL sugar solution
*#Add 0.5g glucose/xylose to 25mL sterile water
*#Filter-sterilize before adding
*#Makes a 12.5% sugar solution and a 0.2% overall glucose/xylose media
*500 uL 1M MgSO4
*#Dissolve 24.65g MgSO4*7H20 in 100mL H20
*#Autoclave to sterilize
*25uL 1M CaCl2
*#Dissolve 14.7 g CaCl2*2H2O in 100mL H2O
*#Autoclave to sterilize

I will make 250mL of each of the following:
*0.2% glucose
*0.2% glucose + 0.2% xylose
*0.2% xylose
*0.2* glycerol (- control)
