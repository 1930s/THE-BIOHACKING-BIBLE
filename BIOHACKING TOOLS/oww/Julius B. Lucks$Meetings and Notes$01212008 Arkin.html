= ColE1 System - Engineerable transcriptional control =

* idea - want to genericise '''transcriptional''' control
* currently, theoretically, if want to build more complicated genetic networks, need more parts (promoters, terminators, etc.)
** problems - each have their own kinetics
** not necessarily orthogonal
** to build something up, have to do massive characterization, then put together, then tweak to get to work together
* parts proliferation problem
** every gate in the system has to be made up of a different non-interacting promoter, etc.
** still need to be tuned
* one approach is the big FAB approach (Knight, Endy) - 
** build massive libraries of promoters and characterize them all in different cell contexts
** then in multiple RBS contexts
** then in multiple terminator contexts
** might have enough characterization then to be able to build something up
** HUGE cost, and not sure will work
** probably something like will first do on 10 most popular things, then stop there
* '''want to make the building of complicated system more amenable to predictable design'''
* another approach via RNA engineering - translational control
** '''Smolke''' - ribozymes - recognize metabolite - change conformation - allow translation
** Benenson - RNAi governing transcript stability
** these have been working in eukaryotes - mostly metazoans actually

== ColE1 - RNA control of transcription via antisense interaction ==
* what if we could use antisense interaction (like RNAi) to control transcritption
* see image to understand the system (1)
** ColE1 (72 bp region) - high copy number replication origin in E. coli (we actually use this in the lab)
** when transcribed, forms some complicated secondary structure that allows polymerase to carry on, so ON by default
** if certain antisense piece of RNA added, will bind to this, causing a DIFFERENT RNA secondary structure down the line, which does not allow polymerase to pass
*** natural NOT gate
** true antisense mechanism - does not require other proteins to work
** looks designable
*** could change the ColE1 sequence to recognize different key anti-sense sequences
*** hopefully be able to do this with simple anti-sense matching
*** hopefully be able to keep GC-content the same so that the thermodynamics would not change too much
*** want many different (so orthogonal) ColE1 regions so can put them together in different ways

== Initial Targets ==
* recreate original experiments
* try to find a sequence with a stronger repression factor
* prove orthogonal (2)
** put 2 orthogonal ColE1s behind two genes - 2 diff inputs, make sure only one on for each input
* reconstruct collins switch (3)
** get one system to produce anti-sense of the other
** to get this to work, would have to make sure the system is cooperative
** would need to measure the induction curve - if sigmoidal, see what can do with it

== Applications ==
* since this is RNA mediated, doesn't matter where the RNA comes from
** could come from cancer cells (which are known to over-express certain RNAs)
** would have to design ColE1s to recognize these specific sequences
* the best papers make a new type of part - more powerful - more computation power - some application for these cells
** RNAi logic, Molecular turing machines - Kobi Benenson
** lots of power
** beyond Adelman
** more towards what I want to do
* figure out need computational power X to do thing Y - put in an application context

== Problems ==
* currently only about a 3-fold repression - not that much
* may not be an anti-sense thing - could be something more complicated (Chris Anderson seemed to indicate)
* could be that the dynamic range is poor
* kinetics could be poor
* could be good for a NOT gate, but might need more logic on the promoter (like promoters that have several inputs - do an integration right there)

== TOREAD ==
* talk to Anthony Carruthers (looking at changing mRNA degradation rates)
** also Jonathan Golder
** also David Tulga - works w/ Anderson - Xis and Int recombination systems
** alos Chris Anderson about RNA genes
* big ColE1 people in europe
** Sabin Brandtl
** Gerhard Wagner
* which papers like and why - which ones are the most exciting

== Random Notes ==
* other systems kind of like this
** SacT terminator of B. subtilis - sacT binds to hairpin and opens
*** anti-termination with no modifications of the polymerase
* iGEM - FMN - translational control
** were trying to avoid the protein part - just another step to worry abou engineering
* Niles Pierce - multi-stranded RNA systems
