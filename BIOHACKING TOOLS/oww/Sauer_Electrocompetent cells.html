'''Preparing electrocompetent cells:'''
# Make a 1/100X dilution of your overnight culture into fresh medium (and add antibiotics if desired).
# Grow your culture to an OD<sub>600 nm </sub> ~ 0.5-0.7.
# Meanwhile, chill sterile water and a sterile 10% glycerol solution at 4&deg;C.
##''For a 1 L culture I'd chill 500 mL of water and 100 mL of 10% glycerol, and this is more than enough.'':[[User:Marylee|Marylee]] 23:04, 27 November 2006 (EST)
# Place your cultures over ice, ~15'.
# Spin at 4000 rpm, 15', and dump the supernatant.
# Gently resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of chilled, sterile water.  Transfer to a 50 mL Falcon tube and fill it with more water.
# Spin at 4000 rpm, 15', and dump the supernatant.
# Repeat this resuspension-spin cycle four times, the final time using your 10% glycerol solution.
# Resuspend your pellet in 500 &mu;L of 10% glycerol.
# Aliquot 60 &mu;L into eppendorf tubes and freeze at -80&deg;C until use.


'''Electroporation:'''
# Thaw your aliquot of electrocompetent cells on ice and transfer them to an electroporation cuvette.
# Add 1 &mu;L of DNA, or whatever else your introducing, to your cells.
# Electroporate according to the specifications of your equipment and sample.
# Quickly add 1 mL of medium (lacking antibiotics) to the cuvette and then transfer to an eppendorf.
# Cure cells by shaking at 37&deg;C (or whatever temperature you would use to plate your cells) for ~1 hour.
# Gently pellet cells by spinning at 4000 rpm, 3'.
# Resuspend the pellet in roughly 150 uL of supernatant and plate on selective medium.
