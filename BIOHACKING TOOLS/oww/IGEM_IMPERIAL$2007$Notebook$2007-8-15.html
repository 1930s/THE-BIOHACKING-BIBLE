==Preparation of Cell Extract==
#Innoculated 45 ml of fresh overnight culture in 1 litre 2xYT medium 
#Incubated at 37&deg;C until O.D. 600 = 0.600
#Added 5 ml of 1 mM IPTG
#Incubated at 37&deg;C
#*O.D. 600 was 1.543 at 6pm 
#Culture left at 37&deg; in the incubator overnight
#Incubated new 100 ml culture overnight

==Midiprep of Biobricks==
#Midipreped 9 Biobricks

==Pilot Preparation of Vesicles==
*'''Results''':

The vesicles prepared the [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Notebook/2007-8-14#Pilot Preparation of Vesicles | day before]] were looked at once again under a light microscope, with phase contrast. This time, vesicles were observed, with size range 2-43&mu;m.

*'''Preparations''': The desiccation and suspension stages of the vesicle preparation protocol were carried out once again.
#One 100ml beaker was prepared with 125&mu;l of DOPC in 50ml of mineral oil
#The suspension was sonicated for 30mins and left overnight in a 27&deg;C incubator
*It was later found that the desiccator had no vacuum
