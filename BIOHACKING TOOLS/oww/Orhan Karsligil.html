==About Me==
I am a research scholar working in [http://openwetware.org/wiki/Stephanopoulos_Lab Prof. Gregory Stephanopoulos' lab]. I am mostly interested in complex networks and pattern discovery. You can read more on my background and previous research at my online [http://karsligil.homeip.net:8000/~okarsligil/wordpress/about-me/ resume]

For now you can visit my blog at: [http://www.karsligil.com Orhan's Blog] for more information. I will update this site with my current research and research resources.

==Resources==
In this section I plan to collect some useful online resources.
===My Paper Collection===
I am using a site called [http://www.citeulike.org/ CiteULike] to keep track of all the papers I am reading or planning to read. One can tag papers, create bibliographies automatically and one can also upload the PDFs so that they can be retrieved anytime one desires. You can find my collection of papers (only the user can access the PDFs because of the copyright issues) at [http://www.citeulike.org/user/okarsligil Orhan's Paper Collection]

===Biology News===

[http://www.biologynews.net/ Biology News Net] is a very useful Biology News collection site.

===Software===
[http://bioinformatics.org/software/index.php3 This site (http://bioinformatics.org/software/index.php3)] has a long list of links to Bioinformatics software.

===Online Databases===
Here I will add the online Gene, Protein, Metabolite databases

===Algorithms===
Here I will add algorithm sites that might be useful for bioinformatics type of computations.

===Research Groups===
Research groups that I follow for interesting research.
===Online Courses===
Here I am planning to add links to some online course materials that I find very useful.

===The Inner Life of the Cell===
Developed for Harvard Biology Classes. A very nice introduction of the inner workings of a cell...

===Protein Synthesis===
A video from 1971, done at UCSD... I believe this cannot be done anymore.. Nobody would participate... 35 years later I am curious what initiator one is doing...
