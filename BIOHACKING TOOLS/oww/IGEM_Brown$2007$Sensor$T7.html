Hey Tito,

The T7 promoter has a low background if you can keep the expression of
T7 RNAP relatively low, in which case it will be rare that it will
find its promoter.  So you need a promoter that you can turn
relatively off, hook that up to T7 RNAP and then use a T7 promoter to
control the gene you want to have tightly off.

Warning: T7 RNAP is highly active so if you make a lot of it, your
cells are likely to stop growing assuming there is a T7 promoter for
the RNAP to bind to.

The two key papers on using T7 RNA polymerase and promoter for the
expression of cloned genes are attached.

There are E. coli strains that have T7 RNAP integrated into the
chromosome (BL21(DE3)).  Novagen sell plasmids that have T7 promoters
in them.

The relevant BioBricks are -

I2032 - sequence verified by me, not yet tested.
R0085 - consensus T7 promoter sequence.  Tested by me and working.

Hope this gets you started,

Barry
