* loaded in two gels
* ran at 130V for 30 min.
* stained on in silver stain (fixative time: ~25 min., staining time: ~15 min.), the other in SYBR gold (see [[IGEM:Harvard/2006/Gel_staining|protocols]])
* results/discussion:
** silver stains these DNAs negatively (background stains but DNAs do not)
*** sensitive to 13,900 pg = 1,000 fmols (hardly visible in photograph, but visible on gel)
*** this is poor sensitivity
** SYBR gold stains to 1,390 pg = 100 fmols
*** photograph was clearer with EtBr filter than with SYBR gold filter
*** oligo sample is not a single oligo (see lanes 1-4), implying that sensitivity is actually ''greater'' than 1,390 pg (maybe as much as 2x as sensitive)
*** this is good sensitivity, and should be sensitive enough to image digested ligands (assuming that digest yields are greater than about 100 fmols, which corresponds to about 30% yield)
*** this is better sensitivity than EtBr, which can image 1 ng (1,000 pg) of dsDNA, but doesn't stain ssDNA as well

==More Ordering: v4.0 Attachment-Oligos, Oligo-ligand==

[[Media: V4_attch_oligs_olig_ligand_form_TC.xls|v4.0 attachment-oligos and oligo-ligand order form, in tubes]]

* Ordered tubes of v4.0 attachment-oligos and a tube of oligo-ligand.
* Because the IDT order rejected the oligos that were 14nt long, those oligos were re-split in a different way so that they would be longer.  This means that the two liganded-oligos for each of these original oligos (v4.0.6.3 and v4.0.6.4) are NOT to be used from this order.  A second order was placed for these two oligos:

<pre>
c4.0.6.3oa2
GCAAGGCCGGAAACGTCACCACGGCATT

c4.0.6.3ob2
TTCGGTCAGCCGCC TTTTTTTT CCGCGGGCGCGCCCC

c4.0.6.4oa2
TCCAAGAACGGGTATTAAACCAAGCCGT

c4.0.6.4ob2
TTTTATTTGCTATT TTTTTTTT CCGCGGGCGCGCCCC
</pre>

Thus, '''DO NOT USE v4.0.6.3ob or v4.0.6.4ob'''!  Wait until v4.0.6.3oa2, v4.0.6.3ob2, v4.0.6.4oa2, v4.0.6.4ob2 come in!

==AscI digestion protocol proposal==

====Initial test, just oligos====

Start by trying to digest ~25 ng DNA.

1 unit = enough enzyme to digest 1 {{ug}} DNA at 37{{c}} in 1 h in a total reaction volume of 50 {{ul}} [http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/productR0558.asp]
* = enough enzyme to digest 5 {{ug}} DNA at 37{{c}} in 1 h in a total reaction volume of 10 {{ul}}
* = enough enzyme to digest 1 {{ug}} DNA at 37{{c}} in 12 min. in a total reaction volume of 10 {{ul}}

Mix together:
* 998 fmols (14.0 ng) ligand DNA (MW = 14,027 Da [http://www.changbioscience.com/genetics/mw.html]) = 1 {{ul}} 1 {{um}}
* 1 pmol (? ng) attachment DNA (MW = ?) = 1 {{ul}} 1 {{um}}
* 2 {{ul}} 10x BSA
* 2 {{ul}} 10x NEBuffer 4 [http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/productR0558.asp]
* 25 ng DNA should require 0.025 units (25 milliunits) for a 12-minute digest. Do the following trials:
** no enzyme, 12-minute digest
** no enzyme, 24-minute digest
** 50 milliunits (1 {{ul}} 50 milliunits/{{ul}}), 12-minute digest
** 500 milliunits (1 {{ul}} 500 milliunits/{{ul}}), 12-minute digest
** 50 milliunits (1 {{ul}} 50 milliunits/{{ul}}), 24-minute digest
** 500 milliunits (1 {{ul}} 500 milliunits/{{ul}}), 24-minute digest
* water to 20 {{ul}}

Incubate samples at 37{{c}} for specified time. Run on an 18% PA gel.

====Test with nanostructures====
Incubation step:
* incubate unpurified nanostructrures with 10x excess ligand DNA
* purify nanostructures

Digest step:
* 100 fmols (~450 ng) purified, ligand-incubated nanostructures (MW ~= 4,500,000 Da) = 10 {{ul}} 10 nM
* add 2 {{ul}} 10x BSA, 2 {{ul}} 10x NEBuffer 4, 2 {{ul}} of the appropriate AscI dilution as above (perhaps adjust concentrations based on initial results), and water to 20 {{ul}}
* run the same 6 trials as in the initial test (two without enzyme are negative controls)
* also run positive controls (which will verify that digest is working, as well as act as a sort of ladder)
** ligand DNA and attachment DNA
** ligand DNA and attachment DNA + BSA + buffer + AscI (amount determined by initial tests)

Incubate all trials at 37{{c}} for appropriate time.
