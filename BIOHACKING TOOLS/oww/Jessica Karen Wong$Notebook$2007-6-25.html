==To Do==
* If primers are in PCR I2055 and redo's of T9002 and E0240
* Transform ligations of R-J-AT3, R-J-AC3, B-J-AT3, B-J-AC3
* Miniprep and Digest Backbone
* Make Glycerol stocks of Backbone

==Glycerol==
Made glycerols of P1010 1AK3, P1010 1AC3, P1010 1AT3, and P1010 3K3
*Added 1ml overnight culture to 1ml 40% glycerol
*Not sure of the strain, most likely mg1655
*May need to remake 3K3 b/c concentration was too low

==Miniprep==
*First pelleted the DNA - 1.5ml of culture per eppendorf, 3 total per strain
*Spin at 5k for 5 min then remove supernatant and then combine
*Then follow protocol in Qiaprep miniprep handbook using 30ul to elute the DNA

==Transformation==
*See [[Transforming chemically competent cells|protocol]]
*Transformed RFP RBS Tester (blue) and RFP Promoter Tester (green) with mg1655
*Plated each on both Tet and Chlor plates

==Digest==
*Digested backbones with E and P
*Concentrations of the plasmids:
**1AC3 214.8 ng/ul used 5ul
**1AK3 235.7 used 5ul
**1AT3 232.4 used 5ul
*Ran overnight

3K3 had a very low concentration, we minipreped the rest of the culture that we used to make the glycerols but was still low
Made a new overnight of 3K3

==PCR==
*Did a 100ul preparatory PCR of I2055
*Primer dilution: I0255F 34.19nmol added 855ul of water to get 40uM, I2055R 18.19 nmol added 455ul
*Ran overnight
