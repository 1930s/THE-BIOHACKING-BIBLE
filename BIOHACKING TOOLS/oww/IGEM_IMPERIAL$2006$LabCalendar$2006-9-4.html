 <u>'''TO DO:'''</u>
 *Testing of T9002, J37016, J37020, S01656, J37015, J37015RS
 *Culture J37036 & J37018 from plate in incubator for maxi & mini on Tuesday
 *Make frozen stock of J37022 & culture up for testing ! 
 *Send J37024 for sequencing !!!
 *Order new maxiprep kit !!!
 *Need more autoclaved flasks !!!
 *Need more isopropanol too!
 </font color>

==Ligations==
*J04500 (vector) and J37024 (insert)being ligated overnight

==LoxP PCR==

*Was done for the smaller fragment
*Success to be determined tomorrow

==Western Blot==

*3 colonies of Rosetta and 3 colonies of BL21 containing S01656 were cultured up.
*The samples were recultured for a couple of hours to bring them back to an exponential growth phase
*The samples were pipetted into 2 sets of Eppendorfs, one of which was induced with IPTG
*The Western blot was run, and the gel was left to stain
*The results will be known tomorrow morning

==Maxiprep==
*Maxiprep new AiiA gene from overnight culture.
*Not very much bacteria (hence DNA) present.

==AiiA PCR==
*Using the new primers and the newly arrived AiiA gene (maxi-preped this morning), PCR carried oput to add the LVA tag and immunotag.
*PCR annealing temperatures calculated to be 10 cyles at 51{{c}} and 20 cycles at 69{{C}}

==Culturing==
*S01656 +IPTG, S01656 -IPTG, J37016 was cultured for testing
*J37036 & J37018 & T9002 could not be cultured since no colonies could be seen on the plate - they have to grow overnight

==Frozen Cells==
*Made a frozen stock of cells: J37025 (3 different colonies, but all of them have been verified to be correct)
