Hi, my name is Stacy. I am a senior with a year and half to go before I graduate with a double major in Biology and Anthropology. After graduation I will take a year to work, and think about going to graduate school. After school, I hope to work in the police department, possibly in the FBI or crime lab. I haven't decided exactly what to do, but I know that I want to be a detective and find the bad guys.
