=Plan Construction=
As an example we will be building:
#<bbpart>J04500</bbpart>+<bbpart>I13501</bbpart> = <bbpart>J04450</bbpart> (RFP expression device)
#*Promoter/RBS + FP

Possibly try this later:
#<bbpart>R0010</bbpart>+<bbpart>I13504</bbpart> = <bbpart>J04430</bbpart> (GFP expression device)
#*Promoter + RBS/FP

=Primer Design=
==External Primers==
#Design 20bp primers from the ends of the finished assembly.
#Add 15bp overhangs based on digesting 1AK3 with E/P using this [http://bioinfo.clontech.com/infusion/convertPcrPrimersInit.do primer design tool for primers for the In-Fusion cloning method]

===PCR conditions===
*Used the same conditions for J04500 and I13501
#Initial Denaturation – 98C for 30s
#Denaturation – 98C for 5s
#Annealing – 65C for 15s @ Tm+3C 
#Extension – 72C 13s
#repeat to (2) 20 times.
#Final extension – 72C for 5-10min
#4C indef

==PCR Reaction B==
*Going to try this 2 ways:
*#Dilute the PCR produces of PCR A 1/1000 (add 1uL of each as the template) and then add them together with external primers
*#Do extension with no primers and add the undiluted PCRA as primers (e.g. 5uL of each one with no template added).
