#**Digital camera, batteries charged
===INSTRUCTIONS===
#At least a week before the class begins: streak out the following strains
#**NY290 on –trp
#**NY291 on –trp
#Two days before lab: set up the following as 2x 2.5mL SC-trp at 30∞
#**NY290= pCT-CON in “DY” = EBY100
#**NY291= pAu1 in “DY” = EBY100
#The day before lab:  set up 50mL in RT shaker, inoculating 1.25mL into each
#**NY290 in CAA(Gal)
#**NY291 in CAA (Gal)
#To grow the library go directly from the frozen stock of NY286 and inoculate 5mL of CAA(Gal) for each group, plus one or two extra in case someone drops a tube. Use a good size inoculum.

==Module 4 Day 3==
#Need quiz
#Student Benchtop:
#**Four cultures, 5mL of each, induced from library screen
#**Two cultures, 5mL of each, for each group
#**Overnight of NY290 (pCT-CON in “DY”)
#**Overnight of NY291 (pAu1 in “DY”)

#**-trp plates (6/group = 36 at least)
#**Gold slides cut into 6mm x 10mm (6 pieces/group = 36 pieces at least)
#**Digital camera, batteries charged
===INSTRUCTIONS===
#One day before lab:  induce each student culture by moving 125uL into the corresponding 5mL of CAA(Gal).  Also induce 50mL of CAA(Gal) with 1.25mL controls.  Grow RT O/N.


==Module 4 Day 4==
#Need quiz
#Student Benchtop:
#**Ice buckets with ice
#**Toothpicks
#**Sterile water
#Instructor Bechtop:
#**Ice bucket with PCR master mix, PCR primers (called NO52 and NO53), positive control DNA
#**For sequencing, you want each tube to have 2uL of 1:10 dilution of PCR product, 6.4uL of 1:100 seq primer (called NO50) and 15.6uL water.  Can mix the last two as a cocktail and aliquot 22uL / seq tube.
===INSTRUCTIONS===
#This lab time will be straightforward, with just PCR, and then running samples to the biopolymer facility (E17-415) and thankfully there are no cultures to prepare in advance.
#PCR program “called something like 52/35”
#*94∞4’
#*94∞1’
#*52∞1
#*72∞2’ 35x
#*72∞10’
#*4∞ hold

==Module 4 Day 5==
Student presentations

==Module 4 Day 6==
#Need quiz
#The set-up for this lab is nothing.  Just confirm that the laptops are all working and have the appropriate programs to retrieve sequence data from the Biopolymer’s facility.
#For the PCs, this would mean FileZila to retrieve sequences
#Chromas http://www.technelysium.com.au/chromas.html to view traces
#Excel to view sequence
#IE or Netscape to analyze it
