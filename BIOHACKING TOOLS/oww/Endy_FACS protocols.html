==Protocol==
Here is a [[Synthetic Biology:BioBricks/Standard FACS protocol|basic standard protocol]] that we try and use in the Endy and Knight labs.  Exact conditions may depend on the strain, induction conditions etc.

==Equipment==
When we are doing flow experiments, we normally use a FACScan cytometer, described [http://web.mit.edu/flowcytometry/www/equipment.html here].  Some lab members have experience using the MoFlo machines also.  We also have an [[Endy:NPE_flow_cytometer|NPE flow cytometer]] that we use in our lab for some experiments.

==Media==
As described in the standard protocol we often use [[M9_medium/supplemented|Supplemented M9 media]] although we are now switching to using [[Neidhardt_EZ_Rich_Defined|EZ media]] where possible.

==Bead calibration==
We calibrate results from day to day using this [[Flow_Calibration|bead protocol]].

==Data analysis==
We do all our analysis using [http://www.flowjo.com/ FlowJo] and [http://mathworks.com Matlab].
