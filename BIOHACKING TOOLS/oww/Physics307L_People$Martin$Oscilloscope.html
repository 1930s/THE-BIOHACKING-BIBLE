3. Report your value for the fall time using AC coupling.

My value for the fall time was 53 ms with a std deviation of 0.8

* Explain how you measured this (briefly) 
we measured this by selecting the fall time feature on the oscilloscope.

4. What did you learn?

I have never used an oscilloscope before so I got the chance to learn how to use one.  I also learned alot about how to edit the wiki site and move around on it easier.

5. What did you explore outside of the standard lab procedure?  Anything interesting?

I tired to adjust the settings to get a standing wave on my display screen but other then that I stuck to the planned out lab.

6. What could make the lab better next year?

I think that there are places that the instructions could be a little more clear.  Plus is would be nice to have the expected value for the RC constant already found so we could compare our result.
