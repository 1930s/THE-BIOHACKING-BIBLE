[[Image:Kondo_img.jpg|thumb|Circadian organization (Kondo et al 2004).]]
*gene cluster KaiABC involved
*'''no homology to eukarayotic circadian systems'''
*Central oscillator controls output patterns; phase of oscillator controlled by input
*Photosynthesis by day, nitrogen fixation by night (2 incompatible in unicellular)
*Used luciferase DNA expressed downstream as a reporter
*Genome 2.7kb in size (e. coli 6.1kb)
*Put luxAB on a psbA plasmid, luxAB luciferase related protein  volatile
**See diagram in paper for circuitry
*KaiABC system
**Overexpression of KaiC represses KaiA and KaiB
**Overexpression of KaiA activates KaiBC
**KaiC center of oscillation
*Question TBA: why 24h period?
**Single point mutations in KaiC can change period from 14h to 60h
*Drosophila and Neurospora also have clock models
*Cyanobacteria has no nuclear envelope, can divide 6h/time
*KaiABC analogues only found on archaeobacteria

===Kucho et al.===
*Purpose of regulation to prepare cell for night in cyanobacteria
*Tested Synechocystis, which is a different strain of cyanobacteria
*77% in Synechocystis rhymic clones; 100% in Synechococcus
*In cyanobacteria
**KaiC regulated by negative feedback autoreg. loop
**KaiA activates kaiBC
*Used DNA microarray to determine mRNA cyclic nature
*cycling genes detected; peak expression from day to night
**Genes mostly:
***unassigned
***carbohydrate metabolism
***energy metabolism purposes
***transcription!
***translation!
*2 Sigma factors have circadian rhythm: sll1689, sll0687 on RNAPol
