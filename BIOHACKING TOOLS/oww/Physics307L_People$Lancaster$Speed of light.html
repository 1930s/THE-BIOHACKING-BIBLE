*This lab was about measuring the speed of light.  
*The method was fairly straight forward, use the change in distance as measured by the ruler vs. the change in time using a photomultiplier tube and a TAC.
*The last semester lab procedure and materials list explains things very well [http://www-hep.phys.unm.edu/~gold/phys307L/ Previous Course]
, with a very good graph of how time walk effects the electronics.
