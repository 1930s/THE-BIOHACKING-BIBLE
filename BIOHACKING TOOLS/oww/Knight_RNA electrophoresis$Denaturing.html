==Overview==

Electrophoresis permits assessment of RNA by size and amount.  In general, electrophoresis of RNA is done as a step prior to Northern analysis.  However, this protocol is for visualizing the RNA in the gel.  Since this is a denaturing protocol, the RNA can be assessed both for quality and size.

==Materials==
===Reagents===
*RNAse free water (make lots for rinsing glassware and electrophoresis chambers)
**Add DEPC to final concentration of 0.1%.
**Incubate 1hr at 37&deg;C.
**Autoclave for 15 mins at 15 psi.
*[[10X BPTE electrophoresis buffer]] (The final pH of this 10x buffer is ~6.5.)
**100 mM PIPES
**300 mM Bis-Tris
**10 mM EDTA
*HPLC grade or better DMSO
*Glyoxal
**Commercially available stock solutions of glyoxal contain both hydrated forms of glyoxal and oxidation products that can degrade RNA.  These must be removed.
*Glyoxal reaction mixture (divide into small aliquots and store at -70&deg;C)
**6mL DMSO
**2mL deionized glyoxal
**1.2mL of 10X BPTE electrophoresis buffer
**0.6mL of 80% glycerol
*RNA size marker
*RNA gel loading buffer
**95% deionized formamide
***Purchase a distilled deionized preparation of formamide and store in small aliquots under nitrogen at -20°C.
**0.025% (w/v) bromophenol blue
**0.025% (w/v) xylene cyanol FF
**5 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)
**0.025% (w/v) SDS

===Equipment===

*55 &deg;C water bath
*Ice water bath
*Electrophoresis apparatus

==Procedure==
===Prepare RNase free water===
#Add DEPC to final concentration of 0.1% to H<sub>2</sub>O
#Incubate 1hr at 37&deg;C.
#Autoclave for 15 mins at 15 psi.

===Prepare BPTE electrophoresis buffer===
#Prepare 10X buffer by adding the following to 90 ml of distilled H<sub>2</sub>O
#*3 g of PIPES (free acid)
#*6 g of Bis-Tris (free base)
#*2 ml of 0.5 M EDTA 
#Treat the solution with final concentration of 0.1% DEPC for 1 hour at 37°C
#Autoclave.

Dilute 10X buffer 10-fold with RNase free H<sub>2</sub>O.

===Prepare glyoxal reaction mixture===
#6mL DMSO
#2mL deionized glyoxal
#1.2mL of 10X BPTE electrophoresis buffer
#0.6mL of 80% glycerol

Divide into small aliquots and store at -70&deg;C.

===Prepare RNA gel loading buffer===
#Mix the following
#*95% deionized formamide
#**Purchase a distilled deionized preparation of formamide and store in small aliquots under nitrogen at -20°C.
#*0.025% (w/v) bromophenol blue
#*0.025% (w/v) xylene cyanol FF
#*5 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)
#*0.025% (w/v) SDS

===Denature RNA samples===
#Mix 10 &mu;L glyoxal reaction mixture with 1-2 &mu;L RNA (up to 10 &mu;g).
#Also mix 10 &mu;L glyoxal reaction mixture with RNA size marker.
#Incubate RNA samples at 55&deg;C for 1 hr.
#Chill RNA samples for 10 mins in ice water.
#Centrifuge 5 seconds to collect liquid at the bottom of the tubes.

===Cast gel===
Do this step during 1 hr denaturation of samples.

#Cast 1.5% agarose gel in 1X BPTE electrophoresis buffer.
#Use a comb with at least 4 extra lanes for size markers and running dyes.
#Place gel in chamber.
#Cover with 1X BPTE electrophoresis buffer to cover gel to a depth of 1mm.

===Run gel===
#Add 1-2&mu;L RNA gel loading buffer to glyoxylated RNA samples
#Immediately load samples.  Leave two outside lanes on each side empty.
#Load RNA size markers on outside lanes of gel.
#Electrophorese at 5V/cm.

===Stain gel===
#Prepare fresh 1:10,000 dilution in RNase free water of SYBR gold.
#Ensure pH is 7.0-8.5.
#Pour into staining tray.
#Place gel in plastic staining container.
#Shield from light.
#Agitate gently for 10-40 mins at room temperature.
#Image with [[Knight:Gel imager]].  (Place a clear ruler next to gel to more accurately assess length.)
