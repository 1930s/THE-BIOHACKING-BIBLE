==Optimizing Conditions==
;Purpose: To find conditions that may yield better gold-binding colonies.

'''Conditions'''
*30C
*Room Temp
*4C

'''Protocol'''
#Place a 6 mm x 10 mm slide into the top three wells of a six well dish, shiny-side up.
#Add 2 ml Gal Blocking/Binding Buffer to cover the gold slides.
#Place the dish on the rocking shaker set at speed 7 and let it rock there for at least 10 minutes at each temperature.
#The teaching faculty provided 5ml aliquots of each yeast group. Harvest the cells by spinning the tubes in the centrifuge 2000 RPM, 5 minutes.
#Aspirate the media from the cells. You do not have to remove every drop. In fact it’s better to leave a small amount of liquid on the cells rather than risk aspirating away the cells themselves.
#Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of the Gal Blocking/Binding Buffer
#Aspirate the Blocking/Binding Buffer from each of the gold slides and pipet 1.5 ml of fresh Gal Blocking/Binding Buffer.
#Add 1 ml of the cells that you have resuspended into the appropriate well.
#Place the dish on the rocking shaker set at speed 7 for 30 minutes at each temperature.
#After panning for 30 minutes, move the gold slides to the bottom three wells of the six well dish with 2 ml fresh Gal Blocking/Binding Buffer. Use forceps to move the slides, touching only the edges, and wipe the forceps with ethanol between each sample.
#Place the dish on the rocking shaker set at speed 7 for 15 minutes at each temperature.
#Label three Petri dishes that have –trp media. They should be labeled with the name of the sample as well as the date and your initials.
#Use forceps to move the slides one last time into a new six well dish with 2 ml fresh Gal Blocking/Binding Buffer.
#Photograph the surface of the gold slides using the digital camera and the WILD® light microscope.
#Move the gold slides to eppendorf tubes that have 500 &mu;l of sterile water. Vortex each for 30 seconds exactly. Plate 100 &mu;l on –trp Petri dishes. Once all your plates have dried, wrap them with your colored tape and place them in the 30&deg;C incubator, media side up.
#You can aspirate any remaining liquid from the 6 well dishes and discard them into the biohaz waste. The eppendorf tubes with your yeast and gold slides can be directly discarded into the biohazardous waste.

==Preparing Overnights==
;Purpose: To grow up binding colonies so that we can compare them later.

'''Protocol'''
#Put 2.5 ml Glucose media in 4 tubes labeled A, B, C, & D.
#Put 5 ml Galactose media in 4 tubes labeled A, B, C, & D.
#Pick 4 colonies from the library plate (label them on the plate) and use a sterile dowel to move some of the colonies to it appropriate Glucose tube.
#Put the glucose tube in the rotor and give the galactose tubes to the faculty.

==Summary==
Today was a preparation for Friday.  We picked colonies that will be ready by then, and also tried new protocols to make the screening process better.
