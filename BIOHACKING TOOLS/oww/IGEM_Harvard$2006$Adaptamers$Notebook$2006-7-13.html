For now, we will 

1) debug SDS-PAGE with the nanos.
2) Search for possible cell surface protein targets for which aptamers have been developed (and have published sequences).

We heard back from the group that had created Lipopolysaccharide aptamers (that cand bind the E. coli cell surface). The group only created a polyclonal batch and never got specific aptamers sequenced before funding was cut. Unfortunate.

Nanos have gotten protein to show up on a gel; they ran it for 15 minutes at 120 V.
