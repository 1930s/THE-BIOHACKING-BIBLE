We're awesome.

*Summary
**Efflux pump has 3 components: outer membrane(OM), inner membrane(IM), periplasmic protein
**Periplasmic components of these pumps are proposed to move the membranes close together
**Efflux pumps for small molecules and proteins function by different mechanisms
*Drug Efflux in E. Coli
**Periplasmic component: AcrA
**IM: AcrB
**OM: TolC
**AcrAB emoves substrates from cell directly into medium
**TolC proposed to also associate with other several other transport systems
**AcrB is part of the RND superfamily
**AcrA is part of the Membrane Fusion Protein 
**OM seem to be interchangeable between different systems
*Membrane Fusion Protein
**2 hydrophobic domains near N/C termini and interact with the IM and OM
**AcrA also has covalently-linked lipids at N-terminal
**AcrA = 20nm, highly asymmetric, has alpha-helical region centrally located
**MFP proposed to work by bringingg the Im and OM together

*Summary
**There is evidence for the physical interactions between the TolC (outer membrane component) and AcrA (Periplasmic protein) of the drug efflux system in E. Coli
**TolC and AcrAB must make direct contact to carry out efflux function
**TolC-AcrA complexes exist in cell independent of AcrB
**AcrB not needed for AcrA to physically interact with TolC
**Possible for TolC-AcrA, AcrA-AcrB or TolC-AcrAB complexes to form spontaneously
