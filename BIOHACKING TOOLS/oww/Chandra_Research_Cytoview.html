The biological cell, a natural self-contained unit of prime biological importance, is an enormously complex machine
that can be understood at many levels. A higher-level perspective of the entire cell requires integration of various
features into coherent, biologically meaningful descriptions. There are some efforts to model cells based on their
genome, proteome or metabolome descriptions. However, there are no established methods as yet to describe cell
morphologies, capture similarities and differences between different cells or between healthy and disease states.
We are developing a framework to model various aspects of a cell and integrate knowledge encoded at different levels
of abstraction, with cell morphologies at one end to atomic structures at the other. The different issues that have been
addressed are ontologies, feature description and model building. The framework describes dotted representations
and tree data structures to integrate diverse pieces of data and parametric models enabling size, shape and location
descriptions. The framework serves as a first step in integrating different levels of data available for a biological
cell and has the potential to lead to development of computational models in our pursuit to model cell structure and
function, from which several applications can flow out.
