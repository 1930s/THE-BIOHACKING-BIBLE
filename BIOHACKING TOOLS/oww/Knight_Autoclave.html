We now have two identical autoclaves in [http://www.csail.mit.edu/resources/maps/3/322.gif 32-322].  One is used exclusively for sterilizing biozardous waste and the other is for sterilizing clean glassware and media for use in experiments.  They are labelled as such.

See [[Knight:Biohazardous_waste | instructions for sterilizing biohazardous waste]].  It also contains instructions for autoclave validation.
