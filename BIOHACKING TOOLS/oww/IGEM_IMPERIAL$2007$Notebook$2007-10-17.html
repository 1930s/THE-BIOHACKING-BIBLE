==Temperature step test for pTet-GFPmut3b==
*The '''aim''' of this test was to determine the response of the pTet-GFPmut3b construct to a step change in temperature.
*For complete materials and methods see the [[Imperial/Wet_Lab/Protocols/CBD2.3|Protocol]]  
*The construct was tested at two temperature steps:
*#From 4&deg;C (for 3 hours) to 20&deg;C (3 hours)
*#From 20&deg;C (for 3 hours) to 4&deg;C (3 hours)
*The sampling time was every hour
*The [[Imperial/Wet_Lab/Results/CBD2.3|Results]] show that the step changes in temperature affect the fluorescence produced by the pTet-GFPmut3b construct
