==Introduction==
Standardization of components and processes has led to major advances in mature engineering disciplines.  From screw threads to British Standards to unit operations, engineering has benefited from doing things in a standard way.  The engineering of biological systems will also benefit from the development and implementation of standard components and practices.  This page is intended to aggregate some of the different standards that the Synthetic Biology Working Group is trying to develop.

There have been some initial attempts to brainstorm what form those standards might take.  It is likely that we will need several classes of standards and that each class of standards which have different versions to meet different needs.  

==Standards of practice==

*'''Design''': the way(s) in which systems are designed from BioBrick parts.
**See [http://parts.mit.edu Registry of Standard Biological Parts] for standard biological parts.
**See [[Synthetic Biology:Abstraction hierarchy | Standard abstraction framework for engineered biological systems]] for a discussion on how cope with the design of increasingly complex biological systems.

*'''Fabrication''': the way(s) in which BioBricks are physically constructed and assembled together.
**See [[Synthetic Biology:BioBricks/Part fabrication | Part fabrication]] for information on construction of new biological parts.
**See [[BioBricks construction tutorial]], [[Synthetic Biology:BioBricks/3A assembly | 3A assembly]] or [[Silver: BB Strategy | Silver lab assembly strategy]] for information on assembly of existing biological parts.
**See [[Synthetic Biology:Vectors | Vectors]] for information on the vectors in which BioBricks reside.

*'''Documentation''': the way(s) in which BioBricks are documented.
**See [[Barcodes]] for information on signing BioBricks parts.
**See [[Endy:F2620 | Device datasheet example]] for a working example of documenting a BioBrick.
**See [[Synthetic Biology:Semantic web ontology | Semantic web ontology]] for an ontology for biological parts.

*'''Characterization''': the way(s) in which the behavior of BioBricks are measured.
**See [[Parts characterization | Standard methods for part characterization]] for some preliminary notes on parts characterization.
**See [[Standardized GFP quantification]] for notes on making absolute molecule number measurements.

*'''Operation''': the conditions under which systems from BioBricks are operated.
**See [[Synthetic Biology:Vectors | Standard vectors]] for information on the vectors in which BioBricks reside.
**See [[Standard E. coli Strain for BioBricks | Standard cellular chassis]] for notes on constructing a novel strain in which all BioBricks would operate.
**See [[Synthetic Biology:Media | Standard culture media]] for information on a culture media in which all constructs would operate.
