This page contains links to introductory information for the MIT iGEM team.

==Design==
===System Design considerations===
*Feasible system scale (numbers of parts, plasmids, chassis types)
*Design tools - models, network diagrams
*Moving from system->devices->parts->DNA specification
*Likelihood of success - protein engineering, cloning, new biological techniques and new science etc.

===Abstraction hierarchy & standardization===
*Parts - zinc fingers?
*Devices - receiver?, inverter?
*Systems - bacterial photography?
*PoPS and composability

==Build==
===Construction methods===
*[[BioBricks]] <font color=red>- Day 1, Week 1</font>
*Standard assembly <font color=blue>- Day 2, Week 1</font>
*3A assembly
*In frame assembly
*Direct synthesis

===Construction tools===
*Registry
*#Obtain accounts <font color=red>- Day 1, Week 1</font>
*#Making a part (both basic and composite) <font color=red>- Day 1, Week 1</font>
*#BLAST
*#Sequence alignments
*NCBI Entrez  <font color=red>- Day 1, Week 1</font>
*VectorNTI
*Others?

==Test==
*Plate reader characterization (i.e. Receiver)
*Flow cytometry (i.e. Screening plasmid)
*Microscopy
*RT-PCR and Westerns

==Necessary skills==
===Lab notebooks & documentation===
*[[OpenWetWare:Getting started | Getting started with wiki editing]] <font color=red>- Day 1, Week 1</font>
*Populate the [http://parts.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/MIT_2006 official MIT iGEM 2006 wiki page]
*The online lab notebook framework

===Searching and reading the literature===
*[[Searching the literature]] <font color=green>- Day 3, Week 1</font>

===Lab safety===
*Complete the [[Endy:Safety_Training | '''Endy lab safety training''']].  (Even if you have worked in a lab before, you should visit this page and verify that your training is up to date.)  This should be done before your first day in lab.
*Heather will be giving the lab-specific training <font color=red>- Day 1, Week 1</font>
