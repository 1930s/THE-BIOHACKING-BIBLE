|width="50px"| 
|width="400px"| Upon induction, the pTet-LuxR-pLux-GFP construct showed a significant fluorescent signal when compared to the negative control. In addition, the fluorescence levels were comparable to that of the positive control, indicating strong expression of GFP with the construct.

'''Controls:'''
*Positive control - diluted GFP solution of equal volume
*Negative control - LB media of equal volume

==Discussion==
===[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_T9002 '''pTet-LuxR-pLux-GFP''']===
Fig.1 showed that the pTet-LuxR-pLux-GFP construct gave a good amount of expression of GFP (~83000), indicating that the construct is functioning well ''in vivo''. The drawback of this construct, however, is that LuxR levels within the cells are inconsistent, to which this variation would complicate the kinetics of GFP expression. Thus it will be unfair to relate the increase in expression of fluorescence solely due to the increase in induction and strength of the pLux promoter. 

There was also significant variability in the results across the different samples, which could be attributed either to experimental methodology, or the intrinsic nature of variability of expression in the ''in vivo'' chassis.


==Conclusion==
To conclude,
* pTet-LuxR-pLux-GFP construct gave a strong fluorescent signal, indicating good expression of GFP ''in vivo''.
* LuxR levels are inconsistent throughout experiment.
* Significant variability was found in all ''in vivo'' fluorometer experiments.
