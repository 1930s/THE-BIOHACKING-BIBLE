==Automatic colony counter==
Does anybody have access (or know about access to) an automatic colony counter? I'm looking for a way to count colonies of different colors. Please email kemd@mit.edu with any information. Thanks.

*'''[[User:Rshetty|Reshma]] 11:45, 11 December 2006 (EST)''': You could try emailing the [[Biostuff@mit.edu|biostuff list]] to reach a wider MIT-specific audience.  You may also be able to do something by just taking a photo of your plate and do some sort of image analysis to count colonies.  I've never done this but it shouldn't be that different from what people do to identify cells from microscope images.  Though that might be an overly complex solution to your problem.  Not sure.

==Vector LoxP sites flanking two antibiotic marker genes for use in E.coli==
I am in need of a low-copy vector (1 to 2 per cell) which carries two antibiotic marker genes. (preferably one sensitive such rpsL, and 
one resistant such at Tetracycline, Chloramphenicol, etc.) and are FLANKED between two LoxP sites so as once i express Cre recombinase i get recombination between the lox sites and removal of the antibiotic sites. I have rpsL gene at the lab, also i have tetracycline. So even if the plasmid doesn';t carry any antibiotic genes, but has LoxP it would be o.k and i may move in with my construct by subcloning between the sites but that would entail more work... :)
Anyone in a position to help? I would also be very happy,whoever wishes,to collaborate and explain better my underlying project.

*'''[[User:Rshetty|Reshma]] 08:56, 7 September 2006 (EDT)''': See [[Bacterial artificial chromosomes]] for some options.  Some of the BACs listed there have loxP sites.  But you have to be careful about [[F plasmids| which one you use to really get copy number 1-2]].

==RBS prediction==
Is there an online or otherwise easy to use tool for finding RBS sites?
===Reply===
I've used [http://www.tigr.org/software/genefinding.shtml TIGR's software] to do RBS prediction.  The program is called RBS finder. Also, if you have a specific sequence you want to test, you can use Stormo's work:

Of couse, this is all for ''E. coli''

==Homologous recombination in ''E. coli''==

If anyone has experience with homologous recombination in ''E. coli'' please check out the [[Standard E. coli Strain for BioBricks]] project and annotate the page with your feedback and comments.  Please include any [[Protocols | protocols]] or [[Materials | materials]] information you might have on the appropriate pages and link to them from the [[Standard E. coli Strain for BioBricks| standard strain project page]] as well.  Any and all advice is appreciated.

See [[Standard E. coli Strain for BioBricks]] for comments. Can add more detail later.--[[User:Kathmc|Kathleen]]
