T4 DNA ligase is often used for [[DNA ligation]].

==Notes==
* T4 DNA ligase is very sensitive to salt concentration. Greater than 70mM NaCl can begin to have inhibitory effect and 200mM NaCl can completely inactivate the enzyme. Even though NEB says you can use the ligase in all NEBuffers, NEB3 contains 100mM NaCl and has been found to not work too well. --[[User:Austin J. Che|Austin Che]] 17:03, 17 September 2007 (EDT)
