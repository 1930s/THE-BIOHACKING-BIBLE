* 0.6mL PCR tubes

==Procedure==
#Thaw sample buffer (red cap) and reaction buffer (blue cap) on ice.
#Transfer 5 &mu;L of sample buffer to small PCR tube for each template to be amplified.
#Add template to sample buffer
#*Dilute 1&mu;L  saturated overnight culture in 10-100 &mu;L water.  Use 0.2-0.5 &mu;L.
#*Use small portion of a colony.  Avoid transferring any agar.
#*Dilute 1&mu;L glycerol stock in 50&mu;L water.  Use 0.2-0.5 &mu;L.
#*Use 1pg-10ng of purified plasmid DNA (volume < 0.5&mu;L)
#Heat sample to 95&deg;C for 3 mins to denature and cool to 4&deg;C.
#Mix 5 &mu;L reaction buffer with 0.2&mu;L enzyme mix for each reaction.  (Make up a master mix for multiple reactions.)
#Transfer 5 &mu;L TempliPhi premix to cooled sample.
#Incubate at 30&deg;C for 4-18 hours.
#*Incubate overnight for optimal results but 4 hours should be sufficient if there is not too much inhibitory material like agar or rich medium.
#Heat to 65&deg;C for 10 mins.
#Cool to 4 &deg;C.
#Send DNA for [[Knight:Sequencing DNA|sequencing]]. 
#* Use 2&mu;L in 12&mu;L for sequencing at the biopolymers facility
#* Previously, for sequencing on the Knight lab sequencer, we used 1&mu;L
