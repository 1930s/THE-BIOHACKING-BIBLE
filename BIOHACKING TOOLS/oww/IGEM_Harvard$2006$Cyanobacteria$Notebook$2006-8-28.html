* 8ul Midiprep KaiA DNA + 1 ul S+P enzyme + 2.5ul 10x Buffer #2 + 2.5ul 10x BSA + 10ul H2O-> 45C 6H
* 8ul Midiprep KaiB DNA + 1 ul X+P enzyme + 2.5ul 10x Buffer #2 + 2.5ul 10x BSA + 10ul H2O-> 45C 6H

==Digestion of KaiC /XP ==

==Digestion of BioBrick vector==

Each KaiC:
#*4 uL DNA (42)
#*1 µL 10 x BSA (10.5)
#*1 µL 10x buffer #3 (10.5)
#*0.2 µL Xba1 (2.1)
#*0.2 µL Pst1 (2.1)
#*3.6 uL H20 (37.8)

# 10 samples
# Incubate for 4h@45

Each J04500:
#*4 uL DNA (22.4)
#*1 µL 10 x BSA (6.5)
#*1 µL 10x buffer #2 (6.5)
#*0.2 µL Spe1 (1.3)
#*0.2 µL Pst1 (1.3)
#*3.6 uL H20 (23.4)

#6 samples
#Incubate for 4h@45

Then CIP treated J04500 w/ 1uL CIP for 1h

==Running KaiC and J04500 on gel==

This was the fun part; ran 10 KaiC and 6 J04500 on gel, but DID NOT use ETBR (found a paper which said it can reduce by 90% ligation efficiency when DNA w/ETBR exposed for 1min, and it interlocates which kills ligation efficiency). Used a "marker lane," ran gel, cut out the "marker lane" and post-stained in TBE+EtBr, UV imaged the marker lane and cut out band location, then matched it to the non-stained gel and cut corresponding area. Done for both; see below images.

==Gel Purification AND PCR purification of KaiC and J04500==
Did a gel purification of KaiC and J04500. Most importantly:<br>
1) Definately do the extra QG wash<br>
2) Let the DNA sit in PE for awhile (5min)<br>
3) Did a third spin to get rid of excess PE<br>
4) PreHeated EB to 70C<br>
5) Eluted in 50 of EB<br>

Note that eluting in H20 is uber-bad; the pH can be as low as ph5 out of the millicue. Nick also did experiments showing that 1/3EB + H20 is bad. <br>

The extra PCR purification step was to combine all 6 J04500 and all 10 KaiC into one 30uL concentrated tube; this further cleans the DNA, concentrates it, and allows us to elute in EB (and not use the vacufuge). Got two colored tubes sitting in our freezer (30uL EB)

== Miniprep and sequencing of Nick's 22.8 J04500 + KaiB transformant colonies ==
Last night we grew up 3 cultures inoculated from 3 colonies from Nick's 22.8 ligation (J04500 + KaiB). Colony #3 appeared to contain KaiB according to Nick's colony PCR. We miniprepped the cultures and sent all 3 off for sequencing.
