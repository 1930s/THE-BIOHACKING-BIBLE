==E0240==
*Trying mutagenic PCR of E0240.
*Used 17 cycles. Don't know what # is optimal. Stratagene recommends 12, but people seem to use ~18.
**Too many cycles -> more junk DNA.
*Digesting with [[DpnI]]. Felix suggested digesting for >2h.

==Transformations==
*Later will try re-transforming into another set of competent Top10 cells.
*Should make more MG1655.
*Re-tried yesterday's transformations into Top10s.
*O/n of MG1655 is growing.
