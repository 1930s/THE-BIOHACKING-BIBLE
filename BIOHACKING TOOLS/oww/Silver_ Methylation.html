Protein methylation has been implicated in regulation of cellular processes ranging from growth control to protein sorting. Several years ago, our laboratory discovered and characterized the major arginine methyltransferase of yeast. We now know that there are at least 6 PRMTs in humans. Experiments in the lab are underway to determine the function of arginine methylation in gene expression, RNA metabolism and signaling.
