There are a number of steps to be taken in order to create a program that will achieve the requested functions and I think Xiaodi, Mike and Zach outline those beautifully.  So, instead of repeating those suggestions here, I decided to add to their discussion on Xiaodi's page (http://openwetware.org/wiki/Harvard:Biophysics_101/2007/Notebook:Xiaodi_Wu/2007-3-20).  I think Cynthia and I will try to work on writing code to search through OMIM records (assuming that OMIM has already been stored as an array of entries) to find the relevant material and then try to search through that for the relevant information.  My March 13th code can be used to detect mutations (both in the nucleic acid and amino acid sequence) for comparison of a test sequence against a reference sequence.
