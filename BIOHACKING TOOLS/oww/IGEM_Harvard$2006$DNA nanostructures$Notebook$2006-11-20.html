==Gel Analysis (repeat)==
- samples: c5.0A (no lids, no aptamers), c5.0C (no lids, inside aptamers), c5.0D (no lids, outside aptamers)

- 2.0% agarose gel: 2 g agarose + 100 {{ul}} 0.5x TBE + 1.1 mL 1 M {{mgcl2}} + 5 {{ul}} EtBr

- lanes: 
             1 = ladder (10 {{ul}})
             2 = p7308 scaffold (5 {{ul}} + 3 {{ul}} dye)
             3 = c5.0A (5 {{ul}} + 3 {{ul}} dye)
             4 = c5.0C (5 {{ul}} + 3 {{ul}} dye)
             5 = c5.0D (5 {{ul}} + 3 {{ul}} dye)

- run 1 hr. @ 130 V

- results: the folding did not succeed, as can be seen by the lack of bands in the 3rd through 5th lanes near the position of the scaffold
