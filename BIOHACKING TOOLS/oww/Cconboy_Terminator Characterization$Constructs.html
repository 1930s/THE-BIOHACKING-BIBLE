A series of terminator characterization constructs was built using BioBricks standard assembly. [http://biobricks.ai.mit.edu/Assembly/BB_Assembly.htm] Each construct encodes ECFP and EYFP on a polycistronic message, separated by the transcriptional terminator of interest. The ECFP and EYFP (E0021 and E0031) used in this study were derived from Clonetech expression vectors and include the native ribosome binding site. [http://orders.clontech.com/clontech/techinfo/vectors_dis/pECFP.shtml], [http://orders.clontech.com/clontech/techinfo/vectors_dis/pEYFP.shtml], [https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/21167/1/dist-1-00.pdf] The BioBricked wild-type ''lac'' promoter (R0010) drives expression of the construct. All constructs were built on pSB1A1 in DH5a. (Fig. 1). Characterization constructs were built for six terminators and their reverse counterparts (B0010-B0015 and B0020-B0025).
A control construct lacking an internal terminator (I7003) was used to determine a baseline YFP to CFP fluorescence ratio. Output from this construct was assumed to represent zero percent termination efficiency. Additional constructs expressing ECFP only (I7000) and EYFP only (I7001) from the same promoter served as high-expression controls. (Table 1).
