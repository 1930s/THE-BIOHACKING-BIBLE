*We will ditch M9 and move to EZ.  Also, Professor Tribe said that he used Neidhardt (EZ) or 56 mineral salts to make chorismate overproducers in a quick and dirty fashion.  So, our best bet seems to be EZ media.

=Protein Gel Result=

It looks like we can see the BSMT band, but the band does not have enough definition to say that J45181's BSMT is being expressed in greater quantity than J45120's BSMT.

=Banana Update=

Now, Alex says that it doesn't look like the GC will be available until next week.

=Plate Reader Results=

It looks like the machine screwed up.  Barry is doing an injection test, and then, we will see what happens from there.

=EZ Media Preparation=

Made 500 mL 5X supplement EZ with the proper amount of amino acids in it plus .845 mL thiamine HCl minus calcium pantothenate, p-aminobenzoic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid

''Calculation for thiamine HCl''

Recipe calls for .169 g in 25 mL or 6.76 mg/mL.  Our stock is 10 mg/mL.  Thus, we would add .676 the amount of our stock to the 100X VA Vitamin Solution, which is 25 mL of 500 mL, or a 1:20 dilution.  .676*.05 = .0338.  Then, we would add 50 mL of 100X VA Vitamin solution per 1000 mL 5X, so .0338 *50 mL/5 = .338 mL/200 mL 5X solution.

So, I did J45700, J45800, & MG1655 in EZ media, EZ media - vitamins, EZ media - vitamins - PHE - TYR -TRP in 10 mL cultures with .4 mL fructose added
