''These are some tips for being a good curator for a review.  Please contribute.''
*You can use the [http://openwetware.org/index.php?title=Reviews/Curator/Tips&action=history RSS feed from the history page] to more easily keep up to date with recent changes to the review (the RSS link is at the bottom of the toolbox in the left hand menu).  You can also add it to your [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] by clicking the watch tab at the top of the page.

*For uploading existing papers there is an [[Media:â€ŽBiblio_Refs_for_Wiki.ens|Endnote style]] available for converting the references to be compatible with the [http://www.wikiomics.org/wiki/Biblio Biblio] extension. Right click and save to your Endote Styles folder or click, open in Endnote and then File/Save as into the Styles folder. This will work best if the references were downloaded directly from the [http://www.pubmed.org PubMed] database using Endnote.
