=Plasmid Construction=
==Transformation Result==
*R0010, pSB3K3 make it to grow. (Stored at 4 centigrade degree.)
*However, pSB1A3 did not make it to grow (the second time). Possible Reason: Yu Tao made a big mistake -- He grew the transformant on a used plate.

==Test the potency of competent cells made at 9th July==
*Transform 3uL proT into DH5alpha competent cells made at 9th July.
*Competent cells made with the standard protocol: ~4000 (number of transformants).
*Competent with an extra centrifugation during  <math>CaCl_2</math> treatment: ~1300.

'''Fetch E0040'''

==Another Tranformation==
*Transform 1uL E0040 and 1uL pSB1A3 into Mach1-T1 competent cells. (Thanks for the help from Switch group!)
*Incubate in 37 centigrade degree.

==Culture I14032, J23066, J61003, pSB1AK3, R0010 and pSB3K3 in Liquid LB (for miniprep tomorrow).==
*Antibiotics such as ampicillin and Kanamycin are added correspondingly to the LB media for each biobrick.
==Streak the strain JM109 onto LB negative media==

==Plan for tommorow==
*Miniprep of the 6 successfully transformed biobricks
*Making competent cells.

=oriT Knock Out=
*By Xu Anting
==Design Principle==
*Plasmid pKO3 is used as a tool for precisely oriT deletion.  Please refer to our protocol page and Link A. et al., (1997) J Bacteriol, Vol. 179, No. 20, 6228â€“6237

==PCR for oriT-Deleted fragments==
*Primers for cloning oriT-deleted fragments arrived.
