The Nobel Prizes are a terrific mechanism for bringing scientific, technical, and other advances, including the importance of foundational research, to the attention of many communities and individuals throughout the world.  However, the Nobel Prizes also exert a mysterious pressure on the communities that they recognize; the cost of this pressure is typically unnoticed and often goes unacknowledged.  Recognizing this issue, some individual researchers have chosen to liberate themselves from the influence of peer-based prizes.  This page serves as a open resource for individuals who would like to preemptively declare themselves ineligible for the honor of any future consideration as a recipient of the Nobel Prize.  <br>
