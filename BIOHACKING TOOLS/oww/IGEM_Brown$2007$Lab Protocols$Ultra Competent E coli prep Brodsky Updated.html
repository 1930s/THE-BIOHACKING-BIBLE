Procedure

# Inoculate a 10 mL of LB with a single E coli colony for an overnight culture. (its okay to inoculate directly from a frozen stock as well.)
#Dilute 10 mL into 250 mL SOB medium and grow at 25*C to OD600 = .6. (This will take 5-8 hours for DH5''alpha'' and XL1-''Blue''). This should be done in a baffle flask if available, and otherwise in a large flask that can provide sufficient aeration but cannot be contaminated.
#Transfer culture to clean sterile 250 mL bottle and place on ice for 10 mins. (the bottles should be rinsed with ddH2O and autoclaved while filled with ddH2O to get rid of all traces of detergent.)
#Spin at 2500g for 10 mins at 4*C.
#Decant supernatant and using a sterile plastic 25mL pipette, gently resuspend cells in 80mL of ice-cold TB. Do this by first adding 10 mL TB, and slowly pipetting up and down, and once they are mixed you can add the remaining 70 mL TB and mix by swirling the bottle. Keep in mind the cells are very fragile at this point.
#place on ice for 10 mins.
#Spin at 2500g for 10 mins at 4*C.
#Decant supernatant and using a sterile plastic 25mL pipette, gently resuspend cells in 20mL of ice-cold TB + 1.5 mL DMSO.  (DMSO does not need to be sterilized)
#place on ice for 10 mins.
#aliquot 50-100uL per tube and immediately freeze in liquid nitrogen.
#Store aliquots at -80*C.
