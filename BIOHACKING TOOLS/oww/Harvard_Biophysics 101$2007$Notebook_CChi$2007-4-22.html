==Plan==
I plan on looking into the SNPs that don't show up in OMIM.  More specifically, I'm looking into what all can be done with just the rs# when it doesn't have an entry in OMIM, or even backtracking and looking into what happens when the SNP is not in dbSNP.

*Look around for what can be done with an rs# besides OMIM
*Talk to Chris about the dbSNP and OMIM DOA


'''By 4/26'''
*[[Harvard:Biophysics_101/2007/Notebook:CChi/2007-4-26| 4/26 progress page]]
*Found constructive ways of dealing with non dbSNP, non OMIM
*Written relevant code
