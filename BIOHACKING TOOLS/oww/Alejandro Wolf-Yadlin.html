'''Ale Wolf-Yadlin''' (BE doctoral) in collaboration with Forest White (BE, MIT)

Analysis of signaling networks using mass spectrometry based phosphotyrosine proteomics. The first goal is to be able to quantify the variations of tyrosine phosphorylation over time at the level of whole pathways given a cue. The second goal is to be able to determine the effect of different receptor tyrosine kinases and /or different cytokines in the activation and signal transduction of a given pathway.
