'''Overview of tags added to protein to facilitate their purification'''

We are missing info on TAP-tag and evalution/comparison of the techniques. [[User:Jasu|Jasu]] 18:09, 3 March 2007 (EST)

== amino acid tags ==

A stretch of amino acids is added to the protein and enables the recovery of the labelled protein by its unique affinity. Usually its easiest to add the tag to either end of the protein to ensure its accessibility and not to disturb the protein folding.

=== His tag / IMAC ===

:6+ histidine (His) residues
:recovered by affinity to nickel or cobalt column

=== FLAG tag ===
:N-DYKDDDDK-C and others
:recovered with specific antibody

=== HA tag===
:fusion with an epitope derived from the Influenza protein haemagglutinin (HA): e.g. N-YPYDVP-C
:recovery with an HA antibody

=== MYC tag ===
:fusion with an epitope derived from the human proto-oncoprotein MYC: e.g. N-ILKKATAYIL-C, N-EQKLISEEDL-C
:recovery with an MYC antibody
<small>

== protein tags ==

Rather than adding only a few amino acids a whole protein is fused to the protein to be purified or detected. The affinity of the attached protein enables the recovery of the artificial fusion protein. As for the peptides, the protein tag is added to either end of the target protein.

=== GST tag ===
:fusion with the small glutathione-S-transferase (GST; 26 kDa)
:recovery by affinity to substrate glutathione bound to a column, e.g. glutathione sepharose
<small>

</small>

== chemical tags ==

=== biotin - streptavidin ===
:linking amino acids, often lysines, to cofactor and vitamin biotin
:purification by tight binding to streptavidin-agarose or -beads
<small>
:- [[wikipedia:Biotin|Wikipedia entry biotin]]
:- [[wikipedia:Streptavidin|Wikipedia entry streptavidin]] and [[wikipedia:Avidin|avidin]]
