Tomas and I were able to do some first and second order curve fitting on this graph but  was not able to get a percise Planks estimation. Our first order looked like 11e-34J. Does not see right..

==Methodology==
Following instructions in [http://www-hep.phys.unm.edu/~gold/phys307L/manual.pdf Dr. Gold's lab manual], I made sure the equipment was set up correctly to perform the experiment. First, one should get the light from the lamp as focused as possible by adjusting the diffraction grating/lens. Next, one should make sure light from the lamp reaches the photocathode of the <math>\tfrac{h}{e}</math> apparatus. How to do this is described in the manual. (perhaps I should upload the manual in case www-hep.unm.edu goes down again) following that, one should test the batteries of the <math>\tfrac{h}{e}</math> apparatus. I suppose the minimum ratings for the batteries are listed were the apparatus's test points are, so they are +6V and -6V. Measure using a multimeter from the apparatus's ground to each of the battery test points. I measured +8.70V and -8.69V, so the batteries were fine.
