==Overview==

Counting cells with a hemocytometer.

==Materials==
*Tube of cell suspension
*Hemocytometer
*Trypan Blue 0.4%


==Procedure==
#Combine 20&mu;l cell suspension with 20&mu;l of Trypan Blue. Mix.
#Load 10&mu;l into each of the 2 hemocytometer "sides" using the capillary action created by the coverslip and the hemocytometer. Avoid bubbles.
#Count the number of cells in 4 corners of the gridded area of each side. (See below) White cells are live and blue cells are dead/dying.
#Record cell count and repeat for the other side of the hemocytometer.
#If the two cell counts are roughly equivalent, average the cell counts. Otherwise, recount.
#Mean cell count/4 * Dilution = Cells x 10<sup>4</sup>/ml.
#Above example, Mean cell count/4 * 2 = Cells x 10<sup>4</sup>/ml.

==Notes==
#Average number of 3T12 cells on a confluent:
##T175: 35-50M (LSJ, N=2)
##10cm dish: 3M (VT)

#Cell doubling time:
##3T12: ~24hrs.
