{{Kafatos/Christophides Lab}}


Since OpenWetWare is a wiki, anyone with an account can edit any page they want.  And since the MediaWiki software keeps track of all the previous versions of a page, it is easy to roll back unwanted page edits.

'''To get started, use these [[Simple wiki editing examples|simple wiki editing examples]].'''

To keep things organized, there are a few guidelines for editing OpenWetWare.

===Use the "Kafatos:" prefix for new pages===
If you create a new page, start off the page name with "kafatos:".  For instance, "kafatos:Helpful hints on doing Qiagen purifications" is a better name than "Helpful hints on doing Qiagen purifications."  

There are several reasons for this.

#It helps others in in the lab to identify pages by the lab.
#It will tell people outside of the lab to be respectful of that page.
#In MediaWiki software, every page must have a unique name, so by adding the prefix "kafatos:", we avoid inadvertently using common page names that might be in high demand.

===Use the "Talk" page not the "Article" page===
To keep the protocol pages short and easy to read, please add comments to the "Talk" page for that protocol instead of to the protocol itself.  At the top of every wiki page, you'll see a tab saying "discussion".  It is a page automatically created for the purpose of discussing the contents of the associated article.  By adding your comments there, the main protocol should remain easy for others to read and use.  The exception to this is if you find an error or typo in the protocol, then by all means correct it.

===Sign your work===
Sign your name to non-minor edits to the wiki.  It makes it easier for others in the class to know who is saying what.  If you are logged in as yourself, you can automatically sign with your name and a timestamp just by typing <nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>.  Try it in the [[Sandbox]] to see what happens.

===Editing your userpage===
To get started on OpenWetWare, try editing your userpage.  Type <font face=courier>User:Yourusername</font> in the search box on the left hand side of this wiki page to go to your user page to begin editing.  Write a sentence or two about yourself so that other OpenWetWare users can see who is making which edits.  You can also add a link or redirect to your page on the [[Kafatos:present|labmembers]] page enabling others to find you more easily.

===Other===
Follow the general [[Etiquette | etiquette guidelines]] for OpenWetWare.
