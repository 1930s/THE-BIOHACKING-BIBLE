Electron Diffraction


Our final results were d1=.150+/-.0004 nm and d2=.088+/-.0006 nm and my notebook can be found [http://openwetware.org/wiki/Physics307L:People/Joseph/Notebook/071128 here].

This was an awful lab.  We didn't know what we were doing or why we were doing it.  I kept getting shocked.  A better circuit diagram would be great.  I think it should be scrapped or updated.  The intention is great, but its implementation is terrible.
