==Course Description==
This course will be targeted to physics undergraduate and graduate students who want to learn more about biophysics, although any interested student who is comfortable with calculus is invited to attend.   The course will be based on Philip Nelson’s excellent text, “Biological Physics: Energy, Information, Life.” In addition, a range of topics will be covered that are related to theoretical and experimental biophysics research being done in the UNM physics department, including DNA stretching and unzipping and fluorescence and optical techniques.  A selection of other topics where physical models or techniques have made a large impact on biological studies will also be discussed, such as protein crystallography, NMR and folding.

No background in biology is assumed.
