==Tail currents==
* Hodgkin-Huxley cannot explain this phenomenon
* We can consider model of channel where the gate sare not statistically independent
* Instead of looking at individual gates, consider the state of the channel as a whole
* Each state has a conductance and gating charge
* If n states and probability of being in that state <math>Pr[\tilde{s}=s_n]=x</math>,
** <math>g=E[\tilde{g}]=\Sigma \gamma_nx_n</math>
* Multiple channel state model with single conducting state can explain S-shaped onset of activating factor and also inactivating factors
** The slow onset is due to the intermediate states that the channel has to go through to become conducting
** Inactivation is explained by intermediate states which are more favorable to go away from that state

==Sodium channel structure==
* 6 transmembrane domains
** S4 has lots of charge and mutating removes voltage gating
* Mutagenesis
** 2 amino acid mutations can convert specificity away from Na to Ca
** can mutate to eliminate inactivation
