=SC medium=

SC medium contains yeast nitrogen base, ammonium sulfate, a carbon source (usually glucose) and amino acids. Depending on the specific strains and experiments different variations are necessary.

===Recipe for 1 liter===

#6.8 g Yeast nitrogen base (YNB, including ammonium sulfate, from [http://www.formedium.com/ Formedium])
#0.79 g Complete supplement mixture (CSM, from [http://www.formedium.com/ Formedium])
#Fill up to 950 ml and autoclave
#Add 50 ml of a 40% glucose solution that was autoclaved separately

* If solid medium is required, add 20 g/L agar prior to autoclaving

===Modifications===

* For SC-URA use 0.77 g/L CSMâ€“URA drop-out mix [http://www.qbiogene.com/ Qbiogene]
* For SC-P use 0.7 g/L phosphate free YNB ([http://www.qbiogene.com/ Qbiogene]). The desired amount of phosphate can then be added separately. We use YNB without ammonium sulfate and potassium phosphate. Therefore, ammonium sulfate must be added separately!
* To test nitrogen sources Yeast Carbon Base (YCB) can be used (from [http://www.formedium.com/ Formedium]). YCB already contains 10.15 g glucose! Therefore, add only 10 g glucose for 1 L of medium.

===Remarks===

* many different drop-out amino acid mixtures are available either from [http://www.qbiogene.com/ Qbiogene] or [http://www.formedium.com/ Formedium]
* different versions of YNB are available from the same suppliers
