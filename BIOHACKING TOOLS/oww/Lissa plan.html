== FUS3/Cdc28 --------------------> Phospholocator ==
'''Update:'''
#How to make Fus3 constitutively active?
##Look for papers where this has been done
##Mutate residues in Ste7 or something?


'''In the next few days:'''
#Improve SUMO gel.  
##Get better resolution
##Quantify amount of protein in each band?
#Pour plates.
#Grow yeast!
#Get pGEV construct out of e. coli (miniprep).
#Transform pGEV in to yeast so we can have linear expression of the phospholocator controlled by beta-estradiol.
#Order antibodies.
#Figure out protocols for using antibodies.
##IP has low yield... how to avoid this?
##Could run a gel with Fus3- and Fus3+ on it to locate Fus3 band
###Getting a Fus3- strain: use a Fus3/Leucine/Fus3 knockout plasmid
##How to locate amount of active Cdc28:
###Run 2 gels at the same time (one with anti-Cdc28 and one with anti-Phosphotyrosine)
###Do IP (probably more conventional)


'''Questions:'''

#Can you us the beta-estradiol system on a Gal4+ strain of yeast?  How important is it to have a Gal4 knockout, if you are growing on glucose anyway?
#Do we have beta-estradiol lying around?
#We're using an integrating plasmid.  Is this the best choice? (Apparently yes.)


'''Once we get supplies''' (antibodies - listed [[Image:fus3cdc28.doc]]), '''here are the things we can measure:'''

#Amount of phospholocator in cell.
#Relative amounts of phospholocator in nucleus vs. in cytoplasm.
#Amount of Fus3 in cell.
#Amount of ACTIVE Fus3 in cell.
#Amount of Cdc28 in cell.
#Amount of ACTIVE Cdc28 in cell.  

'''What to do First?'''

#First I need to see how the antibodies work.  So I should try to isolate total Fus3 and active Fus3 and measure their levels in asynchronous cells just to get a baseline.
#Do same with total Cdc28 and active Cdc28.  
#This means doing... Western Blots! (But not sumo gels.  That's only for gel-shift.)
#Should test the linear induction system.  Should set up 2 arrays of cells.  One of them will eventually be arrested with nocodazole, the other with alpha factor.  Each array will recieve a gradient of beta-estradiol at the outset - so some plates will get none, some very little, and some quite a lot.  (Note:  I have no idea what constitutes "a lot".)  Under the microscope, I should see 1 array of cells with varying degrees of cytoplasmic brightness, and one array with varying degrees of nuclear brightness.  
#Figure out a way to influence levels of Fus3 and Cdc28 in the cell.  Very important.
##Can use the ATP analog to do this.  Add varying amounts of analog; could perhaps create a graph.  X axis is [analog] and Y axis is the gain.
##Or you could add different amounts of alpha factor to try and influence Fus3.  Not as direct, though.  HAS THIS BEEN DONE? Find out.

#Longer term:  Find out how changing the levels of Fus3, Cdc28, and the phospholocator affects the system.  For example, does lowering Fus3 have no effect until a certain point?  Then Fus3 is probably in excess.  Can you lower the phospholocator to a very low level with no change in brightness? Then perhaps you could increase the gain of the system by adding more Fus3. 
#How is this helpful?  You could use the information about the inner workings of the system to optimize it to get a better gain.
