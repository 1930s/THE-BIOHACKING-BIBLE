== Questions ==

== Debriefing ==
Today's briefing yielded the following topics:

===Standard Units===
It was unanimously agreed that there was a need for standardization between the proposed chassis, and that a standard unit would have to be determined.
*The unit (for rate) proposed is the GFP per ACV (aqueous cell volume) per second.
*The concept needs to be well-documented, and relevant information placed on the wiki.

===Biofilm Formation===
*Protocols require refinement, particularly wrt the strains of E.coli used in biofilm formation. 

===Learn Vesicles===
*The day was spent scouring the relevant literature.
*Doubts were raised with regard to the protocols involving mineral oil - the proposed means of vesicle formation.

===Project Description===
*Needs to be ready by Wednesday, 8 August 2007.
*Logo
*A copy needs to be forwarded by Tuesday, 10:00 AM to both professors for approval.

===Wiki===
There is still significant confusion regarding the purpose of the wiki. The demonstrators suggested it be used more as a planning/organizing tool. Furthermore, the following :
*New menu setup.
*Status page regarding constructs used.

===Scheduling===

===Contact with supervisors/professors===
*It was determined that a weekly report be sent to the professors outlining the week's activities and accomplishments.
*It was also suggested that sub-project meetings with the supervisors be scheduled.
