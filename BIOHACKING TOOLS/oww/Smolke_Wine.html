=Holiday Wine Night!=

Instead of a top-down approach to the holiday party this year, we would like to see if holiday cheer can be an emergent property of component interactions - a bottom-up (or bottoms-up) paradigm.  Since wine night was a success (and very easy to organize) I'm proposing that the holiday party be modeled on this idea.  That means: bring what you want to drink, plus your favorite appetizers if you want.  We can get the CDS account to pick up the tab on this one.  We'll also be making cocktails, non-alcoholic libations, and snacks. [[User:Tsbayer|Tsbayer]]
