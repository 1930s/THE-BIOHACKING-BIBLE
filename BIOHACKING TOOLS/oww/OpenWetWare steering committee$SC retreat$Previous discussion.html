''Please fill in discussion topics for the agenda here.  Seeded with some of the discussion from the last SC meeting''

#What OpenWetWare is:
#*Online Notebook?
#*Collaborative Research?
#*Collaborative Education?
#*Novel Research Publishing Channel?
#*Other?
#*Can OWW be all of these things or are some of them mutually exclusive?
#What OpenWetWare is not
#*Wikipedia has something just like this [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not here], worth looking at.
#What sort of decision making processes / formal organizational structure do we want?
#*What is the role of the steering committee?
#**Maintain the site?
#**Evaluate/approve user initiatives?
#**Pursue our own agenda (open publishing, protocol repository, etc)?
#**All of the above/other?
#What are our goals?
#*Survival of the organism
#**What are the basal costs associated with keeping OWW alive?
#*Maintain the ability of the site to evolve
#**Keep barriers low for people doing new things on the site.
#*Have resources to react to new things that develop.
#**SC should be able to provide $ and resources to see though promising projects coming up from the community.
#*Grow and organize the community of superusers.
#**As it stands now, people may be less inclined to help since the SC is taking on too many of the site responsibilities.  And we can't do everything, particularly as the site scales.
#**Is there a way to seed interaction/cooperation of users with similar types of skills to contribute to particular "tasks" needed to maintain and improve the site? ex: group pages where people sign up to contribute (like to improving the software for the site), have lists of what needs to be done (maybe can be defined by the group)? May also want to consider having one or two "non-experts" in each group to make sure things stay user-friendly for those who aren't so saavy at certain things.
#What is the best path forward?
#Game plan for how to assess new funding opportunities
#*Funding: the private wiki installation idea that we've been discussing could have a suggested donation $ amount when you download it.  This could fund the development of the public site perhaps?
#*Based on above ideas, what types of questions do we need to ask when new funding opportunities arise (or we seek them out) such that we can ensure these sources can be used to support (and are not contrary to) the goals we have set for OWW?
#Changing wiki front page appearance
#*Should we consider converting our front page to a friendly cover rather than the table of contents?
#**Possible try making our wiki look less like a "wiki" and more like a normal [http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/FrontPage website] (with more style, of course)?
#*[[Jennyn frontpage|Beta-test]] of a possible front page in early brainstorming stages.
#**Includes items discussed during SC meeting --Video of the Month, Picture of the Week.
#**publishing on the front page?  links to new publications?  news?  Are we a publisher of novel research?
