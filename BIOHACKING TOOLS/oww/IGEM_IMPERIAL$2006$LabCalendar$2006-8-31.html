 <u>'''TO DO:'''</u>
 *Testing of T9002, J37016, J37020, '''S01656''', J37015, J37015RS
 *Culture new ligated part J37024 for mini & maxiprep on Friday
 *Miniprep 'old' J37024 (both plates)
 </font color>




==FIRST TIME: Biosensor Testing==
*Following the Biosensor protocol, the acylase dilutions were set up - they are stored in the freezer
*The AHL/enzyme mix was set up 
*Dr. O'Hare offered us to use the biosensor in his lab, so took over the samples on ice
*Take pH samples off ice & measure pH

*PROBLEM: Since the pH electrode is too large, the volume of 1mL is not enough to submerge the sensor fully in the analyte
*Thus, the above readings are not reliable
*Experiment has to be repeated with larger volumes (at least 2mL), and the electrode does not fit into an eppendorf
<br>
*Afterwards, the enzyme activity was assessed by using the relevant protocol (similar to T9002)
*Placed in the shaker at 17:00 - to be taken out at 21:00
*Froze cells overnight, to read GFP expression tomorrow

==Chemostat==

Make up test media dilutions for the chemostat. I will make a dilution series of diferent LB concentrations (keeping salts the same) to get a lower OD, idealy around 0.3 / 0.4 '''Then tomorrow''' I will use glycerol to increace the nutriant concentration of the media so the LB becomes carbon limiting, trying to get a glycerol conc of 0.8. '''Today '''I will also make media (LB + Glycerol that can support a population up to an OD of >2.8 '''[[User:JohnChattaway|JohnChattaway]] 04:25, 31 August 2006 (EDT)'''
Results can be found [[IGEM:Imperial/Results/Growth_Media|here]].

==Testing T9002/J37016/J37015==
*OD of o/n T9002 culture: 2.00
*OD of o/n J37016 culture: 2.00
*OD of o/n J37020 culture: 2.00

Put in shaker at 9:40. To be taken out at 11:40.

''After 2hrs''
*OD of T9002: 0.827         (innoculate 3.023ml culture into 16ml)
*OD of J37016: 0.947        (innoculate 2.640ml culture into 16ml)
*OD of J37020: 0.806        (innoculate 3.102ml culture into 16ml)

Put in the shaker at 12:10. To be taken out at 4:10.
<br>
==Miniprep==
*4 J37024 1 samples
*4 J37024 2 samples
*3 J37018 samples
J37024 ligations appear to be unsuccessful. Currently being religated (J37024 from scratch-PCR stage).
<br>

==Culturing==
*Culture up the repeated ligation of j37024 (II) to maxi and mini tomorrow.
<br>
==To do tomorrow==
*Maxiprep J37024 II
*Ligate to form J37025
*Re ligate to form part J37018

==BL21 competent cells==

*In order to determine whether the reason for lack of protein expression is due to the faulty aiiA gene or whether it is due to the DH5Î± cells not being able to express the protein succesfully, we have decided to transform the part <BBpart>S01656</BBpart> into BL21 competent cells.
*We transformed it using heat shock, as these cells respond better to this method of transformation compared to electroporation.
*They will need to be cultured up tomorrow (01/09) and then we able to do a Western blot on Monday.
