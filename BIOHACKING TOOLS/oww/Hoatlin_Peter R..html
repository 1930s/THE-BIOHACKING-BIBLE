1. Control of gene tx in Eukaryotes
*Genes and promoter
**RNA polymerase/tx initiation complexes, etc
**Tx factors and tx co-regulatory molecules
***Co-activators (acetyl transferase)
***Co-repressors (deacetylases, methylases, demethylases)
**Basis of tx factors
****Families
****Functions
*****Mechanism of activation and inhibition
*****Choose key examples (CREB, NFkB, nuclear receptor)
*Chromatin and transcription
**Chromatin structure
**Histones
**Histone modification
****Closed and open chromatin
****Silencing, developmental changes, acute changes
*Signal transduction pathways at the XX? of transcription
2.	Regulation of mRNA processing
**Splicing pathways and splicesome
**Alternative RNA splicing, diversity of protein expression, etc
3.	Regulation of mRNA stability/turnover/XXX?
**Short and long lived mRNA
**Classic examples-RNA binding patterns
4.	The new world of RNA mediated gene regulation
**Non-coding RNAs
**Slicing and dicing, shRNA, siRNA
**siRNA and XX?
5.	Regulation of protein biosynthesis

6.	Biodiversity of higher order chromatin structure and function
