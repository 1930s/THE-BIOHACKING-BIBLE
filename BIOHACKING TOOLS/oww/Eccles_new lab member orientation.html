===General Lab Information===
====Laundry====
All clean laundry (labcoats, towels and red lab teatowels) is housed in the cupboard in Hercus 215.<br>Dirty laundry goes in the yellow cloth bag on hook in Hercus 215.<br>Towels should not be used to mop up chemical or biohazardous spills.  Use designated chemical and biohazardous spill kits and paper towels for this.

====Biohazardous Waste====
We have numerous biohazard bins in our labs.  It is everyone's responsibility to empty full rubbish bags and provide clean ones.  Full biohazard bags are taped closed and are taken to the collection cage on the ground floor of the Hercus building in the loading bay.  Use the goods lift accessed via Hercus 215 to transport biohazard bins and bags. Your key works the collection cage padlock.  Clean biohazard bags in labelled drawer in lab 206 and lab 203 to fit the wheely bins.  Smaller bags are available in lab 210 and lab 202 to fit the normal rubbish bins.  If there are no bags left in the laboratory, more bags can be found in Hercus G01.<br>New sharps and pipette disposal buckets can also be found in Hercus G01.  Full buckets are disposed of on the top shelf of the collection cage.

====Autoclaves====
There are two departmental autoclaves.  One in room 215a second floor and one in Hercus 117 on first floor.  Please make sure you ask an experienced person to show you how to use the autoclaves safely and effectively before using on your own.

====Ice====
There are two departmental ice machines, one on each research lab floor.  One is housed in Hercus 117, first floor.  It is on the LHS as you walk into the room, right beside the hand basin.  The second is housed in Hercus 215a.

====Milli Q Water====
This machine is in Hercus 117.  On LHS wall above stainless steel bench and sink.<br>Push “operate/standby” button to operate.<br>Once pressure reaches 18.2 turn dial from recirculate to production<br>Let a bit of milli Q water flow out before collecting what you need.<br>Milli Q water is sterile, RNase and DNase free.<br>It is not necessary to autoclave before using.<br>Suitable for PCR.<br>However regarding RNA work, it may be worth DEPC treating this water as the outlet hose which dangles into the sink is probably not RNase free.<br>Once you have the volume you need turn the dial back to recirculate to stop the water flow.<br>Push “operate/standby” button to leave in standby mode.

====Distilled Water====
Each lab has a dH2O hose above the sink.  Autoclave if desired.

====pH Metres====
In lab 206 on shelf behind fine balance.  Portable and very easy to use.  Also have access to Stephen Robertson's pH metre.

====Balances====
Fine balance in lab 206, lab 212.  For weighing agarose and other larger weights please use Stephen Roberson's balances.

#http://genedb.otago.ac.nz/btc/<br>This link was set up as a way of facilitating communication within the HRC-funded programme grant for which Antony Braithwaite, Janice Royds and Michael Eccles are all principal investigators.  This link is useful as a calendar for letting others know when you are going to be away.  It is also useful for finding out what seminars are coming up.  All members of the DGG use this link for these purposes (you don’t need to be a programme grant employee).<br>
