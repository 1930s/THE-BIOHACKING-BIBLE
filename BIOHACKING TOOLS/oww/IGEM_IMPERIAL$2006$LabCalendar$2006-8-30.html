 <u>'''TO DO:'''</u>
 *Make Competent Cells
 *Electroporate J37015, J37024 (from ligations) after having made competent cells
 *Miniprep J37024, J37022 and J37025 (to check whether ligations were successful)
 *Religation of J37018 ?
 *Freeze 4G (S01656), J37020 (&J37018?)
 *Testing (T9002, J37016 & J37020)
 *PCR

==Competent Cells==
*New competent cells were made - we have a new stock in the -80{{c}} freezer again 

==Measuring the growth rate of the prey cells==
*'''[[User:JohnChattaway|JohnChattaway]] 04:50, 30 August 2006 (EDT)'''
*We need to do this to work out the growth rate of the prey to give us an idea of the amounts of media we need for the chemostat.[[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2006/The Talk Page]]
*Cultured fresh cells at 9.30
*At 11.30 will re-culture to OD of 0.1 then test OD every 30mins untill OD 0.9 is reached

==Measuring AHL production overnight==

*'''[[User:JohnChattaway|JohnChattaway]] 04:50, 30 August 2006 (EDT)'''
*I will repeat tom's experiment with the frozen Prey Cells

==Testing T9002, J37016 and J37020==
*Took 16mL cultures out of shaker after 2h at 11:20
*OD measurements:
**T9002 0.186
**J37016 0.218
**J37020 0.160
*Dilute down to OD 0.1 into 25mL
*Put 5mL tubes with AHL in shaker at 12:00 - to be taken out at 16:00
*Tubes were taken out at 16:25
*Fluorescence reading of the 3 plates (17:50 - 19: 10)

==Ligations==
*Part J37024 glass milk purified and electroporated.

==Minipreps of J37025, J37022, J37018==
*See  [[image:Miniprep_30-08.pdf|Miniprep_30-08.pdf|here]] for photo of gel
*Comment: The part outlined in the photo as J37020 is actually J37022 !!

==LoxP PCR==
*With any luck this should be the final attempt
*Ran along side the maxiprepped DNA
*Loaded 10{{uL}} of each PCR reaction into the gel (double the amount of the previous attempts)

==Freezing Cells==
*Froze S01656 and J37020 (the right ones this time - old ones have been thrown out)

==Culturing==
*J37024 (from both plates for miniprep)
*T9002/J37016/J37020/J37015/J37015RS/S01656 (for testing)
