''This is a work in progress.  Hoping to produce a reasonable technical report on the [[Endy:Screening plasmid|screening plasmid]] by June 1 so the iGEM teams can take advantage of it if they want.''

==Writing to do list==
===Qualitative inverter testing===

===Inverter library screening example===

==Experimental to do list==

===Test SPv1.5===
''[[Endy:Screening plasmid/v1.5]] would be a better fit for the iGEM teams since it would be more strain-independent then [[Endy:Screening plasmid/v1.0]].''
#Build E/X scarred versions of F2620/1
#Insert back-end of [[Endy:Screening plasmid/v1.0|SP1.0]] downstream of F2620/1 and in the process scar our S/P.
#Move this construct into all the relevant BB vectors (psb1AK, AC, AT, etc).  
#Test for expression at high induction (esp. for RFP levels).
#If it looks good then use it for Term testing, if it doesn't then stick with SP1.0   

===Terminator characterization===
''Should hold on this until SPv1.5 has been tested.''
#Empty screening plasmid (ESP) testing - get reliable.
#Insert all BB terminators into ESP (already in there for SP1.0)
#Repeat terminator tests.
