==Sequencing==
*I2055-ENX-2 : fuzzy read, not all of xba site is there, end looks good
*I2055-EX-B0032 : GFP isn't all there
*I2056-7 Re-re-confirmed that it's scarred and built
*I2057-EX : PERFECT!
*I2055-SX-B34-1 Most likely right all there and covered except for 87-130
**2nd sample doesn't contain b34
*I2056-EX-8 perfect, completely covered except for 35-200
**7 looks good too but not fully covered
**5 has a 1bp mutation
**3 doesn't have all of R0040
*I2056-SX-1 PERFECT!
**5 has a 1bp mutation
**6 is most likely good, stops around 650 of RFP
**8 is also PERFECT!
*F2620 : both 4 and 6 failed
*I2055-EX-B32 just had p1010, bad
*I2055-SX-B32 failed
*I2057-EX-J116 had not b0032
