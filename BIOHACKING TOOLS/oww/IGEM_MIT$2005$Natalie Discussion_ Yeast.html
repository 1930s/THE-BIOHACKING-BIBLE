<h3>Redesign Yeast Chromosome</h3>
*SGD = database for yeast (Google it)
Check out: http://db.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/search/featureSearch to get info like:
**Chrom 1 = 117 ORFs, 13 essential genes
**Chrom 3 = 182 ORFs, 16 essential genes
**Chrom 6 = 141 ORFs, 27 essential genes
*Chrom 1 is the shortest chromosome of the 16.
*Yeast artificial chromosomes are available.
**Resemble yeast chromosome. It is circular and can linearize. Has telomere, centromeres, and cloning sites. 
***This could be a way to move essential gene from chromosome and test from there.
*11/13 genes on Chrom1 (essential) examined for expression data
**Seem to do okay with glucose starvation.
***Look at kinds of genes on Chrom, and see what happens.
*Chromatin structure is sensitive.
*Drug marker (kanomysin resist) in the PCR product, transform into yeast, select for cells with drug marker. Haploid might not get anything --kill yeast. Diploid = spore it, 8-10 days. Technically difficult to do. Random spore analysis might work. To confirm, southern blot to detect. 
*Feasibility depends on what we choose as goal.
**Discovery project for sure.
**If goal for Nov. is for astounding re-engineering, project might be hard.
**Time scale may be more like a grad-student project.
**Might be good for learning microarrays.

<h3>Antibody signalling with Yeast</h3>
*Antibod frag fused to protein -> exported
**Fusion protein -> surface of cell
**Also tethering protein
***held together with sulfide bonds
*Would it be possible to put antibody frag into bacteria
*Bacteria are tiny = # proteins that can be expressed on their surface is less.
*Surface-expressed E.coli out there that have been manipulated
**Maltose binding protein -- change binding sites
***Hellinga paper about Maltose.
<h4>Signalling</h4>
*Multimerization signal - need polypeptides on surface to generate signal
*Antibody on outside would signal dimerization?
**Know that it's possible to mix-match DNA binding proteins, modular.
*Scaffold protein holds some components of transudction pathway, limits cross talk.
*E.coli would be great to work with for this because fewer components to pathways.
*Yeast vs. E.coli
**More E.coli biobricks than Yeast (5 or 6 in registry and are all fluorescence)
**More starting material w/ E.coli
**Yeast is eukaryotic --can be more useful for application.
**Bacteria could be first step.
