* 1 - None
* 2 - RFP: BP 565/30;  FT 585;  BP 620/60
* 3 - DAPI: BP 390/22;  FT 420;  BP 460/50
* 4 - CFP : BP 436/25;  FT 455;  BP 480/40
* 5 - "GFP"(actually YFP): BP 500/25;  FT 515;  BP 535/30
* spare: GFP (the real one):  BP 470/40;  FT 495;  BP525/50

* spare: Empty cube

==Maintenance log==
*03/01/07, new halogen bulb, replaced by Shay (old one blew out/up, due to power surge?)
*04/01/07, PROBLEMS: 1)CFP filter cube position is not able to perform z-stack.
*06/15/07, CFP filter located at CFP position, GFP filter is substituted by YFP filter cube.
*while doing z-stack, the stage shakes - reflected light shutter in scope causes shaking<br>
Solution: Adjust all settings so that shutter stays open and use shutter on DG4 light source (which is a lot faster anyways!)
*07/15/07, shift in register between images... Somehow (?!) settings changed back so reflected light shutter was set to open/close for fluorescence acquisition.  <br>
Solution: as before, Christine changed all settings back to using DG4 shutter instead
*070730, Doug installed new version of Axiovision (4.6.3)
*070808, Mason connected computer to MED domain.  "Users Data" folder moved to FS-SYSTEMBIO\PAULSSON LAB\Acquisition Scope\Users Data - shortcut on desktop!  Login to Administrator account locally, login to server at MED domain.
*070809, Christine installed a Hot-Fix8 to improve communication speed between "old" microscope and "new" Axiovision.  Also added scaling settings for 63x objective used with 1.6x and 2.5x Optivar, and 100x phase objective with 2x2 and 4x4 binning.  Copied Carl Zeiss\Data folder that has settings to C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Shared Documents\Carl Zeiss\Data.  Also at \\fs-sytembio\systembio$\PAULSSON LAB\Acquisition Scope\Users Data\Carl Zeiss\Data.

==Maintenance log==
*07/15/07, Jeff in to install software for joystick control of PALM stage (including Axiovision, as a temporary use license thing)<br>
Failed!!!!  Jeff couldn't get PALM and AxioVision software to recognize the camera at the same time.
*several intervening efforts
*09/06/07, Jeff tried again.  PALM recognizes joystick, but AxioVision doesn't find stage

*11/07/07 PALM and Axiovision were loaded onto the same computer, but you can't use them at the same time. It seems that you can't open up Axiovision, close it, and have PALM work...
