The main goal of our laboratory is to elucidate the biochemical and biological functions of the p53 tumor suppressor gene and how it is transformed into a dominant oncogene in human cancer.

Our work can be divided in two areas:

Understanding the structure - function relationship of the p53 protein

Define new tools and new targets of clinical value to improve cancer diagnosis
