==Mini-prep parts==
*7A->3O not successful first mini-prep, Dr. Mann suggested redoing ligation. However, upon second attempt to mini-prep, one colony appears to have successfully taken up the ligated vector (Gel E, Lane 2)
*12D->2H unsucessful ligation according to miniprep results (Gel B and Gel C lanes 2 and 3). Need to religate tomorrow.
*12D->24A not successful first mini-prep, redoing miniprep this afternoon. Successful mini-prep results can be seen in Gel C (Lanes 4 and 5) and Gel D (Lanes 2 and 3).

==Re-ligation of 7A->3O==
*Digests
**7A with X & P, using yellow buffer
**3O with S & P, using orange buffer
*Run on large gel
**Successful...was able to cut out insert and vector
**7A extracted 756 bp (insert)
**3O extracted 2091 bp (vector)
*Preform ligation after gene cleaning
**16 uL insert
**1 uL vector
**2 uL ligase buffer
**1 uL ligase

==M9 broth==
*We want a total of 200 mL
**100 mL 2x M9 salts
**6 mL 10 mg/mL thiamine
**2 mL 40% glycerol
**4 mL 10% casamino acids
**4 mL 0.1 M MgSO4
**40 uL 0.5M CaCl2
**Make up to 200 mL with sterile water
*See Endy Lab Protocol on OWW
