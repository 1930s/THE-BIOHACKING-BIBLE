Your annealing temperature is <b>5 degrees below lowest of the two the melting temperatures</b> of the <u>landing sequence</u> portion of your primers.  This step is done <b>for one minute</b> unless special circumstances apply.

(The <u>landing sequence</u> is the portion of the primer that binds to the DNA initiall -- it is only part of the sequence if you are adding on BB ends, for example, or it is the entire primer if you are not adding anything).
