==Single ion channels==
* Neher & Sakmann 1970s, Nobel 1991
* Patch clamp
** Seal pipette against membrane to measure currents (~2pA)
* Distinctive properties
** Discrete levels of conduction
** rapid transitions
** seemingly random
* Nothing like the macroscopic behavior from Hodgkin-Huxley model
* Model
** Integral membrane protein
** Selectivity filter to sort out ions
** Aqueous pore
** gate that opens/closes to let ion through
* How selective?
** Li can seemingly substitute for Na
** Can quantify selectivity
*** Set <math>c^o_{Na} = c^i_{Na} \rightarrow V_{Na}=0 \rightarrow V_m = 0 \rightarrow I=0</math>
*** Then replace extracellular Na with same amount of Li
*** If channels substitute Li perfectly for Na, no current will flow
*** Find the amount of extracellular Li that makes the current zero
*** <math>\frac{P_{Li}}{P_{Na}} = \frac{c^o_{Na}}{c^o_{Li}}</math>
** Measuring relative permeability of channel to various ions
*** Many different ions can flow through the sodium and potassium channels, some better than sodium and potassium!
* Linear approximation for permeation
** <math>I = \gamma (V_m-V_n)</math>
** I is the open channel current, <math>\gamma</math> the open channel conductance, <math>V_n</math> is the reversal potential.
** If screening of ion is perfect, then <math>V_n</math> is the Nernst potential
** Otherwise <math>V_n</math> is weighted sum of ions that can permeate
* Model for gate
** <math>\tilde{s}(t)</math>: random variable of state of gate (open/closed), either 0 or 1
*** average of <math>\tilde{s}(t) = x</math>
** <math>\tilde{g}(t)</math>: random variable of conductance 0 or <math>\gamma</math>
*** Based on <math>\tilde{s}(t)</math>, <math>E[\tilde{g}(t)]=\gamma x=g</math>
** <math>\tilde{i}(t)</math>: random variable of single channel current, 0 or I
*** <math>E[\tilde{i}(t)]=Ix=\gamma (V_m - V_n) x = g(V_m - V_n)</math>
* Assume cells have N channels that are identical but statistically independent
** If N is large, total conductance is about the mean = Ng
** <math> G = \frac{N}{A} g</math> (specific conductance)
** Same with current: <math>J = \frac{N}{A} g(V_m-V_n)</math>
* Model for state of channel
** First order reversible reaction for probability gate is open
** <math>x(t) = x_\infty+(x(0)-x_\infty)e^{-t/\tau_x}, \tau_x=\frac{1}{\alpha+\beta}, x_\infty=\frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta}</math>
