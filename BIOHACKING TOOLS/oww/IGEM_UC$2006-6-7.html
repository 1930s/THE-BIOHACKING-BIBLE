'''Goal''': We want to determine the antibiotics resistence of the F and R knockout plasmids (TlambdaOlambda)<br>
'''Results''':<br> 
We grew TlambdaOlambdaRlambda to early log density. We then streaked the cultures with pipette tips on LB agar plates containing the following anti-biotics:<br>
#15ug/mL gentamicin (G)
#50ug/mL ampicillin (A)
#25ug/mL chloramphenical (C)  ---errr, axe that datapoint, the plate disapeared.--[[User:JCAnderson|JCAnderson]] 13:45, 8 June 2006 (EDT)
#50ug/mL spectinamycin (Sp)
#25ug/mL tetracycline (Tet)
#20ug/mL trimethylprim (Trim)<br>
TlambdaOlambda grerw on kan only<br>
Rlambda grew on kan and tet only--[[User:JCAnderson|JCAnderson]] 19:07, 7 June 2006 (EDT)
