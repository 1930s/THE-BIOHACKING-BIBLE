#Run a gel of the PCR reaction and cut out the pGEV band. - DONE, but pGEV was not visible
#Pour little gels and debug gel-casting system, store -DONE
#Run a new pCR of ACLY700 and YAS with more controls overnight -DONE
#Put in new overnights (again) of parent, Fus3delta, Fus3Kss1delta strains. -DONE
#Put in LARGE overnight for nocodazole arrests (403 in SCR-u-h), and another one to make more blue-circle samples. -DONE
#Make media for nocodazole arrests - DONE  
  TY'S plate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -DONE

==Thursday, July 28==
#Run a new gel of the PCR from yesterday -DONE
##Run yet another gel of yesterday's PCR -DONE
#Beta-estradiol stocks. - DON'T KNOW HOW!!!
#Plan induction experiment -DONE
#Prep proteins (AM) -DONE, but it took them *forever* to grow.., load and run gels, set up transfer - NOT FEASABLE
#Nocodazole arrest, freeze samples. - DONE
#Gel extraction - DONE
#Make buffers -DONE
#Alpha-arrests -DONE

==Friday, July 29==
#Induction experiment using pGEV system - SADLY, DOES NOT EXIST YET
#Pour new SUMO gel -DONE
#Do another phosphatase/native extraction prep (with more CIP, buffer, etc), and load on a new SUMO gel.
#IMAGEQUANT

==Weekend, July 30-31==
#Saturday - will be in Western Massachusetts
#Sunday - will be sailing - evening: set up transfer of phosphatase gel.

==Monday, August 1==
#Pour new SUMO gel, prep nocodazole samples and load.
#Long incubation, washing and imaging of Western blot.
#Prep samples, load and run 2 small gels, transfer, incubate.
#Put in overnight of ACLY700.

==Tuesday, August 2==
#Long incubation and imaging of Fus3 Western -DONE
#Transform 403 in to ACLY700 and plate. -DONE
#PCR ACLY700 DNA, run a gel, gel extract, send for sequencing. -DONE
#SCBT (probably tomorrow)
#Order spacer plates. -DONE
#Math model. -THINKIN'

==Wednesday, August 2==
#Cut, transfer of nocodazole gel.
#Call SCBT? - As of yesterday no longer seems like a good idea
#Pour 2 small gels. -PENDING...
#Run a new set of Fus3/activeFus3 gels, set up transfer.
#Model -NEED PARAMS

==Thursday, August 4==
#Wash and image Nocodazole gel
#Long incubation, wash, image gel from Weds.
#Get cells of ACLY700-403 plates, grow up overnight.
#Figure out beta-estradiol stocks.
==Friday, August 5==
#Beta-estradiol stocks.
#Induction experiment.
