== CHARMM ==
Everyone is highly encouraged to post their findings about CHARMM here.

* prnlev MUST be set to at least 5 for the analysis command to work and actually print stuff (not in the docs I think).
* '''subroutine rdcmnd''' in ''util/parse.src'' is CHARMM's command parser.
* '''subroutine rdtitl''' in ''util/title.src'' is CHARMM's title reader/parser. If a line is read and it is not a title, a BACKSPACE is performed on the input stream, which is why if CHARMM is used using a pipe from another program, everywhere a title ought to be, it must be printed.
* '''subroutine seqrdr''' in ''io/psfres.src'' is CHARMM's sequence reader.
* '''subroutine evdw''' in ''nbonds/enbonda.src'' calculates vdW and other non-bond interaction energies for atom pairs. Similarly, '''subroutine egrp''' in ''nbonds/enbondg.src'' calculates vdW and other non-bond interactions for group pairs.
* ALWAYS do replicas and patches after the PSF for the entire system is present and final (including waters, if any).
