To order primers you need to go to the link below for MWG and get the lab password from Kalle if you dont already have it. Punch in the details for the primers and get the price. Then fill in the form and give it to Lucy for an ordernumber. With this number you can finally return to MWG's site and order the primers. Remember to save the primers when you put them in so that you don't have to give their details again.
