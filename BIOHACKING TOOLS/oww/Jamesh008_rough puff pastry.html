==Ingredients==
This recipie originally comes from the best cookbook in the world, Leith's Cookery Bible.

===Pastry===
*225g plain flour
*140g butter
*a pinch of salt
*a little cold water

==Instructions==
#Sift the flour into a large cold bowl. Cut the butter into sugar lump sized cubes and add to the flour. Add a little water at a time and mix with a knife until you have a very lumpy dough. Knead very briefly just to bring everything together then refrigerate the dough for 15 minutes.
#Roll the dough out on a floured surace to about 1cm thick and twice as long as it is wide. Roll carefully and try not to let the butter break through the surface. Fold the dough to create a three layered sandwich. Repeat the rolling and folding. Refrigerate for 15 minutes.
#Repeat step 2 twice more, refrigereating each time. Keep the pastry cold before use.


This pastry is best made just before use but can be made and kept in the fridge overnight.
