==Mode of Action==
Binds and cleaves DNA
==Mechanism of Resistance==
The product of the ''Sh ble'' gene binds to phleomycin and inhibits its ability to cleave DNA
==Usage==
After transformation incubate culture in YPD at 30 C for 6 hours to overnight, then chill on ice for 1 hour. Plate on YPD (pH 7) containing 10 mg/L phleomycin.

Phleomycin is pH sensitive--it loses its effect at low pH. When making phleomycin plates add 2 pellets of NaOH per liter to get the pH above 7.

The stock solution is 20 ug/mL (2000X), is light blue and is stored at -20 C. It should be stable for 1 year.
