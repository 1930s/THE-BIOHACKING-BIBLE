#Run Gel on digested E1010 and diagnostic ladder
#PCR Purify parts
#Finish standard assembly of vector + E1010 insert
#Check sequencing results
#Make Amp+Kan plates and do a colony screening

===Running Gels===
*85V for 45 Min
*E1010 digests came out fine
*Diagnostic Digest (used EcoRI and PstI to cut out insert, evaluated insert length) showed 3 bands.
**Eventually decided that the three bands were: desired vector, desired insert, F2620/B0034 vector.
**Will run colony screening using multi-antibiotic plates.

===Making Amp+Kan plates===
*If you want to add Amp resistance to Kan plates (or vice versa), add 10ÂµL (Amp diluted 10X, will be different number for adding Kan to Amp) per mL of LB+Kan poured on plate.
