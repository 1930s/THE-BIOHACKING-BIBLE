=== Materials ===

====500 ml 1x TB==== 
# combine in H2O:
#* 10mM PIPES (FW 342.4), 1.71g
#* 15mM CaCl2.2H2O (FW 147.02), 1.1g
#* 250mM KCl (FW 74.56), 9.32g
# adj PH to 6.7 with KOH, adj volume to 495 ml with water
# add MnCl2.4H2O (55mM, FW 197.9, 5.44g). 
# Filter through the entire solution. Store at 4oC for up to 6 months

====500ml SOC in 2L flask====
# Desolve 10g Tryptone (2%)
#*	  2.5g Yeast extract (0.5%)
# add 	  
#*        1ml  5M NaCl (filtered sterile) (final 10mM)
#*        5ml  250mM KCl (filtered sterile) (final 2.5mM)
#*	  2.5ml 2M MgSO4 (filtered sterile) (final 10 mM)
# adjust to 500 ml and autoclave
# after cool down, 
#* add 2.5ml 2M MgCl2 (filtered sterile) (final 10 mM)
#* add 5ml 2M glucose (filtered sterile) (final 20 mM)



=== Procedure ===
* day 1: streak cells on a LB plate without ampicillin
* day 2: pick one colony and culture in 5 ml SOC 37oC.
* day 3: 
** a. transfer 5 ml culture into 500 ml SOC, big flask
*** incubate at RT, shake at 220 RPM, (9:00am-2:30pm)
*** frequently check reading with 600 nm for cell density.
** b. put in ice, wait for 10 min, transfer to centrifuge tubes
** c. 4500 rpm, 10 min, spin,
** d. pellet should be small and thin, if large, do not use it.
** e. add 9.5ml TB, resuspend by gentle swirl, incubate 10 min in ice afterwards
** f.  spin 3000 rpm, 10 min, 4oC. 
** g.  20 ml TB for 250 ml culture with 0.6 OD, so 5-7ml for 500 ml with OD about 0.116. add 5 ml TB, gentle swirl and add 7% DMSO (350 ml), drop by drop while swirl.
** h. wait 10 min in ice.
** i. aliquote and put in liquid N2 immediately and keep in -80oC.
