Check out this article on document formatting.  In the example used here it's the US President's daily briefing document.  The author has some good discussion of why certain things were changed, et cetera.  Interesting reading.

===The Thrill of Discovery: Information Visualization for High-Dimensional Spaces===

Ben Shneiderman
University of Maryland, College Park

Abstract:

Interactive information visualization provides researchers with remarkable tools for discovery. By combining powerful data mining methods with user-controlled interfaces, users are beginning to benefit from these potent telescopes for high-dimensional spaces. They can begin with an overview, zoom in on areas of interest, filter out unwanted items, and then click for details-on-demand. With careful design and efficient algorithms, the dynamic queries approach to data exploration can provide 100msec updates even for million-record databases.

This talk will start by reviewing the growing commercial success stories such as [http://www.spotfire.com www.spotfire.com], [http://www.smartmoney.com/marketmap www.smartmoney.com/marketmap] and [http://www.hivegroup.com www.hivegroup.com]. Then it will cover recent research progress for visual exploration of large time series data applied to financial, Ebay auction, and genomic data ([http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/timesearcher www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/timesearcher]).

Our next step was to combine these key ideas to produce the Hierarchical Clustering Explorer 3.0 that now includes the rank-by-feature framework ([http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/hce www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/hce]). By judiciously choosing from appropriate ranking criteria for low-dimensional axis-parallel projections, users can locate desired features of higher dimensional spaces. Demonstrations will be shown.
