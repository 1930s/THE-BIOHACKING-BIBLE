==Discussion of Main Issues==
(make list as we go along. add an issue if you want).
#effect on viability: osmolarity of solution (pressure exerted on cell membrane) -- use sorbitol? 
#testing scFv: need a const. promoter with RBS -- biobrick -- do western!
#*jenny is point person, get materials to do western early next week
#scFv linker-fusion issue
#*why is the linker different than other scFvs?
#*can we introduce another linker, to allow fusion to preserve geometry
#*can we still introduce linker using primers? expensive
#Making knock outs: lambda red system. use a non kan, non amp resistance
#*Counter selectable markers:
#*#PurF (involved in uracil synthesis) -- grow in media containing 5'FOA, will be processed by PurF protein, keep cells from growing?
