== Personal plan ==

I'll be working with Katie on the web interface portion of the project. For next Tuesday (17 April), we expect to have a working prototype up and running with the basic query interface and OMIM responses. If there is additional time, I hope to look into some more info on looking up quirkier sequences, say through BLAT or BLAST. By 19 April, I expect to have contributed some notable refinements to the working web prototype, and may also pitch in where other help is needed.

(This text also duplicated on 2007-4-17 notebook entry, where additional work is to be done.)
