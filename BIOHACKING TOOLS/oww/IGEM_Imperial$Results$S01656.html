The IPTG has '''not''' induced the production of a protein which weighs 28736 kd ''(aiiA)'' this should be loacted inside the oval. We are repeating the expperiment to confirm the results. We are sequencing the part to confirm the results. The ladder is invitrogen marker 12.

===Results of AHL Testing===

*Used 100 {{uM}} stock concentration instead of 10 {{uM}}.  Used 800 {{uL}} of supernatant and 1200 {{uL}} of T9002 cells.
