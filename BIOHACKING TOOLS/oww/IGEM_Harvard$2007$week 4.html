=='''Electroporation 7/10/07'''==

1) Inoculate cells from plate or liquid culture etc.<br>
2) Grow to an OD of 0.4 to 0.8 which corresponds to log growth.<br>
3) Put 1ml into 1.5 ml tubes.<br>
4) Pellet via centrifugation at 14k rpm (max) for 30 seconds, remove supernatant and resuspend in 1mL of prechilled water.  Do this 2 times.<br>
5) For the third time, after centrifugation, remove supernantant and resuspend in prechilled water containing DNA at desired concentration. (50ng of DNA in 50 uL of water)<br>
6) Transfer to prechilled cuvettes. Avoid air bubbles.<br>
7) Wipe sides of cuvette thoroughly to remove water.<br>
8) Put into electroporator: for 0.1cm gap cuvettes, 1.8kV; for 0.2cm gap, 2.5kV.<br>
9) Press pulse button to electroporate. Record time constants (ms)<br>
10) Immediately resuspend in liquid media (1ml) with NO antibiotic.<br>
11) Let recover in incubator for 1 hour.<br>
12) Plate on selective agar plates to isolate transformed colonies. Grow overnight.<br>
