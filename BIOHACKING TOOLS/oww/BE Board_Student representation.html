One of the main functions of the BE Board is to represent the students views to the faculty.  In the past the board has represented student views to the faculty during faculty candidate hiring, visiting committee reviews and on numerous other occasions.

The board has provided input for a [[BE Board:Graduate Program Review|graduate program review]] in 2005.

When there are faculty searches, the faculty have asked the board to gather feedback on the candidates from the students.  The latest faculty search was in 2006-07.  Students can interact with the faculty candidates in a pre-seminar lunch, at 20.526 and by attending the seminar.

The department is due for a visiting committee review in the Spring of 2008.  We expect to participate in this by discussing student views of the department with the visiting committee.  The last visiting committee was in April 2006.
