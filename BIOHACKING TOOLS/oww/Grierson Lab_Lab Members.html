'''Research Interests'''

We are interested in root hair development and differentiation. Starting with the genetic network of root hair growth, which enabled us to identify gene products of central importance, we continue to pursue several gene functions in detail whilst simultaneously using "top down" approaches to the network as a whole.

Current projects (with relevant students, research staff, and collaborators in brackets) include:

1. [[TIP1|The function and targets of the TIP1 S-acyl transferase]] (Piers Hemsley, Nick Davis, Paul Dupree, Kathryn Lilley, Shaul Yalovsky)

2. [[Defining the network of ROP GTPase signalling and its regulation in root hair development|Role and regulation of ROP small GTPases and their regulators in root hair growth]] (Matt Smallman, Eric Lalanne, Sarah Usher, Zhenbiao Yang)

3. [[Grierson Lab:Back Door|Regulation of root hair development by auxin]] (Angharad Jones, Colin Lazarus, Ottoline Leyser, Kirstin Knox, Malcolm Bennett, Ranjan Swarup, Stefan Kepinski, Karin Ljung, Christian Luschnig) and ethylene (Dolan)

4. [[Grierson Lab:Further information|Root Hair Imaging]]. Developing high throughput phenotyping (Ronghua,Yang, Majid Mirmehdi, Tony Pridmore, Leica microsystems) and imaging and measuring cell wall properties with atomic force microscopy (Peter Dunton, Mervyn Miles) and turgor probes (Geoff Tansley)

5. [[Grierson Lab:Further information|Modelling root hair development]] (Gordon Breen, Peter Green, Julian Gough, Peter Flach, Alan Champneys, Isaaac Chenchiah, Nick Monk, Robert Payne, Nottingham CPIB).
