If you want to add a protocol specific to your lab, you should create a page using a format such as [[Special:Mypage/My protocol]].

You can then go to this [[Protocols/Template|template page]] for one potential way to layout your protocol.

Good luck and please let us know if you have any questions about using [[OpenWetWare]].
