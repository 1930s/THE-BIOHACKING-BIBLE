Abstract

<p>An all-solid-state, low-cost device for fluorescent wavelength-ratiometric detection is described.
Ultrabright light-emitting diodes were used as light sources. This allowed electronic modulation of
the light, simple optical configuration, and miniaturization of the instrument. Narrow-bandpass
interference filters were used for wavelength separation. Detection was accomplished by
high-sensitivity, large-surface PIN photodiodes. An integrating double-ramp technique with fixed
upper and lower thresholds was employed for conversion of the light intensities into time intervals.
The duty ratio of the output signal was a function of the fluorescence intensity ratio. Additionally,
the concentration of the fluorophore could be measured. The device could be easily designed as a
battery-operated version. It could be used for a variety of ratiometric fluorescence measurements.
