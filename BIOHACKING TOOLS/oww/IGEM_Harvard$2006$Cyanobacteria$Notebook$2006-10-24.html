==Results of transformation==
Plate with many cells on it; picked 8 to PCR (see 2 days ago for PCR protocol, except extension time decreased to 3 min). Expected value is ~2650bp.

Also restreaked; marked in chinese numerals :D in the fridge.

===SUCCESS!===

*Chose colony 6 (liu).

==Review==

We have (based on old numbering system):
*J36000: KaiC on geneart plasmid
**Sequenced
*J36001: KaiB on geneart plasmid
**Sequenced
*J36002: KaiA on geneart plasmid
**Sequenced
*J36010: Lac + RBS + KaiC (eg. J4500/sp + J36000/xp)
**Sequenced
**Frozen stock called "M2-7"
**Kan / Amp
*J36011: Lac + RBS + KaiB (eg. J4500/sp + J36001 /xp)
**Sequencing submitted, pending
**Frozen stock called "colony E"
**Kan / Amp
*J36012: Lac + RBS + KaiA (eg. J4500/sp + J36001 /xp)
**Sequenced
**Frozen stock called "A11" (I think, though I need to double check)
**Kan / Amp
*J36021: J36011/sp + J36010 /xp
**Sequencing not yet submitted
**Frozen stock not yet made
**Picked colony liu (6).
**Kan / Amp
*J36022: J36012/sp + J36010 /xp
**Sequencing submitted, pending
**Frozen stock called "colony 1"
**Kan / Amp
*J04430: GFP device behind Lac
**Nick made, demonstrated works
**ONLY Amp

==Western blot outline==
We are going to do the following "lanes:"

  1: J36010 in Top10, 0.4OD
  2: J36021 in Top10, 0.4OD
  3: J36022 in Top10, 0.4OD

  4: J36010 in Top10, 0.18OD
  5: J36021 in Top10, 0.18OD
  6: J36022 in Top10, 0.18OD

  7: J36010 in Top10, 0.6OD*
  8: J36021 in Top10, 0.6OD*
  9: J36022 in Top10, 0.6OD*

  10: GFP device in Top10, 0.4OD
  11: Negative control (H20? :D)
  12: Nothing

  *This OD value must be greater than 0.4 but less than stationary phase; any number works as long as all 3 lanes are the same

It is ambiguous as to what nm range the OD should be taken; I'd imagine 600nm through literature searches? The Endy protocol does not say the OD wavelength.

To secure the OD measurement, I assume one should:
*Either grow a colony to saturation or innoculate one from frozen
*Wait for the colony to reach ~0.6OD (DO NOT let it go above though, or it hits log phase)
**Collect a sample at 0.6OD; then dilute sample to 0.4OD and 0.18OD.
***1uL sample, spin down, remove LB, and freeze.
