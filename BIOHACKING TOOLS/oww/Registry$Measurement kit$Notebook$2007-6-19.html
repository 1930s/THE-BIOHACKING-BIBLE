==Colony PCR==
*Growth only on the Kan plate with Device B (GFP rbs tester, R0040 + I13401), doing a verification PCR on 8 of these colonies.
**Spun down cultures with other devices, plating them for overnight.
*See [[Endy:Colony_PCR]]
**note: 72Â° is the extension step. taq is in shared polymerase box in first room

==Prepared chemically competent cells==
*see [[Preparing_chemically_competent_cells|protocol]]
*made stocks of MG1655 and top10
**note: need more TSS buffer!

==Analytic Gel of Colony PCR==
*All but 2 had the right size. (will upload image soon) Choosing colony #8 for sequencing tomorrow.
**note: ladder in Controls box in -20, loading buffer in -4.
*Made overnight culture of colony 8.

==Ordered primers for E0240==
*E0240_F -- '''CTTAGTAG ''CAATTG''''' TCACACAGGAAAGTACTAGATGCG
*E0240_R -- '''TCAGCCAT ''ATGCAT''''' TATAAACGCAGAAAGGCCCAC
**in Vector NTI, go to analysis -> oligo analysis
