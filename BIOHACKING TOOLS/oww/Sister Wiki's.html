In addition to OpenWetWare, there are quite a number of wiki communities that focus on biology, chemistry, or other science topics. Here are a few of our sister wikis within these areas.  Please add to this list as new wikis are created.

==Biology==
*[http://biowiki.berkeley.edu/ BioWiki]: BioWiki is a wiki farm for various computational biology projects.  Maintained by the Holmes lab at UC Berkeley.

*[http://www.syntheticpages.org/ SyntheticPages]: Similar to a wiki, ''"SyntheticPages is a freely available interactive database of synthetic chemistry. We publish practical and reliable organic, organometallic and inorganic chemical synthesis, reactions and procedures deposited by synthetic chemists. Synthetic methods on the site are updated continuously by chemists working in academic and industrial research laboratories."''
