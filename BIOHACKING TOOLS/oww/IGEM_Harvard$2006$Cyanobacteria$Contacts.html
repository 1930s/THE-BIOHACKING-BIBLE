==Important people to contact==
# Prof. Alexander van Oudenaarden MIT
#* ''Emailed'', we can meet up with him when he gets back from Woods Hole first week of July
#* May have many of the genes we want already on plasmids
# Jeffrey Chabot
#* Post Doc who wrote the PhD thesis on cyanobacteria
#* ''We have his email address''
# Prof. Susan Golden Texas A&M
#* Is working on pretty much the same stuff we are looking at
#* ''Have emailed''
#* ''Have talked to on phone''-- see [[IGEM:Harvard/2006/Cyanobacteria/Notebook/2006-6-28#Phone_conversation_with_Professor_Golden|here]]
# Peter Weigele MIT
#* Post Doc who works with cyanobacteria
#* ''Have emailed'' correspondance (see Peng); can get PCC7942 strains
#* ''Have contacted'' and obtained PCC7942 and PCC6803 (a glucose-digesting strain)
# Prof. Andrew Knoll Harvard OEB
#* Worked with evolutionary cyanobacteria
#* ''Called''; gave references to other experts around the area
# Prof. Stjepko Golubic BU
#* Prof. Knoll said he knew a lot about cyanobacteria
# Prof. Colleen Cavanaugh Harvard OEB
# Prof. Woodland Hastings Harvard OEB
#* Corresponded with a Japanese lab group which works with cyanobacteria
#* Specializes in circadian rhythms

==Questions that we need to ask==

# If we put a reporter downstream of kaiBC what happens to it
#*It oscillates in cyanobacteria, but won't in E. coli b/c transcription isn't controlled
# What happens when we put a plasmid in cyanobacteria? Does it replicate?
#*Only if it is based on an endogenous plasmid. Paper from 20 yrs back...
#*There are endogenous plasmids (2)
#*PCC7942 has homologous recombination
#**''But we don't know if a plasmid will be maintained''
#**'''new:''' hybrid plasmid possible [http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=220131&blobtype=pdf on this paper]
#**Another hybrid plasmid developed by Professor Golden in 1983: [http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=6309751 link here]
# Do we know what the sigma factor is in Kondo et al
#* We can put in alot
# Possible ways for reporting if oscillation works
# Any other mechanisms?
# How bad is the codon bias problem / would we need to actually mutate parts of the genome to move to E. coli?
# '''Is there any feasible reporter we can have in E. coli?'''
# How to grow WH8102?
# Difference in circadian clock b/t PCC7942 and PCC6903?
# Growth conditions in liquid: use thiiosulfate? Hours light/dark? General streaking?
:# Ask Professor Golden about the plasmids pAM1579 and pAM1303.
