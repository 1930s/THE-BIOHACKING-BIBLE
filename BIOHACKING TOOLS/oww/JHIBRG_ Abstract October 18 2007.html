'''Noise in biological systems'''

Single-cell level study of biological systems allowed us to observe the phenotypic variation in a clonal population and subsequently to investigate the roles of noise in the structure, function, and fitness of the systems. In this talk, the sources, roles and controls of noise in gene expression will be introduced with the specific examples revealed in bacteria. It gives insight on how bacteria adapt in rapidly changing environmental conditions.
