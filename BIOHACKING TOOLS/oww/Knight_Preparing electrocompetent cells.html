Protocol from Austin Che and annotated by Reshma Shetty based on online research.<br>

==Materials==

===Equipment===
*-80&deg;C freezer
*37&deg;C incubator
*Refrigerated centrifuge that accepts 225 mL culture tubes 
*Refrigerated centrifuge that accepts 1.5 mL tubes
===Chemicals and reagents===
*~500 mL LB Lennox supplemented with appropriate concentration of antibiotic if appropriate.
*~600 mL sterile deionized water chilled to 4&deg;C
*~22 mL sterile 15% glycerol in deionized water chilled to 4&deg;C
*Ice bucket and ice
*Dry ice, ethanol bath
===Supplies===
*Many 0.6 mL plastic tubes chilled to -80 &deg;C
*14 mL culture tube for starter culture
*2 L flask for culture
*225 mL plastic tubes for centrifugation
*Pipets
*Sucking pipet

==Procedure==

#Prechill all tubes and pipets at 4&deg;C or -80&deg;C as appropriate.  <br> Also rinse all flasks with H<sub>2</sub>O prior to autoclaving in order to remove residual detergents that may remain on glassware from dishwashing.  This step may increase competency.
#Inoculate 5mL LB medium and grow overnight at 37&deg;C with rotation. <br> Use LB Lennox rather than LB Miller in order to lessen salt content of media
# Add the 5mL overnight culture to 450mL LB medium and incubate at 37&deg;C with vigorous shaking until the OD 600nm is between 0.5 and 1.0.  It should take about 3 hours. <br> For recA<sup>-</sup> strains, the OD 600 nm should be between 0.5 and 0.7 according to one online source.
# Pour the culture into two 225 mL centrifuge tubes.
# Place the tubes on ice for 15 minutes.  <br> This step can vary in incubation time between 15 minutes and 1 hr.  Longer incubation times may lead to higher competency.<br>''For the following steps it is important to keep cells cold and remove all the supernatant in each step to remove residual ions.''<br> 
# Centrifuge for 10 mins at 2000g at 4&deg;C
# Remove supernatant and gently resuspend pellets with 200mL cold sterile water.  <br> Initially add 10-20 mL of water and resuspend by pipetting.  Then add the rest of the water.
# Centrifuge for 15 mins at 2000g at 4&deg;C
# Remove supernatant and gently resuspend pellets with 100mL cold sterile water.  <br> Initially add 10-20 mL of water and resuspend by pipetting.  Then add the rest of the water.
# Centrifuge for 15 mins at 2000g at 4&deg;C
# Remove supernatant and gently resuspend pellets with 10mL cold 15% glycerol.  <br> This can be optionally transferred to a 14 mL conical tube.
# Centrifuge for 15 mins at 1500g at 4&deg;C
# Remove supernatant and transfer pellet to 1.5 mL tube using sucking pipet.  <br> There should be sufficient glycerol in the pellet for you to do this.
# Microcentrifuge 5 mins at maximum speed at 4&deg;C.
# Remove supernatant.
# Resuspend pellet in 1mL cold 15% glycerol.
# Aliquot 50 &mu;L per tube.
# Shock freeze cell suspensions in a dry ice and ethanol bath.  <br> One website recommended against using liquid nitrogen but did not justify this recommendation.
# Store at -80&deg;C

==Notes==
*'''[[User:Rshetty|RS]] 17:49, 13 June 2006 (EDT)''': Dont' forget to use the conical bottoms on the swinging buckets in the centrifuge ... not the flat ones.  Otherwise, your tubes will break.  (Oops.)
