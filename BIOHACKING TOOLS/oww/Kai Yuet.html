====High-Temperature Superconductivity====

High-temperature superconducting tapes based on Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7-x</sub> (YBCO) coated conductors have the potential to transform the fields of electric power and high-energy physics.  With the promise to generate devices with no electrical losses using inexpensive cryogen, this technology has the ability to significantly improve the performance of conventional electric devices such as transformers and generators and to create novel devices such as fault current limiters.  Type II superconductors such as YBCO are susceptible to electrical dissipation resulting from interactions between flux line or vortices and Lorentz force under an electrical current.  High current densities ''J''<sub>c</sub> in Type II superconductors require the presence of material defects and imperfections in order to 'pin' vortices to potential energy wells.  With YBCO conductor tapes nearing commercialization, there is a substantial need to characterize and optimize long-length coated conductors with higher current densities, longer tape length, and improved pinning properties.  We are developing several position-dependent continuous critical measurement systems for studying tapes produced by various deposition methods.

====Alternative pre-mRNA Splicing====

Splicing is the removal of non-coding regions of DNA, introns, from precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA)/heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) in order to produce mature mRNAs for protein translation in eukaryotic cells and enables 3'-end processing, mRNA export, localization, and nonsense-mediated decay.  Because alternative splicing substantially accounts for human proteome diversity, it is a desirable target relevant to many diseases.  My research involves the [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=gene&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=full_report&list_uids=4205 MEF2] (Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2) genes; MEF2 genes encode members of the MADS (MCM1, agamous, deficiens, serum response factor)-box transcription factors, and they have crucial roles in myogenesis and morphogenesis of skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle cells.  I am using these genes as prototypes to study alternative splicing.  I am trying to develop an ''in vivo'' reporter of MEF2 splicing events that could be used to identify and evaluate ''cis''-elements, factors, and signaling mechanisms that control splicing of these genes.

====Nanoparticle-Mediated Delivery of siRNAs for Cancer Therapy====

Targeted therapies have the benefits of lower toxicity and an improved therapeutic ratio.  Recently, RNAi/small interfering RNAs (siRNA), a new class of therapeutic, have generated much enthusiasm in their application to diseases, especially cancer.  RNA interference (RNAi) is a biological process of potent and specific gene silencing using double-stranded ribonucleic acids (dsRNAs) to target messenger RNA (mRNA) for destruction first demonstrated in ''Caenorhabditis elegans''.  However, the generation of an optimal ''in vivo'' carrier is required in order for siRNAs to develop into a viable therapeutic.  We are currently developing an siRNA delivery system for prostate cancer therapy that utilizes multifunctional polymeric nanoparticles to encapsulate and protect siRNAs from non-specific nuclease degradation and deliver siRNAs specifically to targets using aptamers, oligonucleotides that fold into unique confirmations and bind to proteins with great affinity.
