==Abstract==

Graphs are used in molecular biology for the representation of
relationships (e.g. protein-protein or genetic interactions), for the
representation of data (e.g. affinity purification / MS or ChIP-chip)
and for knowledge representation (e.g. in the gene ontology).

Bioconductor is an international collaborative open source and open
development software project for the analysis and comprehension of
genomic data.

===Content===

I will describe the computational methods for working with graph
structures that are provided by the Bioconductor project: data
structures, algorithms, visualization. Applications will be presented to
the analysis of genetic or drug interactions in cell-based assays, to
the exploratory data analysis of protein interaction data and the
estimation of complexes.

Links to online material will be provided to allow participants to
explore the presented methodology and software after the tutorial.
