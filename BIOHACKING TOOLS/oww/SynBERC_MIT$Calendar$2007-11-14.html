==Topic of discussion==
Eli Groban - Engineering a controllable switch that guides chemotaxis in E. coli.

Groban ES, Clark RM, Eames MA, Clarke EJ, and Voigt CA.

We engineered a strain of ''E. coli'' to sense its environment and choose to chemotax towards one of two stimuli. The decision-making behavior is encoded by a genetic switch that controls the expression of two orthogonal chemonavigation systems. In the true spirit of SynBERC, we produced this strain by introducing multiple components both from the parts registry and from various biology labs across the country into a newly created chassis.  Moreover, we will make both the chassis and the parts we created available for all SynBERC members and other research scientists.
