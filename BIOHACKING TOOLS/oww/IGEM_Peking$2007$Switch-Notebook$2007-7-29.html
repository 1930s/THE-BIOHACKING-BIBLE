==CD2-T send to sequencing==
after colony PCR and double digestion test result is right

==Rescue of Pla-T1T2, Pla-T1TE by electrophoresis==

test result after rescue: good with high concentration

==positive transformation of plx007/008/009 and RD2-T==

==ligation of RD2-pGEM-T==

transformation and smear onto plate

==rescue by precipitation==

T1T2 and T1TE, rescue after inactivation

checking by electrophoresis to see there is a slight band

==ligation of T1T2 to T1TE==

self-ligation as a control

==Colony PCR of T1T2-P, T1TE-P and T1T2-pcc009==

ddH2O 11uL

buffer 1.5uL

dNTP 1.5uL

primer F/R 0.5uL each

ExTaq 0.1uL

total 15uL

result: we got T1TE-P right!
