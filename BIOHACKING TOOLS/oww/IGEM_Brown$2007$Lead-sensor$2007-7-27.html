1. This week we made biobricks out of our new lead parts. We also hope to begin ligating these new biobricks with other parts and testing these devices.

2. Rohan is in charge of sequencing. Since we're ligating parts together into new constructs, it would be good to know if the correct sequences ligated together. Gels are a good way to check length, but sequencing the devices is a more important verification.
