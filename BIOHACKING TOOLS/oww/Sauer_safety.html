===Safety requirements at MIT===
*For now, check out the [[Endy:Safety Training]] page. These requirements apply to us, too.
*In the Sauer lab, it is '''strongly''' recommended that you take the [[Radiation Training|radiation safety training]] course. This will ensure that your research can continue uninterrupted if you find yourself in a situation where you need to use radiation. You will not be able to use radiation (including the XRAY source) until you have completed the proper radiation safety training.
