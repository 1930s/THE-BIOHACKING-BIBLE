==Draft Presentation Notes==

==Problems to be addressed==
#Modeling device/system behavior is difficult for researchers not trained in modeling.
#Characterization of parts/devices/systems needs guidance.
#Existing registries of models don't facilitate modular reuse.
#Difficult for modelers to contribute to the BioBrick effort.

==A solution to some of the above==
*The Registry of Standard Biological Models

==An example of a model entry in the RoSBM==

==Definition of a model==
*Kinetic ODE model
*Defined inputs/outputs (and units)
*Reusable and modular
*Compliant with MIRIAM schema

==Ontology==

==Services that could be provided==
*Store, search, and annotate models
*Interface
*Links to related papers
*Addition of  ''de novo'' part models

=== Biological Engineering===
* Goal: Building novel biological systems from interchangeable and standardized biological parts.
* Biobricks
** modularity
** standardized interface
** characterization 
* The Registry of Standardized Biological Parts.
** ...

=== Modelling Biological Systems ===
* Use of modeling in engineering and life science.
* Current Practices:
** models: quantitative, kinetic.
** Description languages: SBML, CellML, MML, Matlab, R ...
** Registries of models: SBML, CellML, Biomodels.
* Current Issues:
** some implementations are platform dependent (e.g. Matlab)
** difficult to share and re-use models.
** validation against experimental data.
** ... 

=== Registry of BioBrick Models===
* Motivations
** to gain a '''deeper understanding''' of the function of BioBricks.
** to promote the '''re-usability''' of BioBrick models.
** to '''explore through simulations''' the properties of de-novo assemblies of parts.
** to progress towards a '''faster/cheaper development process'''.
** to complement the '''open-source spirit''' of Synthetic Biology and open-up a new form of '''''in Silico'' contributions'''.
* Standard Biological Model
** Modular design
** Standardized Interface
** Characterization (Parameters, Transfer functions, Sensitivity analysis, ...)
* Expected Services from the Registry of Models
** Provide a one-to-many match between DNA biological parts and models.
** Store, Search, Annotate, and Curate models of standadized biological parts.
** Interface with CAD tools.

==Open issues==

* What type of models should be targeted (kinetic description, qualitative description ...) ?
* What is a standardized model ? What is the right level of abstraction of a model ?
* Link with the existing biological description languages (SBML, CellML, ...) ?
* Link with the existing model repositories (SBML, CellML, Biomodels) ?
* Minimal information needed to describe a SBM (see MIRIAM initiative), Annotation and curation ?
* Type of services expected from the RoSBM ?
* Connectivity with the other registries (Parts registry and others in the future) ?
* Tools which could benefit from such a model registry ?
* Project management: private implementation, open source project, release of a standard, guidelines ...
