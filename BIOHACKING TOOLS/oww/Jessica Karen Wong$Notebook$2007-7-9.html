==Sequencing==
*Minipreped overnights with 8.5 water
*Checking to make sure they're good: I2055-1AK3 (make sure constructed), E0240-1AK3 (see if scarred)
*Checking to see what went wrong: T9002-3K3, E0240-3K3

==3K3==
*Minipreped overnight culture from registry plate with EB
*Digested E/P using 16ul DNA
*PCR cleaned

==I2057==
*BB forward primer came in
**Diluted to 40umol w/ 485ul water
*Did a 100ul prep PCR to insert BB site
**Forward primer: BB_E0240_F
**Rev primer: BB_Backbone
**used Vent, 2:40 elongation time, and 53.5 degrees
*Looked good on the gel
*PCR cleaned
*Set up an overnight double digest with Mfe1 and Nsi1
*Used 4ul DNA and buffer 2

==T9002-1AK3==
*Overnight transformation had 3 colonies
*Made a 50ul cell suspension of each
*Did a 10ul Colony PCR on each, 53 and 2min extension time

==I2056==
*Set up an overnight scarring PCR
*100ul at 54C

==Gel==
[[Image:07.07.09.jpg|thumb|left|Gel from 7/9/07]]
*Ran an analytic gel on the Biobricking PCR of E0240, the Colony PCR's of T9002, and the scarring PCR of I2057
*Loaded: Space Ladder E0240 T9002(1-3) I2057
*The I2057 is very bright and seems to be the right size
*The others didn't work, retrying them
