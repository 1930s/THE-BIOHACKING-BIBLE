==Dynamics and Response Time of Gene Regulation==

Consider the following transcription interaction: <center> 
<math>X \rightarrow Y</math> </center> <br>where <math>X</math> is a transcription factor and  <math>Y</math> is a protein product of gene ''y'' whose activity is regulated.
The task involves determining the dynamics of the reaction, involving the concentration of protein <math>Y</math> and its response time.
Protein production is balanced by the opposing processes: protein ''degradation'' and ''dilution''. Degradation refers to the breakdown of proteins; dilution, a reduction in the concentration of the protein due to an increase of cellular volume, a consequence of cellular growth.<br>
Let <math>\alpha</math> be the combined rate of degradation and dilution, i.e.

<center><math>\alpha</math> = <math>\alpha_{deg}</math> + <math>\alpha_{dil}</math></center>
The change in protein (Y) concentration is the difference between protein production (first order reaction) and degradation/dilution, namely:
