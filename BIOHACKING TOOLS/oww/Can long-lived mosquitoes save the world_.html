== Hypothesis<cite>Mosquitoes06</cite> ==

A recent study indicates that individual green algae can be harnessed to move loads and perform micro-scale mechanical work: polystyrene beads were attached to ''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii'' and light of different intensities was used to guide the cargo-bearing cells up and down a 
chamber <cite>WeiGar05</cite>. We posit that a synchronized collection of micro-organisms could be used to vibrate a macro-mechanical resonator and energy could be harvested from the resonator. Factors that would increase efficiency and improve energy/power density are the ability of an individual organism to generate high frequency vibrations and the capacity to coordinate the motions of a collection of organisms. The basic premise is that of micro-power generation, namely the use of low-cost, replaceable individual “plants” coupled in such a way that sympathetic vibrations would intensify and prolong the output of individuals. Such amplification requires a positive feedback mechanism and hence robust and reliable mechanisms for synchronizing individual and/or group behavior. From an economic and net energy perspective, the costs of organismal husbandary need to be minimized and the process should be sustainable and practical under a wide variety of conditions.

One scenario implementing the concept of micro-organism power is as follows. Given the body of knowledge about mosquitoes, this invertebrate proffers a reasonable organism of choice. The wing beat frequency of a mosquito is approximately 500 times per second (''Drosophila'' has a lower wing beat frequency). It may be possible to select and/or create transgenic mosquitoes whose wing beats can be synchronized and coordinated by external stimuli and extracellular signals such as pheromones. Male mosquitoes are preferable to females because they do not transmit disease. Although mosquitoes in the wild drink nectar from flowers, sucrose-soaked cotton is used in laboratory settings so input fuel costs would be low. Mosquitoes with extended lifespans would be more cost effective than ones with normal life spans.

== Miscellanea == 

* Insect flight muscle is capable of generating about 100W/kg of power output<cite>KSJP</cite>.

== Practical and design criteria ==

*Sustainable and low-cost system for raising/maintaining male mosquitoes.

*Organisms with high-frequency, controllable wing beats: how to use genetic modification, selection or some other process to produce organisms whose wing beating can be started, stopped or modified in response to light, sound, temperature, small molecule or other external and/or internal signal(s).

*Organisms with extended life span: how to use genetic modification, selection or some other process such as caloric restriction to create long-lived organisms that not not prone to sarcopenia.

*Colonies: how to create populations that are robust to variations in the environment such as changes in temperature, humidity, and so on.

*Sustainable and low-cost resonator and converter:.

== Theoretical and scientific questions ==

*Energy density: what is the net energy produced (energy generated – cost of input resources)?

*Conversion efficiency: chemical to work (mosquito to resonator); amount of stored chemical energy.

*Information theory and energetics of communication between organisms: Shannon?

*System dynamics and control of organisms: Bode?
