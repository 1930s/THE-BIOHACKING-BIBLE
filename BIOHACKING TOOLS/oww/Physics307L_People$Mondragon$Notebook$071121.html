==calibration==
{{SJK comment|l=21:45, 1 December 2007 (CST)|c=You missed the fact that you were supposed to rotate the prism to '''''correct''''' for this mis-calibration!  Your data would be much better in that case.  (These methods may be appropriate after you've rotated the prism to the best of your abilities.  (Also, did you account for the backlash?)}}

{{SJK comment|l=21:49, 1 December 2007 (CST)|c=Did you really only take one measurement for each color?  (After calibrating correctly (above)), you need to take many "independent" measurements at each color to minimize uncertainty.}}

==CALCULATIONS==
heres the excel file
[[Image:L and T Balmer series.xlsx]]
Section above has numbers from the excel file.

here is a more careful analysis

Linefit says the calibration data fits the line <math>actual\,wavelength=(1.204205 \pm 0.042636)*measured\,wavelength-(76.833959 \pm 22.932003)nm</math>
[[Image:HgCalibration curve.png]]
==Error propagation==
No data on measurement error was ever taken, so, for any measurement of wavelength the error on the calculated actual value will be
:<math>actual\,wavelength\,error=0.042636*measured\,wavelength+22.932003nm</math>
The calculated Rydberg constant is related to the measured wavelength value thusly<br />
<math>
\begin{align}
  \frac{1}{\lambda} &=  R_\mathrm{H}\left(\frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{n^2}\right), n=3,4,5,...\\
  R_\mathrm{H}      &=  \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{n^2}\right)\lambda}\\
  R_\mathrm{H}      &=  \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{n^2}\right)(m*\lambda_m+b)}\\
\end{align}</MATH><BR />
Where <math>\lambda_m</math> is the wavelength measured by the instrument, <math>m</math> is the slope of the calibration curve, and <math>b</math> is the  y intercept of the curve. Because of the uncertainty in the fit, the calculated value of the Rydberg constant will have uncertainty.

<MATH>\Delta R_\mathrm{H} =  \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{n^2}\right)(m*\lambda_m+b)^2}(\Delta m*\lambda_m+\Delta b)= R_\mathrm{H} \frac{\Delta m*\lambda_m+\Delta b}{m*\lambda_m+b}=R_\mathrm{H} \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda}</math><br />
The uncertiainty in R<sub>H</sub> is just R<sub>H</sub> times the relative uncertainty in the calculated wavelength.
