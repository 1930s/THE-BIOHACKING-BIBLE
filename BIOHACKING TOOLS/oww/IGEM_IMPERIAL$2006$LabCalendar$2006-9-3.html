 <u>'''TO DO:'''</u>
 *Testing of T9002, J37016, J37020, S01656, J37015, J37015RS
 *Mini & maxiprep of J37022 and J37025 (CHECK whether ligations were successful)
 *Ligation for the final predator: J37019 + J37025  & subsequent electroporation
 *Repeat ligation of J37018 ? (has not been completed & successful yet !)
 </font color>

==Maxipreps==

*Maxipreped J37022(1) (colonies a&b), J37025(3) (colonies b&c), J27025(4) (colonies b&c).
*Unable to do all 11 maxis due to lack of maxiprep supplies.

==Minipreps==

*Minipreped J37022(1) (colonies a,b,c,d), J37025(3) (colonies a,b,c,d), J27025(4) (colonies a,b,c,d)

==Ligations==

*Re-ligating J37018
*Ligating J37036 (one of the final ones...)

==Culturing==

*Cultured up 2ml of T9002, J37015, J37015RS, J37016 and J37020 from frozen stick
*Cultured up 100ml of aiiA from Dr.Frey in LB medium for maxiprep
*Cultured up 2ml of 4 different J37022 colonies
*Cultured up 2ml of 4 different J37025 colonies
*Cultured up 2ml of S01656 + AHL + IPTG
*Cultured up 2ml of S01656 + AHL - IPTG
*Cultured up 2ml of 1M as a control + AHL
*Cultured up 3 colonies of S01656 in Rosetta cells in 5ml of LB
*Cultured up 3 colonies of S01656 in BL21 cells in 5ml of LB

==Electroporation==

*Had a bit of problem with continual blowing up, so used Kirsten's machine
*Successfully electroporated J37031 + 9G
*Unsuccessful for J37025 + J37019 (repeat tomorrow morning
