1. So, all of the J45600 LCs did not smell again even after gel extraction.  That was my last attempt, at least for now.  I will miniprep the LCs of J45180 (long osmY) and Q119B for sequencing analysis.  I submitted the samples at 2:30 PM.

2. Li Li was not there again today to help me obtain the exact concentration values.  I will email her today to see if there is a good time for me to do this with her.
