==[[Brown Synthetic Biological Systems Seminar Series]]==

==Outline==
A    multidisciplinary course that combines seven areas of science and engineering    giving undergraduates a solid foundation in a cutting edge field of    biological engineering. Synthetic biology is a mixture of biology, chemistry,    engineering, genetic engineering and biophysics.  It builds on    recent work in systems biology which involves the modeling of biological    systems, but goes further in that it involves the construction and standardization    of biological parts, that fit together to form more complex systems.

==Background==
In 1978 the Nobel Prize  in Medicine was awarded to Daniel Nathans and Hamilton Smith  and  it was predicated that "the new era of synthetic biology”  had arrived , where genes could be cut up, changed around and  put back together again to form novel function.  However it was  not until 2000 that the first examples of an engineered biological circuits  were published in Nature.  One was a synthetic oscillator;  an engineered strain of E.coli capable of cyclic expression of green  fluorescent protein, the other was a bacterial toggle switch  capable of switching the protein to be expressed into one of two states. Since then engineers’ interest and contributions to biology have created  a completely new field of ‘synthetic biology’. 
  
Synthetic biology is  a mixture of biology, chemistry, engineering, genetic engineering and  biophysics.  It builds on recent work in systems biology which  involves the modeling of biological systems, but goes further in that  it involves the construction and standardization of biological parts,  that fit together to form more complex systems.  One of the key  factors that is making synthetic biology a reality is the falling cost  of two key technologies, sequencing of DNA (now just $7 per read) and  synthesis of novel DNA (now $0.69 per base pair).  This fall in  price continues to halve about every 18 months and was recently compared  to the doubling of the number of processors being put onto computer  chips which also happens every 18 months.    If this pace of development continues then not only is a new field of  science and engineering forming but also a new industrial revolution,  based on smaller, cleaner biological machines. 

==Course aim ==
This course will aim  to you a thorough grounding in the theory and current literature of synthetic  biology as well as provide you with an up-to-date framework in modeling and systems  biology.   It will include the fundamental principles of engineering such as abstraction, modularity, standardization and composition and how these are being applied to biology.  You will get an overview of the biological techniques specific to experts in biology and engineering at Brown.  The course will also include a number of visiting lectures, experts in the field from outside of Brown.




== Notes ==
* Taught by interdisciplinary faculty
* There may be opportunity for individual or group practical projects in Spring 2008.
* Join the [http://groups.google.com/group/brown_synth_bio_course Google group] for announcements about this course.
* Open to juniors or seniors with relevant backgrounds in one of the key areas, or with instructors permission.
