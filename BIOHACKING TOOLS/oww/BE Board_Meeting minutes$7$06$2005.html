[[Kathryn Armstrong]], [[Jon Behr]], [[Ricardo Brau]], [[Diana Chai]], [[Ben Cosgrove]], [[Maxine Jonas]], [[Nick Marcantonio]], [[Megan McBee]], [[Shan Wu]]. 
 
==BE Board Budget (Diana)==
*Diana, Mariann Murray, and Roni Dudley-Cowans will credit the BE Board with the 2005-2006 budget, and make sure that their figures match at the start of this new financial year. 
  
==Faculty Search (Ricardo & HD)==
*Margaret Gardel will give an informal BE seminar on July 12, 2005. 
*BE Board members will meet with her that same afternoon.  
  
==Elections of the 2005-2006 BE Board==
*Mid-August, a new BE Board will be elected through an online process. 
*Nominations will be open early August 2005. 
*In the coming years, reducing the number of BE Board members attending meetings may be relevant and efficient, although it does not seem to be a necessary step at the present time (appointed officers tend to be more committed to getting things done, and meetings can be kept short and insightful with our current small group). 
 
==End of the Year Survey (Ben & Nick)==
*An end-of-the-year survey will be put together and either handed out during the July BE BBQ/softball social event, or distributed online. 
 
==BE Diversity (Jon, Nate & Maxine)==
*BE Diversity will hold a meeting in July 2005, to probe for interest in participating in next yearâ€™s event organization, and to start planning those. 
*A Puerto Rican cultural event will be held in August 2005. 
 
==Social Events (Kathryn, Megan & Nate)==
*A BE BBQ/softball afternoon will take place on Sunday, July 17, 2005.  Alcohol will be authorized. 
 
==First-year Questions (Shan)==
*All the first years passed their written qualifying exams.  Congratulations! 
*They subsequently met with Doug Lauffenburger and gave him suggestions as to how to make BE.420 and BE.400 more useful, more practically targeted. 
*How can we better integrate the CSBi PhD candidates into our BE Division?  Do they wish us to do so?
