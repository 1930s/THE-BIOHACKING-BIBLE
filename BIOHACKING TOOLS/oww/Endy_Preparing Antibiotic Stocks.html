==[[Ampicillin]]==
===Stocks & Usage===
*'''Stock Concentration''' - 50mg/ml in H<sub>2</sub>O
*'''Aliquots''' - 100&mu;l and 500&mu;l
*'''Working Concentration''' - 50&mu;g/ml

===Preparation of 80ml stock solution===
*Ampicillin is kept in the 4C fridge in 68-564D.  It is light sensitive.
*Weigh 4g of ampicillin into a small weigh boat.
*Add 80ml of milliQ to a 250ml bottle.
*Add the ampicillin to the milliQ
*Mix/vortex so all the ampicillin goes into solution.
*Filter sterilize the solution into a falcon tube using a 20ml syringe and a 200nm filter.
*Aliquot into pcr tubes and 1.7ml eppendorfs.
*Store at -20C.
*Store the small aliquots in the small box and the big aliquots in the larger box.

==[[Kanamycin]]==
===Stocks & Usage===
*'''Stock Concentration''' - 10mg/ml in H<sub>2</sub>O
*'''Aliquots''' - 200&mu;l and 1ml
*'''Working Concentration''' - 20&mu;g/ml
===Preparation of 80ml stock solution===
*Kanamycin is kept in the 4C fridge in 68-564D.  It is light sensitive.
*Weigh 800mg of kanamycin into a small weigh boat.
*Add 80ml of milliQ to a 250ml bottle.
*Add the kanamycin to the milliQ
*Mix/vortex so all the kanamycin goes into solution.
*Filter sterilize the solution into a falcon tube using a 20ml syringe and a 200nm filter.
*Aliquot into pcr tubes and 1.7ml eppendorfs.
*Store at -20C.
*Store the small aliquots in the small box and the big aliquots in the larger box.

==[[Tetracycline]]==
===Stocks & Usage===
*'''Stock Concentration''' - 5mg/ml in 70% Ethanol
*'''Aliquots''' - 200&mu;l and 1ml
*'''Working Concentration''' - 20&mu;g/ml
===Preparation of 80ml stock solution===
*Tetracycline is kept in the 4C fridge in 68-564D.  It is light sensitive.
*Weigh 400mg of tetracyline HCL into a small weigh boat.
*Dilute 95% Ethanol to 70% using milliQ water.
**Adding 20ml of milliQ to 60ml of 95% ethanol gives 80ml of 71% ethanol.
*Add 80ml of 70% Ethanol to a 250ml bottle.
*Add the tetracycline HCL to the ethanol.
*Mix/vortex vigorously so all the tetracycline goes into solution.
*Filter sterilize the solution into a falcon tube using a 20ml syringe and a 200nm filter.
*Aliquot into pcr tubes and 1.7ml eppendorfs.
*Store at -20C and protect any unused stock solution from light.
*Store the small aliquots in the small box and the big aliquots in the larger box.

== [[Chloramphenicol]] ==
* '''Stock concentration''' - 34mg/ml in 100% Ethanol
* '''Aliquots''' - 1ml
* '''Working concentration''' = 25&mu;/ml (Stringent), 170&mu;/ml (relaxed)
=== Preparation of 80ml stock solution ===
*Chloramphenicol is kept at room temperature. It is near our other chemicals
*Weight 2.72g of chloramphenicol sulfate into a small weight boat.
*Add 80ml 100% EtOH to the chloramphenicol
**95% EtOH probably works just fine, but I haven't tried it.
*Mix/vortex vigorously so all the chloramphenicol goes into solution.
*Aliquot into 1.7ml eppendorfs.
** N.B. There is no need to filter sterilize, as it is in EtOH.
*Store at -20C.

==Streptomycin==
===Stocks & Usage===
*'''Stock Concentration:''' 50mg/ml in H<sub>2</sub>O
*'''Aliquots''' - 0.5 ml
*'''Working Concentration''' - 10-50&mu;g/ml
===Preparation of 40ml stock solution===
*Streptomycin is kept in the 4C fridge in 68-564D.  I don't think it is light sensitive (not stored in opaque bottle).
*Weigh 2g of streptomycin into a small weigh boat.
*Add 40ml of milliQ to a 100 or 250ml bottle.
*Add the streptomycin to the milliQ
*Mix/vortex so all the streptomycin goes into solution.
*Filter sterilize the solution into a falcon tube using a 60ml syringe and a 200nm filter.
*Aliquot into 1.7ml eppendorfs.
*Store at -20C.
