Welcome to '''[[Tregwiki:Max|Max's]] Wiki on Transcriptional Regulation'''. ([[Tregwiki:Max|who's max?]])

''"Man is a tool-using Animal. Nowhere do you find him without tools; without tools he is nothing, with tools he is all." (Thomas Carlyle)''

I am collecting links related to bioinformatics and binding site prediction ([[Tregwiki:Why is this a difficult problem|Why is this a difficult problem]]?).
There are usually many different solutions for every problem in bioinformatics. This list might shorten your mileage when choosing an appropriate one.

* Promotors/Enhancers/Regulatory Regions:
** Assemble: [[Tregwiki:Assembling promotors from trace databases|Assembling promotors from trace databases]]
** Narrow down: [[Tregwiki:Predict promotor regions|Predict promotors/enhancers]] in silico
** Check if ncRNA: [[Tregwiki:Folding Alignments|Folding Alignments]]
** Find Orthologs: [[Tregwiki:Finding interspecies-orthologs|Finding interspecies-orthologs]] for multiple alignments
** Sort by Function: [[Tregwiki:Gene Ontology Tools|Gene Ontology Tools]]
** Download: [[Tregwiki:Downloading promotors|Downloading promotors]] aka upstream regions ''en masse''
** Align: [[Tregwiki:Aligning promotors|Align non-coding sequences]] or use [[Tregwiki:Whole-Genome Alignments|Whole-Genome Alignments]] to [[Tregwiki:FindConservedNoncoding|delineate conserved non-coding]] elements
** Visualize [[Tregwiki:Multi-sequence visualization of features|Multi-sequence visualization of features]]
** Altogether: [[Tregwiki:Enhancerprediction|Prediction of clusters of sites]] with optional conservation

*Binding sites:
** Look up: In databases of known [[Tregwiki:Collected regulatory elements|Collected regulatory elements]]
** Scan: [[Tregwiki:Scanning promotors|Scanning promotors]] or enhancers for binding site matrices or consensus sequences
** Predict: [http://www.stud.uni-potsdam.de/~haussler/master Discover motifs], [[Tregwiki:Calculate statistics|Calculate statistics]] of DNA-words or [[[Tregwiki:Discover motif combinations|Discover motif combinations]]

*Transcription Factors: (new)

There are a couple of [[Tregwiki:Similar link collections|Similar link collections]] on the web.
Sometimes [[Tregwiki:Gene Ontology related|Gene Ontology related]] tools are useful when working with transcriptional regulation.
