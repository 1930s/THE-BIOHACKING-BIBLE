== Environmental Sensors ==

Endogeneous promoters sensitive to the different environments may be discovered by microarray analysis, or RIVET-like analysis of cells grown in the appropriate environments. These will need spec sheets made for them. However, how one makes pluggable, dynamic range tunable, synthetic systems for sensing is still an open question.
