===Electrocompetent cell prep 01/16/07===

*Primary cultures grown overnight at 37deg in LB from single colonies of MC1061, PMB14, PMB27

*Secondary cultures: measured in NanoDrop (NB: 1mm path length!!!)<br>
MC1061: inoculated approx. (2x) 300ml LB with 1ml... 3.5hrs later OD600 ~ 0.06, <br>
PMB14:  inoculated approx. 300ml LB with 1ml... 3hrs later OD600 = 0.075<br>
PMB27:  inoculated approx. 300ml LB with 1ml... 3hrs later OD600 = 0.077<br>

*Followed CP method, using solutions and tubes pre-cooled in ice water baths, pipets and pipet tips pre-cooled at -20deg.

Washed with 275ml water.<br>

Very loose pellet after water washes.  Resuspended in approximately 45ml residual supernatant, then added 900ul 50% glycerol.  Pelleted cells.<br
>Aprrox. 450ul packed cells per tube.  Resuspended with 500 - 600ul 10% glycerol in water, yielding approx. 1ml of cell suspension per 300ml culture.  Dispensed in 95ul aliquots using cut tips (wide-mouth).  Froze in pre-cooled (-20deg) microfuge tubes.  Stored at -80deg.  All labels have strain names in RED ink.<br>

*Transformation test
Thawed cells.  Added 1ul 1ng/ul pPM3 pDNA.  Flicked tube and transfered to 0.2cm e-poration cuvette.  Zapped using MicroPulser on setting "Ec2".  Immediately added 1ml SOC, mixed cells, transfered to culture tube.  Shook at 30deg for 60 min.<br>

Made serial 10-fold dilutions (1/10 to 1/10,000) and plated 100ul cells onto LB/Amp.  Grew o/n at 30deg.  (100 cells on 1/1000 dilution = 10(6) cells per ng of pDNA)

MC1061....... 6 x 10(9) cells / ug pDNA<br>
PMB14........ 3 x 10(7) cells / ug pDNA<br>
PMB27........ 3 x 10(7) cells / ug pDNA<br>
