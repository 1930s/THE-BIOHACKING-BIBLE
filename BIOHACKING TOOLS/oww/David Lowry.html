==About Me==
I am a fourth year graduate student in the [http://upg.duke.edu/ Duke University Program in Genetics and Genomics], who hails from the redwood empire and wine country of Northern California.  I spent 4.5 years of long latte-drinking nights at UC Berkeley during the thrilling boom and crash of the dot-com era.  After college, I set out to explore the finer delights of world cultures and wildlife before joining the grind of graduate school.  Alas, my time at [http://www.duke.edu Duke] has been good to me thanks to many fantastic people and my amazingly optimistic leader/advisor, [http://www.biology.duke.edu/willislab/ Dr. Johh Willis]. 
 

The focus of my research is directed toward understanding the genetics of adaptation and speciation.  To this end, I have chosen to study how divergent adaptation of the yellow monkey flower (''Mimulus guttatus''), to the coast versus inland habitat, contributes to reproductive isolation.  I am using a combination of QTL mapping, candidate gene strategies, and microarrays (should have them by Spring of 2008) to determine the genetic mechanisms that underlie the divergence of morphological and life-history traits between coast and inland ''Mimulus''.  Further, I have carried out reciprocal transplant experiments and population genetic analysis to demonstrate that coast and inland ''Mimulus'' are locally adapted and reproductively isolated.  In the future, I plan on creating near isogenic lines, with QTLs of large effect, for field experiments to test hypotheses of adaptation and ecogeographic reproductive isolation.

==Quotes==
"There is keen delight in the quick experience, of knowing that no harm comes of a wetting at high canon wall, slips up behind the ridge to cross it by some windy broad-leaved hellebore, and beat down the mimulus beside the brook." -Mary Austin
