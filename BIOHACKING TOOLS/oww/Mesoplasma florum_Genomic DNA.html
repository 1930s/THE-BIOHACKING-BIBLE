Extraction of genomic DNA from Mesoplasma florum

==Materials==

* ATCC 1161 culture medium
* TE
* 10% SDS solution
* Proteinase-K 20 mg/ml solution
* 5 M NaCl solution
* CTAB / NaCl solution
** CTAB 10%, NaCl 700 mM
** dissolve 4.1 g NaCl in 80 ml water, and slowly mix and add 10 g CTAB (hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide) heating to 65&deg; if necessary.  Bring the solution to 100 ml.
* chlorform / isoamyl alcohol 24:1
* phenol / chloroform / isoamyl alcohol 25:24:1
* Novagen Pellet Paint NF
* isopropanol
* 70% ethanol

==Protocol==

* Culture 10 ml of medium 1161 infected with Mesoplasma florum in a 15 ml centrifuge tubes at 30&deg; without shaking.
* Transfer 2x 1.8 ml into two 2 ml tubes.  Spin down at 17000g for 2 minutes and retain the pellet.
* Resuspend the pellet by vortexing first, then adding 567 &mu;l of TE.
* Add 3 &mu;l of proteinase-K 20 mg/ml and 30 &mu;l of SDS 10% solution, mix and incubate at 37&deg; for 1 hour
* Add 100 &mu;l of 5 M  NaCl and mix (critical before adding CTAB)
* Add 80 &mu;l of CTAB / NaCl solution, mix
* Incubate 10 minutes at 65&deg;
* Add an equal volume (800 &mu;l) of chloroform / isoamyl alcohol 24:1, vortex and spin down at 17000g for 2 minutes
* Setup fresh 2 ml tubes with 800 &mu;l  of phenol / chloroform / isoamyl alcohol 25:24:1, transfer the supernatent,  and mix carefully.
* Spin down at 17000g for 2 minutes
* Setup fresh 2 ml tubes with 800 &mu;l of chloroform / isoamyl alcohol 24:1, transfer the supernatent, and mix carefully.
* Spin down at 17000g for 2 minutes
* Setup fresh 1.5 ml tubes loaded with 1 &mu;l Novagen Pellet Paint NF and transfer the supernatent into those tubes.
* Add 0.6 volumes of isopropanol and chill in the -80 freezer for 30 minutes
* Spin down at 17000g for 20 minutes and remove the supernatent carefully retaining the blue pellet.
* Fill the tube with 70% ethanol to wash, and spin down at 17000g for 2 minutes.
* Remove the ethanol carefully leaving the blue pellet.  This is best done by using a 1 ml pipet to remove the bulk of the ethanol, then a 10 &mu;l tip to remove the remainder.  Spinning the tube down after most of the ethanol is removed will assist in removing the last 10-20 &mu;l.
* Let the tube  air dry for 1/2 hour until the ethanol odor is no longer present.
* Redissolve the DNA pellet in 100 &mu;l TE (this will take an hour or so).
* Spin down the tube briefly and measure OD and 260/280 ratios.
* Expect around 500 ng/&mu;l concentration (total 50 &mu;g).


A critical element is the NaCl concentration prior to adding CTAB.  With < 500 mM NaCl, DNA precipitates.  Above that point, polysaccharides and proteins precipitate, but the DNA stays in solution.
