==Recommendations==
Papers that at least one of us has read and enjoyed, with a short summary and explanation of relevance.

* Important mathematical background that underlies transcriptional regulation, the most prevalent feedback system in biology.  I find it interesting that biology separates (to some degree) the amount of protein expressed from a protein's function, and this separation allows for control over the number of proteins in the cell. -[[User:Kelsic|Kelsic]] <cite>Phillips1</cite>

* Modular functional modeling of feedback mechanisms in the heat shock response.  An example of how protein numbers can be controlled via feedback vs. parameter tuning. <cite>Doyle</cite>

* Experiment and modelling that demonstrate how negative transcriptional regulation can change the time-response of a genetic circuit.<cite>Elowitz</cite>

* Engineeging implementation of negative transcriptional feedback for control over the variance of protein distributions.  An example of how transcriptional feedback can be used for precise gene control.<cite>Becskei</cite>

*Theoretical paper discussing the minimum number of molecules required to perform stable switching.  It's article #74 on his [http://www.princeton.edu/~wbialek/publications_wbialek.html publications page] -Milo

*  A quorum sensing system regulates a gene that causes cell death. The result is a population control circuit. They're able to generate step-response-like plots of cell growth vs. time and show that with control the cells grow to a lower steady state value. <cite>You_Nature2004</cite> --[[User:Mjdunlop|Mary]] 17:52, 14 November 2006 (EST)

* This paper uses the population control circuit from the paper above, but runs the reactions in a microfluidic bioreactor. Since they're feeding in fresh media and they can take measurements for ~8 days straight. Under the microfluidic conditions they observe oscillatory behavior from genetic circuits that maintained a constant steady state under the bulk growing conditions. <cite>Balagadde_Science2005</cite> --[[User:Mjdunlop|Mary]] 18:11, 14 November 2006 (EST)

==Possibilities==
papers that no one has read, but that might be interesting.
