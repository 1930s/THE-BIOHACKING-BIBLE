6.5 hours
=== Procedures ===
Lipofectamine 2000 method (Invitrogen) (for 1 well in 6-well cluster 10cm2, small dish of 35 mm).
# The day before transfection, pass confluent cell 1:3 in 10%FBS without Penicillin/Straptomyosin.
# Check the cell condition, if it is in 60-80% confluency, proceed, otherwise, start a new experiment.
# 1 ug DNA gently mixed into 100 ul Optimum only, gently tap the tip of vial to mix.
# 2 ul lipofectamine mixed into 100 ul Optimum only, gently tap the tip of vial to mix.
# Wait for 5 min, gently apply lipofectamine-Optimum to DNA-Optimum. Tilt and rotate the DNA tube, while adding lipo-optimum drop by drop on its wall. 
# Tap or reverse the tube gently to mix.
# Incubate in RT for 20 min for the complex formation between DNA and lipofectamine
# Apply the DNA-Lipofectamine complex Optimum to cells. Gently swirl the dish to mix. 
# Incubate 5.5 hr in incubator. check cell toxicity, if severe, stop the incubation and apply fresh 0.5% FBS-DMEM, if not, continue incubation until next day and change to 0.5%FBS DMEM.

=== Notes ===

* The optimal time interval between passing cells and transfection is 15-18 hours; and that between transfection and imaging is 36-54 hours.
