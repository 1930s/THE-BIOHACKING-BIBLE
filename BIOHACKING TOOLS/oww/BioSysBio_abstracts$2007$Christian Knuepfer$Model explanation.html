Both models describe the formation and activation of the maturation
promoting factor (MPF), a hetero dimer made of the two proteins cyclin
and cdc2. Model 1 consists of a set of ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) where each equation models the temporal evolution of the concentrations
of one of the involved substances wrt. the concentrations of
the other substances. Involved substances are: cdc2 (<math>C2</math>), phosphorylated
cdc2 (<math>CP</math>), inactive MPF (<math>pM</math>), active MPF (<math>M</math>), cyclin (<math>Y</math>), phosphorylated
cyclin (<math>YP</math>), total cdc2 (<math>CT</math>), adenosine triphosphate (<math>\sim P</math>), and
amino acids (aa). Model 2 is a mathematical abstraction of Model 1 under
certain additional biological assumptions. The <math>k_i</math> are kinetic rate coefficients.
