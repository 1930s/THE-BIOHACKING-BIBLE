Abstract:

<br>Trichoplusia ni larvae were infected with baculoviruses
containing genes for the expression of ultraviolet
optimized green fluorescent protein (GFPuv) and several
product proteins. A GFP-specific optical probe was
used to both excite the green fluorescent protein (�ex =
385 nm), and subsequently monitor fluorescence emission
(?em = 514 nm) from outside the infected larvae. The
probe’s photodetector was connected to a voltmeter,
which was used to quantify the amount of GFPuv expressed
in infected larvae. Voltage readings were significantly
higher for infected vs. uninfected larvae and, by
Western analysis, linear with the amount of GFPuv produced.
In addition, the probe sensitivity and range were
sufficient to delineate infection efficiency and recombinant
protein production for model proteins, chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase and human interleukin-2. This
work represents a critical step in developing an automated
process for the production of recombinant proteins
in insect larvae.
