==Design==

This devise is very simple and I bet it will be very robust. This is the oscillator I'm developing now for the iGEM 2008. You might notice that  BBa_I1762001 don't exist yet... this is because I intend to assemble it as the first mexican biobrick. The simulation of this will be soon.

I want LuxR to be present on the cells all the time so I in the construction it's regulated by a constitutive promoter but it seems that C0062 don't have LVA tag... the data at the registry for this biobrick is confusing but if that part actually don't have the tag I would be able to put it under the control of Cl without any problem.
