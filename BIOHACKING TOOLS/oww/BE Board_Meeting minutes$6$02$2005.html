==BE Board Budget 2005-2006==
*A 16% increase compared to 2004-2005 is proposed.  
*It is however justified because:
*#the Division is expanding
*#the BE Board offers more and more activities of increasing attendance and relevance for community building
*#the Diversity group ended up not using much of its assigned budget this past year
*#a total of four “academic seminar series” will be scheduled next year. 
*The budget proposal will be sent to Doug Lauffenburger & Dalia Gabour this week. 
 
==BE Board 2005 Elections==
*Do we want to restructure the BE Board, by having less representatives attending the meetings (rotation within each office) and an extended subcommittee structure?  Pros would include faster-paced meetings, but cons a loss of points of views for every general discussion held during meetings. 
*1 BE Diversity, 1 BE Industrial Seminars, 1 BE Community Service representative will be appointed. 
 
==BE.526 Social Hour==
*How did BE people like this new format of the weekly BE social hour? Overall, people (including a few faculty members every week) lingered around longer than at cookie hours, and more interactions were fostered. 
*The BE End of the Year Survey will address this question. 
 
==Miscellaneous==
*An academic seminar series will be instigated. 
*A BE softball/BBQ event will be scheduled. 
*IM sports: BE ranked 2nd in volleyball, 3rd in pistol, and the softball team is doing very well. 
*The GSC informs us that the City of Cambridge has agreed to a few MIT-claimed changes regarding the on-going constructions on Mass. Ave.: broader cross-walks, more lighting, one lane reserved for bikes/SafeRide buses between Vassar & Amherst Streets, etc.  The State of Massachusetts will have to corroborate this acceptation. 
*The GSC is seeking to fill a position of Graduate Representative for Community Service. 
*The GSC can allot ~ $250 for BE activities, which we may use for BE undergrad/grad events.
