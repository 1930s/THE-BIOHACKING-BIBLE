==Overview==
A procedure for drying and preserving a polyacrylamide gel.

==Materials==
*Gel drying solution
**20% ethanol
**10% glycerol
*Gel drying frames from Diversified Biotech
*Cellophane sheets from Diversified Biotech

==Procedure==
#Equilibrate gel in gel drying solution for at least 30 mins.
#*Reduces gel swelling and results in a more flexible dried gel.
#Place two cellophane sheets in water for 1-2 mins.
#*Cellophane may appear cloudy but will clear upon drying.
#Lay one sheet of cellophane on solid back plate, beveled edge down.  Avoid air bubbles.
#Place gel on cellophane.  Avoid air bubbles.
#*Air bubbles can cause cracking.
#Pipet 1-2 mLs of gel drying solution on top of gel.
#Layer a second wet sheet of cellophane on top of gel.  Match edges with edges of back plate.  Roll cellophane from bottom of gel towards the wells helps avoid air bubbles.
#Place open frame over stack, bevelled edge up.  Match edges of back plate.  Frame should cover all edges of cellophane.
#Attach plastic clips to all four sides.
#Leave assembly to dry horizontally for at least 2 days.
#Remove clips and pry apart assembly.
#Peel dried gel/cellophane sandwich from back plate.
#Trim off excess cellophane immediately to avoid curling.
