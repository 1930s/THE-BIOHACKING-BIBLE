At [http://csbi.mit.edu/icsb-2005 ICSB 2005] I discovered this great program called [http://sloppycell.sourceforge.net/ SloppyCell] written by [http://www.physics.cornell.edu/~rgutenkunst/ Ryan Gutenkunst] in the [http://www.lassp.cornell.edu/sethna/sethna.html Sethna lab] at [http://www.cornell.edu/ Cornell].  Basically, SloppyCell calculates the parameter sensitivities, but does so for identifiable parameter groups.  More details on this can be found in the [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=14525003 original publication of the algorithm].
