===Welcome to Arabidopsis lab at Texas A&M University, Biology Department===

====General lab info====

We are interested in Plant Molecular Biology, particularly phosphate physiology and the genes involved in phosphate 
metabolism in plant cells as well as in Fungi. Our model organism is Arabidopsis thaliana and here you can see some of
the protocols more commonly used when working with Arabidopsis. 

Please take a moment to review the [[general lab etiquette]] list before you start your work.
