The experiment was carried out to calibrate the response of GFP fluorescence to different concentrations of GFP, in-vitro. [GFP] and fluorescence would be expected to be directly proportional as they have a linear relation at certain concentrations.<br> 

The results obtained correlate with what was expected as the graph of fluorescence against [GFP] is a sraight line through the origin. The gradient of this graph is almost 1.5 times the gradient for GFP in-vivo, as seen in the characterisation of part F2620. This means that a particular concentration of GFP in-vitro has 1.5 times more fluorescence than the same concentration of GFP in-vivo.<br>
