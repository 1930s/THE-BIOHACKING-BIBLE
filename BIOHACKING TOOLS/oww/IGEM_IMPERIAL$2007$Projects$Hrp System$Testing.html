== Motivation ==
*The motvation behind the characterisations carried out is to create well characterised parts and devices, and to characterise in terms of; '''GFP molecules synthesized cfu <sup>-1</sup> sec<sup>-1</sup>''' .

== Dependencies ==
General tasks to be completed for each of our constructs:
# Amplifying the biobricks
# Cloning of the constructs
# Transformation
# Growing Cultures
# Fluorometer
## Measuring Inputs - GFP downstream of Promoters
## Measuring Outputs- GFP downstream of Devices
# Calibration

== General Protocols ==
=== 1. Amplifying the biobricks ===
=== 2. Cloning of the Constructs ===
[[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Projects/General Protocols#Plasmid_Preparation| Link to General Protocol]]
=== 3. Transformation ===
[[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Projects/General Protocols#Making Competent Cells| Link to General Protocol]]
=== 4. Growing Cultures ===

=== 5. Fluorometer ===

* The fluorometer used in these experiments is 'The Twinkle'.
* This machine is a plate reader fluorometer that can measure 96 well plates. 
* Using this machine it is hoped that absorbance at 600nm and the fluorescence emission of acGFP can be measured at set time intervals.
* The machine is being installed 3rd of August 10.30am.

<br>
*The general principle is to measure the fluorescence into the device and out of the device, this allows characteristics such as transfer function to be calculated.
*To enable us to measure inputs and output, two separate experiments will be carried out, one for the inputs fluorescence and one for the output of fluorescence.

*A  [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Projects/Hrp System/Testing/Protocol_Hrp| Hrp Protocol]] can be found here. This is a general protocol and can be applied to the various devices and parts to be characterised.
* Two specific fluorescence measurements will be made for each device:
# '''Input''' -The input of fluorescence will be measured at varying inducer concentrations, to give the value of '''GFP molecules synthesized cfu <sup>-1</sup> sec <sup>-1</sup>''' into our device at specific inducer concentrations.
# '''Output''' -The output of fluorescence will be measured at varying inducer concentrations and at various time intervals. The inducer concentration will have a known '''GFP molecules synthesized cfu <sup>-1</sup> sec <sup>-1</sup>''' input and so we will be measuring the time response and level of output of our device.

=== 6. Calibration ===
* The two measurements that will be made for the various devices are fluorescence emission and absorbance.
* The aim of the characterisation is to use these two measurements in order to create a more generic unit to allow for modular design and easier repetition of experiments. The unit that has been chosen to  be used is '''GFP molecules synthesised cfu <sup>-1</sup> sec<sup>-1</sup>''' .
* In order to convert our raw data into these units, two sets of calibration curves are needed.
#Absorbance
#Fluorescence
