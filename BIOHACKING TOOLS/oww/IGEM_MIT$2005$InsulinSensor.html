Authors: Notley-McRobb L, Death A, Ferenci T.]

*'''Review:'''
**Several hundred genes identified in E. coli regulated by cAMP/Crp complex (including lac and mal operons).
**cAMP synthesis by adenylyl cyclase (AC) is the major regulatory site.
**Detection of glucose levels by AC is incompletely understood but is approx. modelled as follows: in absence of glucose, members of the PTS system are normally phosphorylated, thus are continuously phosphorylating AC and driving cAMP production; in presence of glucose, members of the PTS system give up their phosphates to glucose and therefore primarily exist in nonphosphorylated forms, thus not stimulating AC and slowing cAMP production
**Glucose transport DOES NOT correlate directly with AC activation. At medium levels of glucose, cAMP was still high despite PTS system working at saturation.
**At low levels of glucose there is a second transition affecting cAMP levels, but it is different from strain to strain.
**At low glucose levels, cAMP builds up inside to high levels and therefore has to be excreted (thus the transfer function of the extracellular cAMP closely resembles that of intracellular cAMP).
**cAMP levels rise sharply when glucose levels drop to 0.3mM in minimal media (when PTS is working at 97% efficiency).

*'''Review:'''
**Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) follows different mechanisms in gram-postive and gram-negative bacteria
**Gram positive uses CcpA dependent CCR 
**Gram negative uses cAMP-CRP 
**Gram postive modulates Ccpa with HPr as signalling itermediate
**Gram negative uses EIIA-glc to activate adenyl cyclase and make cAMP.  This is dependent on the phosphorylation state of EIIA-glc
**Found homologies of CcpA signalling many proteobacteria and other types of bacteria
