! Gene !! Current Function !! Potential Re-Engineering Ideas
|-
! 1
| Assembly || It would be interesting to test how much p1, p4, and p11 depend on each other.  Is it possible to modify one gene without disrupting the function of the other two?  I would also like to vary the number of secretion channels to test whether increasing the number of channels decreases the length of the phage's life cycle.
|-
! 2
| + strand DNA replication|| Again, this gene overlaps with another gene with a different function (gene 10).  It may be useful to seperate p2 and p10 so that they can be changed independently.  Perhaps we could make + strand replication faster
|-
! 3
| phage tail protein which is initial point of infection || Increase binding affinity so that in a population of bacteria there is a higher rate of M13 infection
|-
! 4
| Assembly || Similar function to p1
|-
! 5
|  Binds ssDNA/make protein DNA complexes || Again, I see potential to decrease the phage life cycle/create greater efficiency.  Altering p5 could increase the rate of replication
|-
! 6
|  phage tail protein || This tail protein does not seem to be as necessary to the infection process as p3 so it may be a convenient location to add a GFP fusion for labelling purposes. 
|-
! 7
| phage head protein ||  If GFP fusion on p6 was not successful this is another good candidate for labeling purposes.
|-
! 8
| Phage coat protein (2700 copies)|| Currently flexible in order to adjust size to genome size. Modify rigidity in order to essentially cap genome size at desired modified size as a check on inadvertent modifications and mutations.
|-
! 9
| Blunt end of phage || Make this gene like p3...can we change side selectivity of M13?  Would M13 be able to infect using both ends?  How would this affect the virus?
|-
! 10
| + strand accumulation || Modulate from p2.  Can we increase strand accumulation in host?  How does this affect replication rate?
|-
! 11
| Assembly || Same as p1
