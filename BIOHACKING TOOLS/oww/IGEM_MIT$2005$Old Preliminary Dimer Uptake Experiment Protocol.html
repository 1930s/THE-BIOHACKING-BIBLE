===Preliminary Experiment: Uptake of Fluorescein and Fluorescein Dimers by Competent and Non-competent Bacteria===
<b>Materials</b>
*Competent cells (1.975 X 10^10 cells/ml)
*Overnight culture
*Fluorescein dimer solution: 50 and 500 micromolar (M9 + dimers)
*Fluorescein solution: 50 and 500 micromolar (M9 + fluorescein)

<b>Procedure</b>
#Prepare dimer solution by dissolving in TE buffer
#Prepare fluorescein solutions and dimer solutions (above)
#Dilute competent cells ~1:100.  (Add 24.75 mls for one eppendorf tube.)  Put on ice.
#Take OD of overnight culture.  Dilute to reach a concentration of ~3.16 X 10^8 cells/ml.
#Centrifuge competent cells and overnight culture.
#Resuspend both in fluorescein solution, fluorescein dimer solution, and M9.
#Aliquot each of 3 samples into 2 tubes.
#Centrifuge and resuspend cells for each of the three different treatments (leave 3 for "wash" control).
#Plate: dilute a portion of each of these six samples so that there will be 3000 cells/ml, then plate 100 microliters on 6 plates
#Microscope: take a 5 microliter sample and drop onto slide; look for presence of fluorescence.
