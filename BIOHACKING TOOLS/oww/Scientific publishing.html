Things to keep in mind before and while you are trying to publish. Please extend with your advice.

== Open access ==
* '''[[wikipedia:open access|Open access]]''' means not only free to read but also free to reuse under certain conditions (this will be beneficial not only for the reader but also for you - the author - when you reuse figures for presentations, reviews,..)
* Open access articles are '''read and consequently cited more often''' <small>[we need a reference here]</small>
* If open access is not an option, you may be able to publish a '''[[wikipedia:pre-print|pre-print]]''' version of your article which will be freely accessible.

== Text formatting ==
* Most journals will force you to submit a '''Word document''' :-/ Some are more progressive and allow other word processors like [[wikipedia:LaTeX|LaTeX]], [[wikipedia:OpenOffice|OpenOffice]],..
* '''Special characters''' like the Greek letters α, β,.. often cause problem when moving text between computers. Journals may require you to convert them to alpha, beta,.. [[wikipedia:unicode|Unicode]] is probably the best way to encode you text.
* The '''references''' need to be formatted according to the journal requirements. Let your bibliography software ([[wikipedia:EndNote|EndNote]], [[wikipedia:BibTeX|BibTeX]]) do the job for you. EndNote comes with many bibliography styles and additional ones can be downloaded. Many authors before you and some journals have prepared BibTeX styles which you can reuse.
* In case you are wondering how '''number of words and characters converts to pages''' in the typical print: An average two-column page with only text is about 1000 words. This is reduced by several hundred words if there are figures on the page. 1000 words is about 4000 characters without spaces counted and 5000 characters (+20%) with spaces counted. 

== Image formatting ==
* '''[[wikipedia:JPEG|JPEG]]''' gives the best compression of images of natural objects like cells, tissues, fluorescence, and EM. However, it is often not allowed since it employs a [[wikipedia:lossy compression|lossy compression]] algorithm. A [[wikipedia:Lossless JPEG|lossless JPEG]] format exists but is not widely used and therefore incompatible with some pieces of image software.
* Physical representation of images uses the concept of '''[[wikipedia:DPI|DPI]]''' (dots per inch) which is not relevant when displaying your images on screen. Most journals will require 300, 600 (typical laser printer), or even more.
* The following '''rules of thumb''' may be helpful to you when preparing figures for a two-column article:
::{|cellspacing=10
|-
|single column / half page
|8 cm
|300 DPI
|~1000 pixels <small>(945)</small>
|-
|two columns / full page
|16 cm
|300 DPI
|~2000 pixels <small>(1890)</small>
|}
