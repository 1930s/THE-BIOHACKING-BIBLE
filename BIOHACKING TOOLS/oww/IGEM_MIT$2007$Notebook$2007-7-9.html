===Nanodrop of Purified pSB3k3 from Mini-Prep of DB3.1 LC===
:1. 38.9 ng/µl
:2. 38.7 ng/µl
:3. 33.7 ng/µl
:4. 33.8 ng/µl

===Digestion of Purified pSB3k3 from this morning===
Digestion 1:
:25.6 µl pSB3k3 (38.9 ng/µl)
:0.5 µl BSA
:5.0 µl NEB3 Buffer
:1.0 µl EcoRI
:1.0 µl PstI
:16.9 µl H2O
-------------------
:50µl Total

Digestion 2:
:25.8 µl pSB3k3 (38.7 ng/µl)
:0.5  µl BSA
:5.0  µl NEB3 Buffer
:1.0  µl EcoRI
:1.0  µl PstI
:16.7 µl H2O
-------------------
:50µl Total

*Placed in 37C room at 4:30pm

===Liquid Culture of DB3.1===
Took two colonies from each plate (1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B)
*Placed in 37C room for overnight growth

===Poured Plates===
*16 LB+Amp (180µl in 450ml LB)
*28 LB+Kan (475µl in 475ml LB)

===Purification of pSB3k3, F2620 and B0034 Digestion===
pSB3k3: 3.5 ng/µl
F2620: 17.7 ng/µl
B0034: 19.9 ng/µl
*Because B0034 is under 200bp, we had to use a different kit (Qiagen Nucleotide Removal Kit)
*For pSB3k3 and F2620, we used the Qiagen PCR Purification Kit

===Ligation of F2620 and B0034 into pSB3k3===
<math>Mass_{insert}=4\frac{length_{insert}}{length_{backbone}}M_{backbone}</math>

Nanodrop of parts:
*pSB3k3----3.5 ng/ul
*B0034----19.9 ug/ul
*F2620----17.7 ug/ul

====Calculation====
<math>
\frac{50 ng}{3.5 ng/ \mu l}=14.3 \mu l</math> pSB3K3 


<math>
17.7x = 4\frac{1070}{2750}50
</math>

<math>
x=4.4\mu l </math>F2620

<math>
19.9 x = 4 \frac{17}{2750} 50
</math>

<math>
x=.062 \mu l </math> B0034

===Transformation of Ligation Results into Rana's XL1-Blue Supercompetent Cells===
====Summary====
*Ligated together backbone parts
*Transformed ligated backbone into 2 strains of competent cells
*Plated competent cells

====Expectations====
The ligation of the backbone was tricky because of the length of the B0034 RBS.  We may just need to PCR it on the end of the F2620 promoter.

The ligation was also tricky because we had very low concentrations of both our backbone and insert.  The 3.5 ng/ul could be background.

====Troubleshoot====
*Run backbone on gel
