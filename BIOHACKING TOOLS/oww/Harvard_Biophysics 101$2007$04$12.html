*As soon as is convenient for you (but before this weekend), write up and post a description of what you plan to contribute to the project.  Once you have posted your plan, please link to it from this page and include a one sentence summary. 
*Include in your description a few "deliverables" and specify whether you will complete those tasks by April 17 or April 19.
*Please post it to your own wiki page so I can keep track of what everyone is doing.
*You can consider this as some fraction of your participation & project grade.
*Hopefully you are aware of your abilities. Please post something that is non-trivial, but can realistically be completed by the specified date.
*We will be using this system of self-reporting for the remainder of the semester.  If you have unique conflicts on any given day, don't worry; your average performance will be taken into account.
*If you are at a loss for what to do, we have a [[Harvard:Biophysics_101/2007/04/10|list of things]] that need to be done and that you have indeed signed up for.
*Communicate with others who are working on similar things and ask for help if necessary
*If all else fails and you feel completely overwhelmed, we are always in need of clear documentation and project summary for outsiders.  Resmi has started on this, but it is probably not complete.  Communicate with her if you want to help.
*Let me know if you have any questions.
