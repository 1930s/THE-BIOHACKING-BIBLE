#Prepare buffers and samples
#*choose a buffer or set of buffers to use as the running and sample buffers, ideally ~2 pH units above pI of protein (if known)
#*when in doubt, start with borate buffer pH 8.0
#*concentration 20-200mM (start with 50mM)
#*salt in buffer will interfere with conductivity and separation
#*need 3 vials of each buffer (~1.5ml each) – top with orange caps
#*don't fill past the shoulder of the vial
#*samples should be approximately 50uM in a minimum volume of 50ul of sample buffer (same as running buffer)
#*not much of the sample will be injected and the majority of the sample can be recovered at the end of the experiment
#*place samples in PCR tubes in plastic vials with springs, topped with gray caps
#*also prepare water, 0.1M HCl, 0.1M NaOH, methanol, and waste vials
#*filter all samples and buffers with 0.22um filters
#*make fresh buffer aliquots for every ~10-20 runs / 2-3 weeks
#Open PACE MDQ software program - 32Karat
#*software is very similar to the HPLC software
#*instrument should already be on
#Turn on UV lamp to warm up for at least 15 min
#Make a directory for yourself in D:\Users\CE
#Sign in the log book
#Change cartridge and/or capillary if desired.
#*in software, manual control – press load to move vial trays forward
#*open tray and cartridge cover
#*unscrew the insertion bar keeping the cartridge in place and remove the cartridge
#*follow instructions in the installation and maintenance manual to change the capillary
#*reverse instructions to replace
#Place sample and buffer vials in buffer and sample trays
#*pay attention to where the tray positions for writing the methods
#*below is the standard positions for the minimum buffers needed
#*samples placed in the back sample trays can be kept at particular temperature, but can also be placed in buffer trays (only RT)
#Methods
#*use examples in D:\Users\CE\General Methods\
#*if it's the first time using the capillary ever or in several months, start with condition.met capillary to go through extensive rinsing
#*otherwise use wash.met to do a quick rinse
#*for separation methods, use bufferXaYb.met where Xa is position of rinse buffer vial and Yb is position of separation buffer vial
#*separation methods include a few washes, injection of the sample, and separatation of the sample under voltage
#*method files assume injection of buffer as the sample (baseline)
#*after all runs have been performed, use shutdown.met to give the capillary a final rinse, includes turning off the lamp
#*any of methods can be modified, including absorbance wavelenth, sample/buffer positions, length of time for separation or washes, etc, but please save in your directory's methods folder
#*to run a single method, press the blue arrow
#*save the data file in your directory's data folder
#Sequences
#*to run multiple samples, use a sequence file to specify the method, data file, and sample position of each sample
#*for examples, look in D:\Users\CE\Nora\Sequences
#*you need to name the data files by typing in the sample, including the entire path with your directory
#*press the green arrow to start the sequence
#*sequence can be modified in the later steps and saved while running
#Notes
#*if window pops that coolant is low, refill coolant
#**open bottom panel
#**connect tube attached to syringe
#**pour in coolant in 5ml increments, just let flow in
#**until level of coolant in viewing tube is between the black lines
