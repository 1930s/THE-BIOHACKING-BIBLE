==Overview==

This is a quick and easy yeast colony PCR protocol that does not require zymolyase step.

==Materials==

*Standard PCR machine, tubes
*[http://www.qiagen.com/Products/Pcr/TaqSystem/TaqDnaPolymerase.aspx Qiagen Taq Polymerase Kit with Q-solution]
*A small yeast colony
*0.02M NaOH (3uL per reaction)

==Procedure==

===Yeast Cell Lysis===
#Aliquot 3uL of 0.02M NaOH into PCR tubes.
#Using a sterile pipette tip, pick a small colony and resuspend in NaOH.
#*If the solution is cloudy, you've added enough cells.
#[optional] Quick-freeze the cells in liquid nitrogen
#*I normally skip this step.  Works just fine.
#Boil the samples on a PCR machine by incubating the tubes at 99C for 10 minutes.
#*In the mean time, prepare the master mix for the PCR reaction.
#*The boiled samples are stable at room temp for some time.  Keep on ice or freeze for longer.

===PCR===

#Prepare the master mix solution containing:
#*5uL 5X Q-solution
#*2.5uL 10X PCR Buffer
#*0.5uL dNTPs (10mM each)
#*0.5uL foward primer (100uM)
#*0.5uL reverse primer (100uM)
#*0.25uL Taq
#*12.75uL ddH2O
#Aliquot 22uL of the master mix solution to each boiled sample (25uL total reaction volume).
#Run the following PCR cycle:
##5 min at 94C
##30 cycles of:
###30 sec at 94C
###30 sec at 55C (or appropriate annealing temperature)
###1 min/kbp at 72C
##10 min at 72C

==Notes==
*Note that we use 0.5uL of 100uM primer, which is about ten-times more than standard PCR protocols.
*The PCR product can be loaded onto agarose gels directly without addition of loading buffer.
*For restriction digestion of the PCR products, use 2uL of the PCR reaction in 20uL total volume.
*The expected PCR product should be as short as possible.  Anything less than 1kbp can be easily amplified.
