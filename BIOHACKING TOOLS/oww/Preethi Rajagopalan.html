I am a post-graduate in Biochemistry from the [http://www.uni-mysore.ac.in/ University of Mysore] and have also completed my Post Graduate diploma in Bioinformatics from the [http://www.ibab.ac.in/ Institute of Bioinformatics and Applied Biotechnology (IBAB)], Bangalore. My interests include functional genomics and computational structural biology. We are currently working on mapping the metabolic pathways of ''M. tuberculosis'' and the functions of the ''M. tuberculosis'' proteome. We are also interested in the identification and analysis of possible drug targets.
