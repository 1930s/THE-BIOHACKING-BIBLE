Tell us how your part is amazing.


#Create a new wiki page: IGEM:IMPERIAL/2006/project/parts/<name_of_your_part>
#Copy and document all the different sections found below 


== SPECIFICATIONS ==

*describe the motivations behind the creation of your part.
*tell us which parameters or properties of the system you intend to explore.

== DESIGN ==

*insert an image of your designed part made of biobricks.
*insert a link to its location into the iGEM registry.
*define the inputs and outputs of the part.
*comment on the choices made to fullfill the specifications.

== MODELLING ==

*insert an image of the model you propose for your part
*define inputs and outputs.
*list all the variables and parameters of the model in a table, specifying if their values are known, unknown, to be measured.
*comment on the sensitivity of key parameters.
*comment on the different assumptions you have made when modelling.
*do you think Vincent will be happy with how simple and clear your model is ?

== IMPLEMENTATION ==

*insert an image of the construct with all the subparts available from the registry.
*if the part does not exist, describe the assembly process needed out of the available biobricks.
*estimate how long it could take to build.

== VALIDATION / TESTING ==

*describe the motivations of the testing in relation with the specifications.
*insert your proposed wetlab protocol and list in a table the material needed.
*insert expected experimental results generated by your model.
*describe how the experimental results will allow you to extract realistic values for your model.
*how many parameters of your model do you still have to borrow from the literature ?
*comment on potential issues
