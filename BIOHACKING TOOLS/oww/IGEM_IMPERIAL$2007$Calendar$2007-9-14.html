==Debriefing==
===Cell by date===
*Looking into the motivation behind the new project. Main focus is the cold chain, seems like a good application because we can define our own temp and time range to focus on. Looking into to vaccines as a possible applciation.
*There are electronic versions of ''Cell by Date'' so we will have to focus on developing countries were the finicial cost of setting these more complex systems up may be too high.
===Teaching Labs===
*The teaching lab has limited our access to equipment; major conern are water baths and incubators. Because of this, Cell by date is our major concern.

===GFP===
*GFP can be PCR out of the construct ready for purification. Need to contact Jasper.
