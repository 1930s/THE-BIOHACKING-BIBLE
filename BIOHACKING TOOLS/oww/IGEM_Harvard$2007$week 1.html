===Transformation protocol===
#Thaw the 4 tubes of cells on ice and mix gently to ensure that the cells are evenly suspended.  We will be using the following DNA:
##OMPA1 + his in PET
##OMPA1 + strep2 in PET
##OMPA2 + his in PET
##OMPA2 + strep in PET
#Add 1 µl of the DNA solution directly to the cells.  Stir gently to mix.
#Place the tubes on ice for a little more than 5 minutes
#Heat the tubes for about 45 seconds in a 42°C water bath; do not shake
#Place on ice for 2 minutes
#Add 250 µl of room temperature SOC Medium to each tube
#Shake at 37°C (300 rpm) for more than 30 minutes.
#Light the bunsen burner
#Using two sets of petri dishes containing LB agar w/ Kanamycin (1 w/ 5 µl of cells and one w/ 50 µl of cells):
##5 µl: pipette 5 µl of cells with 45 µl of SOC onto the agar mix
##50 µl: pipette 50 µl of cells onto the agar mix.
#For each plate, use sterile beads to spread the bacteria over the mix.
#Afterwards, turn the plates upside down and incubate at 37°C

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

===Nucleotide Removal===
#Add 10 volumes of Buffer PN to 1 volume of random library extensions (single primer) and mix.
#Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 ml collection tube.
#To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min at 6000 rpm.
#Discard the flow-through and place QIAquick column back into the same tube.
#To wash QIAquick column, add 750 µl of Buffer PE and centrifuge for 1 min at 6000 rpm.
#Discard the flow-through and place the QIAquick column back in the same tube, which should be empty. Centrifuge for an additional 1 min at 13,000 rpm (~17,900 x g).
#Place the QIAquick column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
#To elute DNA, add 100–200 µl of Buffer EB (10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8.5) or H2O to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min at 13,000 rpm (~17,900 x g). Alternatively, for increased DNA concentration, add 30–50 µl elution buffer to the center of the QIAquick membrane, let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge.

##OmpA1 + strep
##OmpA2 + his

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

===Measuring Optical Density to measure cell density===
#With each different kind of cell (1 or 2 with strep or his), make 6 different cultures:
##0 dilution: 1000 ul of cells w/ 0 ul LB
##2 dilution: 500 ul of cells w/ 500 ul LB
##4 dilution: 250 ul of cells w/ 750 ul LB
##8 dilution: 125 ul of cells w/ 875 ul LB
##16 dilution: 62.5 ul of cells w/ 937.5 ul LB
##LB solution: 0 ul of cells w/ 1000 ul LB
#Using the Genesis UV scanning machine, we will measure the OD of the samples to find log phase:
##Pipette culture into the clear tubes, making sure the clear sides are facing the circle.
##Insert blank (LB only), 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 16 into the machine.
##Press measure blank (should go to zero)
##Log phase is between 0.2 and 0.8 OD, so watch the absorption value until it hits these values.
###See [[IGEM:Harvard/2007/week 1/absorbance|absorbance]] page for exact values calculated by the team.
#When the bacteria enters log phase, add IPTG to the sample that needs IPTG added.
#Then we're ready to induce.

#Put caps on the eppindorf tubes to avoid having them burst as you boil them
#Boil mixture for 2 minutes
#Prepare gel:
##Remove comb and tape from gel
##rinse wells with distilled water using a syringe and needle
##To help see the gel, mark a dot at the botton of the well on the long plate side
##Pour 1X Tris Glycine running buffer to cover the gel in the middle compatment
##Pour buffer to halfway for the outer compartments
#Load gel lane 1 with 10 ul ladder
#Load gel lanes 2-9 with 20 ul of the different samples.
#Repeat gel process for the next set of mixtures.
#once the dye has run approximately 70 % of the gel's length, you can stop the process
#rinse in distilled water while continuously and gently tipping the container -- allow 10 minutes for each wash to rid of the sds
#then stain with Gelcode Blue Stain Reagent -- add enough to cover the gel submerged in the water
