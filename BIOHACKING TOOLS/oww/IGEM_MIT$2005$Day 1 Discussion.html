*What not to do?  Complicated or feasible?  Taking something to completion seems important.
*Last year's teams spent half the summer just playing around.  Would rather not do that.  Deadlines.  Let's get this working.  Intermediate steps.
*Inevitable that, since we're doing something that's never been done before, that we'll have to experiment blindly.
*If components exist that are known to work... let's use those...
*Finding Nemo thing.  Awesome (potentially complicated).  
*Will would like to explore the structural capabilities of E.coli.  Can we construct a clot of cells that is a "shape."  
*Propogate a signal in space, as opposed to moving the cells.  
*Do we want to make something that's snazzy or useful (these aren't 
**Eat plaque (could start with simpler system.  decouple the problem).
**Bacteria that can detect levels of glucose, and then produce insulin.
**Re-writing yeast chromosome
*Would like to work in yeast, what can you do in yeast.
*Degrading whatever we don't want...
**Bioremediation (eat oil)
*Battery.  Photosynthesis -> Energy
**Current Solar Cells fabrication is environmentally damaging.
**Living solar cell could have a lot of good applications.
*Chemical -> Electricity Converter
*Light driven water purification (use light to make ATP, use ATP to power segreation of ion and other pollutants in water
*Dewatering of maple syrup?
*Question.  How to connect ATP production to some effector.
*Vitamin A expression in rice.  What about mulit-vitamin rice
*Etch-a-Sketch, graphing calculator (slit, metrin, robo system from nervous system development).
*Chemical signaling between two mamallian cells.  E.g., how does a cell know to stop growing?
*Study aging.  When and how do cells talk to each other, what do they say?
