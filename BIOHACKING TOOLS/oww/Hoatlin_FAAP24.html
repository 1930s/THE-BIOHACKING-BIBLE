#Ciccia A, et al, Mol Cell. 2007 Feb 9;25(3):331-43. Identification of FAAP24, a Fanconi Anemia Core Complex Protein that Interacts with FANCM.   
**" FAAP24 shares homology with the XPF family of flap/fork endonucleases, associates with the C-terminal region of FANCM, and is a component of the FA core complex. FAAP24 is required for normal levels of FANCD2 monoubiquitylation following DNA damage. Depletion of FAAP24 by siRNA results in cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents and chromosomal instability"
