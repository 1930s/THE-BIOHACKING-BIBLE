Preparation of CaCl2 (heat-shock) competent cells<br>
<br>
Grow culture to an OD600 between 0.4 and 0.6<br>
place on ice for 15 minutes<br>
spin down cells at 4000xg<br>
resuspend gently in half volume of ice cold 50mM CaCl2<br>
Let sit on ice for 30 min<br>
spin down<br>
resuspend gently in 1/20 volume of ice cold 50mM CaCl2 + 10% glycerol<br>
<br>
incubate at least 1 hr on ice<br>
<br>
transform 200µl directly or quick freeze in a dry ice/ethanol bath and store at -80C<br>
<br>
Transformation:<br>
add 1µl plasmid and heat shock for 45 seconds at 42 degrees in a water bath<br>
