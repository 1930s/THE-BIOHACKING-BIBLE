==Culture Parts for Testing==

We will be testing the zinc hypothesis by using the part MIT used in 2004 (I13207).  This part as well as T9002 was cultured in 2 mL LB Amp overnight for testing tomorrow.  We are thinking of using 4 different tests which will tell us if having zinc in the medium makes all the difference.

*M9, no Zn, with Arabinose (Control)
*M9, with Zn, with Arabinose
*LB, with Arabinose
*LB, no Arabinose (Control)

M9 medium protocol can be found on OpenWetWare.


*Also note that to make the Amp LB for Maxi-prep (Midi-prep), go down to level one of Biochem building to the Media Office to order.  Bring 500 mL Erlynmeyer flasks and ask for:  100 mL LB with 50 ug/mL Amp.


*Ligations and part 1I have been minipreped 
*Gel is made ready to be run tomorrow


To do on Tuesday 1 August:
*30 uL digests of both 7A and 3O
*Run large gel to extract DNA fragments
**For 7A, we want the 756 bp one, NOT 2000 bp fragment
**For 3O, we want the 2091 bp one, NOT the small fragment
**Set gel at 130 V, 0.130A to run gel
**Extract fragments using transilluminator
*Ligate parts overnight
