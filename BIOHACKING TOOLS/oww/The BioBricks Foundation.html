'''The BioBricks Foundation (BBF)''' is a not-for-profit organization founded by engineers and scientists from MIT, Harvard, and UCSF with significant experience in both non-profit and commercial biotechnology research. BBF encourages the development and responsible use of technologies based on BioBrick&trade; standard DNA parts that encode basic biological functions.
<br><br>
Using BioBrick&trade; standard biological parts, a synthetic biologist or biological engineer can already, to some extent, program living organisms in the same way a computer scientist can program a computer. The DNA sequence information and other characteristics of BioBrick&trade; standard biological parts are made available to the public free of charge currently via MIT's [http://parts.mit.edu/ Registry of Standard Biological Parts].
<br><br>
Any individual or organization is welcome to design, improve, and contribute BioBrick&trade; standard biological parts to the Registry. For example, in the summer of 2007, over 600 students and instructors at 60+ universities around the world are making, sharing, and using BioBrick&trade; standard biological parts as part of the [http://parts.mit.edu/igem07/index.php/Main_Page International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM)] competition.
