==Construction of pT7-GFP==
#Picked colonies to grow in 5ml LB + Kan
#Cultures left to grow at 37&deg;C overnight
==GFP Calibration Curve==
More concentrations were carried out for the calibration curve, these give a range of concentrations tested:
*3.7uM, 1.8uM, 1.uM, 0.5uM, 0.1uM, 0.05uM, 0.025uM, 0.0125uM 
The calibration curve can be found [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Experimental Design/Phase2/Results 1.2| Here]]

== Vesicles ==
'''Formation of Vesicles'''

2160&mu;l of Solution A-CE was prepared with the following components:
* 583&mu;l of S30 cell extract (home made)
* 1080&mu;l of cell extract buffer
* 36&mu;l of rNTP solution
* 112&mu;l of Pyruvate Kinase solution
* 349&mu;l of ddH<sub>2</sub>O


360&mu;l of Solution B-CE was prepared with the following components:
* 351&mu;l of Solution A-CE
* 4&mu;l of GFP solution
* 5&mu;l of DNA solution (P<sub>tet</sub> with GFP)

The remaining 1.8ml of Solution A-CE was then diluted 10x to form 18ml of Solution A-CEd

The following 3 emulsions were prepared:
*50&mu;l of Solution B-CE into 8ml of POPC/dodecane suspension
*50&mu;l of Solution B-CE into 8ml of DOPC/dodecane suspension
*250&mu;l of Solution B-CE into 47,8ml of POPC/dodecane suspension


11 samples were created in total (note there is no Sample 9):

* '''Sample Noireaux''': Produced from the [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Projects/In-Veso/Implementation/Protocol1.3 | Noireaux protocol]]. Solution B-CE was added to 200&mu;l taken from the 50ml POPC/dodecane suspension prepared [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Notebook/2007-9-3 | the day before]].
* '''Sample 1''': 2ml from the 10ml POPC/dodecane suspension was used to prepare the interface over 3ml of Solution A-CEd. 1ml of emulsion was added 2 hours later, centrifuged at 120x g, and collected.
* '''Sample 2''': 2ml from the 10ml DOPC/dodecane suspension was used to prepare the interface over 3ml of Solution A-CEd. 1ml of emulsion was added 2 hours later, centrifuged at 120x g, and collected.
* '''Sample 3''': Prepared [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Notebook/2007-9-3 | the day before]] and left overnight before being collected. Sample not centrifuged.
* '''Sample 4''': Prepared [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Notebook/2007-9-3 | the day before]] and left overnight before being collected. Sample not centrifuged.
* '''Sample 5''': 2ml from the 50ml POPC/dodecane suspension was used to prepare the interface over 3ml of Solution A-CEd. 1ml of emulsion was added 2 hours later, centrifuged at 120x g, and collected.
* '''Sample 6''': 2ml from the 10ml POPC/dodecane emulsion was poured over 3ml of Solution A-CEd (with no prepared interface), and left to rest for 2 hours, before being centrifuged at 120x g for 10 minutes and collected.
* '''Sample 7''': 2ml from the 10ml DOPC/dodecane emulsion was poured over 3ml of Solution A-CEd (with no prepared interface), and left to rest for 2 hours, before being centrifuged at 120x g for 10 minutes and collected.
* '''Sample 8''': 2ml from the 50ml POPC/dodecane emulsion was poured over 3ml of Solution A-CEd (with no prepared interface), and left to rest for 2 hours, before being centrifuged at 120x g for 10 minutes and collected.
* '''Sample 10''': 2ml from the 10ml POPC/dodecane emulsion recycled from [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Notebook/2007-9-3 | the day before]] was left stirring overnight, and then was poured over 3ml of Solution A (with no prepared interface). It was left to rest for 2 hours before being centrifuged at 120x g for 10 minutes and collected.
* '''Sample 11''': 2ml from the 10ml DOPC/dodecane emulsion recycled from [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Notebook/2007-9-3 | the day before]] was left stirring overnight, and then was poured over 3ml of Solution A (with no prepared interface). It was left to rest for 2 hours before being centrifuged at 120x g for 10 minutes and collected.

Samples 1-11 were produced using [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Projects/In-Veso/Implementation/Protocol1.2 | protocol 1.2]].

Samples 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8 were prepared from an interface formed on top of 3ml of Solution A-CEd (see above).




'''Results''' <br>

All 11 samples prepared today were scrutinised under the microscope. Here are the results (scroll down to the bottom for images.):

* '''Sample Noireaux''': No vesicles were found. There were ''lots'' of GFP aggregates.
* '''Sample 1''': Plenty of vesicles were found, but with very weak fluorescence inside. There were ''lots'' of GFP aggregates.
* '''Sample 2''': No vesicles were found, but one large fluorescent blob was present. There were ''lots'' of GFP aggregates. A strange, unidentified texture of objects was found.
* '''Sample 3''': One possible vesicle or blob found, with no fluorescence inside. E.coli contamination. Strange vesicle coalescence around a large GFP aggregate (vesicles faintly fluorescent).
* '''Sample 4''': Lots of coalescence, with faint fluorescence inside.
* '''Sample 5''': Flocculated vesicles, with very faint fluorescence inside.
* '''Sample 6''': Well formed vesicles, and some coalescence, with faint and not-so-faint fluorescence inside.
* '''Sample 7''': Rare but well formed vesicles, with faint fluorescence inside.
* '''Sample 8''': Best results. High count of well formed vesicles, with not-so-faint fluorescence inside.
* '''Sample 10''': Single large coalesced blob, with faint fluorescence, in spite of dense aggregate. No external aggregates.
* '''Sample 11''': Many 2&mu;m fluorescent vesicles, with very good enclosure - very few external aggregates. Large group of coalescence blobs.
