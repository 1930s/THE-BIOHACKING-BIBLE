# Does dimerization initiate a signal?

#<b>Does dimerization initiate a signal</b>
#*Requires testing of ToxR::PhoA and ToxR::MalE, with ctx promoter::actuator. 

==Receiver 1 w/ Receiver Head Unit==
====Questions====
# Is the fusion complex being expressed?
# Is the protein where we want it to be?
# If we make fusion to ToxR, can scFV bind to fluorecein?
# Will the binding of a fluorescein dimer initiate dimerization? 

====Experiments====

#<b>Expression of Fusion Complex</b>
#*Test for tags that surround scFv sequence
#**Flag tag on 3' end of scFv
#**Use antibodies that recognize those tags; Western, indirect immunofluorescence, permiabilize 
#<b>Location of Fusion Complex: </b>Is it being expressed in correct location (across innermembrane)
#*Look at cells insitu (microscope), Direct immunofluor.
#*<u>Fractionate</u> cytoplasmic vs. membrane fractions of cells.
#*Controls
#**(-) only ToxR
#**(-) scFv without tag (we need different primers!)
#**(+) protein that has flag tag known expressed  (need!)
#<b>Fluorecein Binding to scFv fusion</b>
#*Fluorescein: When bound to scFv, it does not fluoresce. Cannot test directly. But can lyse cells to get yes/no answer.
#*Controls
#**(-) scFv that does not bind fluorecein
#**(+) scFv that binds fluorecein
#***Add fluorecein, Wash cells to remove unbound fluorecein, (+) Should have fluorecein bound to it (-) should not.
#***Detect fluorecein (quantitive!)
#****(?) Western with antifluorecein rabbit antibody, secondary antibody goat antirabbit (enzyme)
#****(?) Pull-down: mix AB with cell solution so that AB attaches to cell, spin down.
#****(?) Reverse treatment so that scFv release fluorecein. 
#<b>Does fluorescein dimer initiate dimerization</b>
#*Can we separate out dimerization from signal generation?
