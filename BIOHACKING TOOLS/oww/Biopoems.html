Welcome to the BioPOETS Wiki!  For information about our group and our current research projects, visit our <b>[http://biopoems.berkeley.edu Lab Website]</b>.  This wiki is intended as a repository for lab policies, equipment manuals, and experimental procedures.  We hope that this information will benifit not only our lab members but also the greater bioengineering community.

New website is up and all the content that was on the Wiki is now there.  The old Wiki pages are still around though, so if I forgot something, we can still get to it.
