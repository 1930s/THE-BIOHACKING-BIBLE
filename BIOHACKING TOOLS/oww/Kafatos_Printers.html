===Consumables===

Please please please: replace toner when needed (shake and replace first - sometimes this gets another 1000 pages!) - and '''put the old cartridge and box on Bob or Yasmeen's desk''' so that we can re-order well before your next major deadline.

===Mac instructions for setting up ls-fckprn1.saf.ic.ac.uk===

===Windows instructions for setting up ls-fckprn1.saf.ic.ac.uk===

Following Windows logic, you must add your network printer as a "local
printer" and then jump through several hoops before you get the thing
configured.

After it has failed to find a plug and play printer, click next
until you get to "create a new port" -> "Standard TCP/IP"

After that, paste in ls-fckprn1.saf.ic.ac.uk

When you get to choosing drivers, note that there is a generic
"HP LaserJet" driver that you can use.
You do not need to share your printer.

It should work...  please don't all print a test-page!
