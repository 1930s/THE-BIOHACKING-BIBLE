Intermolecular interactions, especially hydrogen bonds, manifest
themselves in somewhat similar ways both in crystals of small organic
molecules and large biological macromolecules. We are trying to analyse
crystal structures of biological macromolecules with respect to
intermolecular interactions and to establish some general principles
for their assembly using ideas and concepts of crystal engineering. The
possible application of such a study is in the field of drug design.
Where drug design is concerned, an overall knowledge is vital to obtain
safer drugs. Especially, with the current importance of virtual
screening, there is an urgent need to develop methods to efficiently
study the chemical space of drug molecules. Our research aims at
understanding the overall chemical nature of drug molecules through the
study of databases of small molecules (drugs and non-drugs). In this
respect there is a continuing effort in our group to develop methods
for analysing drug-like and non-drug molecules. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Traditionally drug
design has relied more on serendipity than on rational design,
especially in the early stages of lead molecule identification. But
recent developments in the field of genomics and proteomics have forced
the researcher to adopt more rational approaches to drug design to
convert the huge amount of raw data into medicinally important
information. We follow a dual strategy using both analog and structure
based drug design based on the type of information available. In the
analog based approach we use 3D-QSAR, pharmacophore generation and de
novo design methods. On the other hand the structure based methods
include molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to
understand the basic nature of drug-receptor interactions. When the
target structure is not known we try to model it through a
computational approach (see illustration)
      Rational drug design with a flavour of strong and weak intermolecular interactions is being applied to design novel inhibitors targeting diseases like
tuberculosis and cancer. &nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>

Softwares : Hydrogen Bond Analysis Tool (HBAT) http://openwetware.org/images/6/61/HBAT.gif <br>
Discription :- HBAT is a tool to automate the analysis of strong and weak hydrogen bonds present in a PDB file. This tool can be implemented in active site interaction analysis, structure based drug design and molecular dynamics simulations. HBAT is written using PERL and TK languages. It is a user-friendly desktop tool, which offers the user freedom to select several parameters. The program generates an MSOFFICE Excel compatible output file for statistical analysis, provides distance-angle distributions across various geometry ranges while tabulation of frequencies for each residue, ligand, water, and also nucleic acids can be done easily for any kind of interaction. Cooperativity in hydrogen bond geometry can also be studied in a defined region of structure.
