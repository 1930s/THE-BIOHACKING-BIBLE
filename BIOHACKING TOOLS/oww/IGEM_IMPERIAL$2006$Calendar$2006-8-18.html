==2pm Meeting with Dr. Danny O'Hare on the Biosensor==

Discussed issues relevant for the biosensor: 
*Need to work out the pH range for our AHL concentrations - we can't just assume that the concentration of hydrogen ions is going to be the same as the AHL concentrations (-> need to find pKa of our acid)
*Can contact him again for any pH sensors
*We can contact Suket Singhal for further information about enzyme-coated ISFETs 
*Should contact ABC to find out whether we can use HPLC in order to assess AHL concentrations
