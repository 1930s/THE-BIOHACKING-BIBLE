Abstract

<p>An all-solid-state green fluorescent protein
(GFP) sensor for GFP measurement was developed. It is
immune to interference from ambient light and works
with standard flow-through cuvettes. The sensor is practically
insensitive to the scattered excitation light encountered
in microbial suspensions. It has a range of
0.0002–1 g/L (7.4 × 10−9 – 3.7 × 10−5 M) with limit of
detection 0.00019 g/L (7.0 × 10−9 M). The sensor could be
used with a UV or blue light emitting diode (LED) as a
light source, depending on required sensitivity, selectivity,
and background levels. Its very low cost makes it
useful in a variety of applications. This article describes
the construction and validation of the sensor both off and
on-line in fermentation processes. © 2000 John Wiley
