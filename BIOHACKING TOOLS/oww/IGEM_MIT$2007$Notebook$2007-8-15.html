==Making electrocompetent BL-21 Cells==
Eh, not particularly fast compared to chemically competent cell if you cut the incubation on ice to 10 minutes.

Thank you, Barry, for letting us use your stash of BL-21s.

==Made a 5mL LC of BL-21 so we can make our own competent cells and not bother Barry anymore==

==All the things transformed and/or plated today==
All plasmids transformed into competent BL-21s

F2620.B0034                  1AC3              8/14 ligation strip, #7       1 Cm; 1 Kan (control for insert re-ligation)

F2620.B0034                  3K3               8/14 ligation strip, #8       1 Cm (control for correctness of ligation experiment); 1 Kan
    note: (- control) no vector         

F2620.B0034.CPX              1AC3              glycerol stock                1 Cm

F2620.B0034.CPX#6-1.B0014    1AC3              miniprep, B-R 6-1             1 Cm     
    note: this plasmid is pick #1 of 6 minipreps and is derived from the colony PCR #6 line of F.B34.C plasmids.
          this pick was chosen because this plasmid had the clearest sequencing signals of the 6 minipreps.

F2620.B0034.CPX#8-5.B0014    1AC3              miniprep, B-R 6-5             1 Cm
    note: plasmid is pick 5 of 6, F.B34.C comes from cPCR #8.
          this pick was chosen because of its clear sequencing results.

I14023.B0034.CPS.B0014       1AC3              8/14 lig. strip, #5           1 Cm; 1 Kan (control for insert re-ligation)

I14032.B0034.CPX.B0014       1AC3              8/14 lig. strip, #2           1 Cm; 1 Kan (control for correctness of experiment)
    note: (- control) vector only, no inserts

I14032.B0034.CPX.B0014       3K3               8/14 lig. strip, #3           1 Cm (control for correctness of experiment); 1 Kan
    note: (- control) CPX.B0014 insert only, no vector or I.B34

I14032.B0034.CPX.B0014      2K3                8/14 lig. strip, #4           1 Cm (control for correctness of experiment); 1 Kan
    note: (- control) I14032.B0034 insert only, no vector or C.B14

==Mercury Removal Assay Protocol==
* Derived from Bae et al. Papers
# Grow to OD of .3 in LB + Amp
# Induce with 1mM IPTG
# Induce for 2,3,4,5 hrs
# Grow to OD of 1.0
# Suspend in LB medium w/ 5uM Hg2+
# Check [Hg2+] after 1 hr
