==Goals for the meeting==
Plan logistics for setting up a custom writing class for second year BMB graduate students for Winter term



==Class Description from Vollum Website==

This course is an in-depth professional science writing course open to all OHSU researchers. The writing program has two main elements: the weekly two-hour seminar and the weekly individual tutorial. 
 
The seminar is designed on the model of the writing workshop, in which participants bring writing to class each week and the class discusses strategies and options for revising. The workshop is an efficient way to improve writing because it helps you to understand how your writing is coming across to an audience who ought to be able to understand your work: your colleagues. This workshop also helps you develop a vocabulary that you can use to assess writing, which will help you become a more attentive and responsive reader, peer reviewer, teacher, and colleague. We will cover basic elements of good scientific writing style, including document, paragraph, and sentence structure, as well as answer nagging questions about grammar, punctuation, and usage. 
 
The tutorials are held once a week, for about an hour. Here, we will work intensively on whatever skills or problems you would like to address by going over the professional writing you are working on. 
 
Objectives:
*To help you write-and therefore think-more clearly
*To improve formal science writing abilities (grammar, style, punctuation)
*To improve logic, structure, and rhetoric
*To learn to target different audiences
*To learn constraints of writing and how to overcome them
*To receive individualized coaching for manuscripts, grants, job applications, and other professional writing projects
*To improve your ability to read and edit the work of others

Audience: Researchers, Neuroscience Graduate Program students, other graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, faculty
Dates & Times: This course is offered three times per year: Winter, Spring, Fall; 9.30 am-11.30 am Wednesdays, with additional tutorial times by appointment
Duration: 8 weeks
Location: Vollum 4M

**Best fit is summer of 2nd year to help with quals
**Advisor/student/Rachel will decide on appropriate practical example to work on. 

*Problems considered
**Is this too much help for students? Discussion was that helping the students with writing structure is better for the students and that weaknesses will still be identified 

*Action Items
**Rachel will email article on scientific writing, book titles on scientific presentation. [[User:Hoatlinm|Maureen]] 13:35, 21 December 2006 (EST)  done
Will consider sitting in on Adv class to help with evaluation of presentations
**Rachel needs to figure out about how assign credit w/ C. Cunninham
