==Scott-Simanis Protocol==
For making chemically competent ''E. coli''
===Materials===
*[[Oneill_Lab:Media#&psi;b|&psi;b]]
*&psi;a plates
**&psi;a is made by adding agar to &psi;b liquid media to a concentration of 1.5% (w/v) and autoclaving
*[[Oneill_Lab:Media#TFBI|TFBI]]
*[[Oneill_Lab:Media#TFBII|TFBII]]

===Procedure===
#Streak frozen stock of cells on &psi;a plate
#Incubate overnight at 37&deg;C
#Pick a single colony and inoculate 5ml of &psi;b
#Incubate at 37&deg;C overnight
#Subculture 5ml into 100ml of &psi;b
#Grow for about 2 hours, until OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.5
#Chill cells on ice for 5 minutes
#Pellet cells at 4000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4&deg;C
#Decant media and resuspend cells in 2/5 volume of TFBI
#Chill cells on ice for 5 minutes
#Pellet cells at 4000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4&deg;C
#Decant media and resuspend cells in 1/25 volume of TFBII
#Aliquot cells and snap freeze
#*Store at -80&deg;C
