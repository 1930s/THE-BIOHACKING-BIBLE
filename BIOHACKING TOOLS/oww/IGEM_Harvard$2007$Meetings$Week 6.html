<u>S.Lo's Notes</u>
*Quorum
**Switch fluorophores on constructs
**Actually do dilution/extinction for fluorescence ...
**Make graphs without normalizing for autofluorescence?
**Keep fluorescence in one assay, run OD in parallel (unfortunate, but probably more accurate)
**Make graphs with controls / noninduced
**Watch RFP carefully ... try to 'bridge' these past experiments ... keep some controls/things constant
**Alain - be careful about such long Vacufuges ...
*Fec
**Use Quorum constructs for positive control (the ~3000 RFU) to see full range
***In a way, this also calibrates all our experiments
**Use E0240 (not that sketchy, apparently) for GFP fluorescence next ligation
**PennState working on pdz and nickel domains
*MACS
**AIDA-1 construct: MACS turned out well, about 200 colonies (versus 5 RFP colonies); assay worked well
**Use AIDA to construct libraries
**FACS results
***Still haven't grown that well
**Compatible with standard biobrick restriction sites
**Have varied amount of antibody added (except for AIDA - exact protocol, except addition of 10 minutes to incubation, about 5uL of extra antibody each, repeat of second wash step ... first time worked; this protocol is promising then)
*Sammy
**Recieved Primers for 2-step PCR
***Have two products: first part of OmpA, second part: BB cutting site, strep and his at beginning as positive control, or random 10mer or 15mer (haven't gotten the randomers yet)
**PCR for strep and his = good results
**Cut first product with Spe1 and second with Xba, ligate
***Ligation yielded low DNA concentrations this past weekend
***Instead, have transformation inside protocol to increase DNA product
**Looked at diversity - 15 and 10mers looked similar, compared through sequencing and BLAST - not much diversity?
***Mike - the design of primers - accidental match to end of OmpA; two Biobrick sites flanking randomer site ... actually chopping randomer before ligation
****Need to redesign primers (and more double-checking before ordering of primers)
*Target?
**Alain suggests Calmodulin - already known binding sites; works only in presence of calcium; already have beads; well-characterized, structure known - seems like the perfect protein - believes we have antibodies, all that we need except library
*Alex
**Used different ligation strategy
**Every step - addition of ethanol and things ... extractions ... keep volume down and DNA concentrated?
**Transformation - results from chemically competent cells about same as before (30 colonies per plate)
**OneStep Electrocompetent cells (from freezer) gave only 2 colonies
**Arsenic-sensitive promoters
***Split normal Fec promoter into 2 different FecI (sigma factor)
***Use directed mutagenesis to knock binding affinity
