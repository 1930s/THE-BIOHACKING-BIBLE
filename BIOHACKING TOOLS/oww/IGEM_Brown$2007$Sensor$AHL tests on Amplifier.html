Here are Imperial's results for the part.

Imperial's results say that '''the amplifier works'''.

''''In LB''', it resulted in an increase from 9k RFU to 13k RFU. This is an increase of about 50% fluorescence, over the baseline value from T9002, the AHL biosensor.

'''In M9''', AHL addition increased by 100%, from 2000 to 4000 RFU. The baseline value of 2000 was from the T9002 AHL biosensor.

'''Do we need amplification at all? Amplification of several magnitudes would be significant, but just doubling the RFU doesn't seem that hot. On the other hand, do we need a better amplifier?'''

This is a graph of GFP flourescence (y axis) by AHL concentration (X axis) at different time points (different colored lines).
Each one was done twice. The AHL concentrations were 0, 10^-13 M, 10^-11 M, 10^-9 M, 10^-7 M, 10^-5 M, and 10^-4 M.
Flourescence on the y axis was measured by taking the RFUs from the flourimeter (Abs514) and dividing by cell density (OD600) on the spectrophotometer.
