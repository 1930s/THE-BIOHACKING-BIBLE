Although DNA is generally viewed as a stable molecule, many conditions can cause loss of DNA bases or strand breakage.

==Depurination==

* Depurination involves the loss of purine bases forming abasic sites
* Depurination is one of the two limiting factors in chemical synthesis of long DNA oligos (the other is coupling efficiency)
* DNA under physiological conditions has been estimated to depurinate at a rate of <math>3\cdot 10^{-11}</math>/sec at 37C and pH 7.4 <cite>lindahl72</cite>
* Heating DNA for 10m@100 at pH 7.0 leads to about 1 apurinic site per 1000 base pairs
* The activation energy of depurination is around 29 kcal/mol
* Higher temperatures lead to faster depurination
* Denatured DNA depurinates at about 4 times the rate of dsDNA @ pH 7.4
* Methylated As (6-methyladenine) found in bacteria are depurinated 4 times faster than the unmethylated purine bases
* Depurination decreases at higher pH (thus acidic conditions favor depurination)
* Depurination proceeds more rapidly in buffers of low ionic strength
* Depurination is correlated with lower transformation efficiency
* Depurination is independent of sequence

==Deamination==

* Cytosine can be spontaneously deaminated to form uracil.
* Cytosine in native DNA is estimated to deanimate with a rate constant of <math>7\cdot 10^{-13}</math>/sec at 37C and <math>10^{-10}</math>/sec at 70C
* Single stranded DNA deaminates significantly faster (> 100 times) than double stranded DNA
* Mispaired Cs (C:C and T:C) are 1-2 orders of magnitude more likely to deaminate than in double stranded DNA (similar to single stranded DNA)
* The rate of deamination of C mispairs is around <math>(8-40)\cdot 10^{-10}</math>/sec at 60C and about <math>(4-13)\cdot 10^{-10}</math>/sec at 37C

==Strand cleavage==

* Under physiological conditions (pH 7.4, ionic strength of 150mM with 10mM Mg++ ions), the lifetime of a phosphodiester bond at an abasic site is 190 hours @ 37C <cite>lindahl72b</cite>
* Abasic sites are alkali-labile. Under mildly alkaline conditions, &beta;-elimination occurs which nicks 3' to the abasic site leaving a 5'-P on the downstream fragment
* Under strong alkaline conditions, &delta;-elimination will occur after &beta;-elimination which completely removes the abasic site leaving a 3'-P on the upstream fragment and a 5'-P on the downstream fragment
* Amines (such as amino acids or polyamines like putrescine, spermidiine, and spermine) greatly increase the rate of strand breakage at abasic sites
