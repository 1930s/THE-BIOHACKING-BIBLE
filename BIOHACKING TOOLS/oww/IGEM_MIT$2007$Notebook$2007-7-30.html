==Mer-GFP Expression Protocol==
# Mix Diluted LB Media (LB4.10)
##4g NaCl, .5g Yeast Exract, 1g Tryptone + 1L H20 
# Autoclave LB4.10
# Grow up 10 mls ON at 30°C
# Dilute back 1:100 in fresh LB4.10 (50 ul to 5 ml)
# Add HgCl2 in following concentrations (ng/ml):
##0
##5
##10
##25
##50
##75
##100
##150
##300
##500
##1000
##10000
# Grow at 30°C for 16h
# Wash a 3ml sample of each (twice) and resuspend in .9% NaCl (Minimizes Background)
# Measure flourescence 
* Excitation wavelength - 395nm
* Emission wavelength - 509nm

Measure out 0.1 g and dilute in 10 mL water
This will give you 10 mL of 10 mg/mL
Take 100 uL and dilute in 10 mL water
This will give you 10 mL of 100 ug/mL
Take 100 ul and dilute in 10 mL water
This will give you 10 mL of 1 ug/mL

==Live Cell Immunoassay (Eric)==
*Today's assay - fluorescent staining of T7 tag engineered into the CPX insert.  Checks for expression of CPX and polystyrene-binding peptide
#Induce cells with current conditions
#Spin down 1 OD cells
#Resuspend in 1 mL PBS-BSA (5 mg/mL) -- make 50 mL
#Spin down 0.2 OD (200 µl); aspirate off media
#Resuspend in 100 µl 1:500 (experiment?) antiT7 antibody in PBS-BSA (1 mL PBS-BSA; 2 µl antiT7)
#Incubate on ice for 30 minutes
#Add 800 µl cold PBS-BSA
#Spin down cells and remove media
#Resuspend in 100 µl 1:20 anti-mouse antibody in PBS-BSA (1 mL PBS-BSA; 50 µl anti-mouse)
#Incubate on ice for 30 minutes IN THE DARK
#Repeat Step 7
#Repeat Step 8
#Repeat Steps 7 and 8; wash
#Resuspend in 100 µl PBS-BSA
#Look under fluorescent microscope
*Do induced + controls
