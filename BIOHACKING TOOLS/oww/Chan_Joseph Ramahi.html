Hello and welcome to Joe Ramahi's page.
<br>

<br>
Joe is a second year graduate student from the Cell and Developmental Biology Graduate Group. 
Several of Joe's projects involve the use of live imaging using the MCB department's deconvolution microscope as a way of testing centromere function by observing chromosome dynamics ''in vivo''. We are interested in what epigenetic modifications are important for proper centromere structure and function.
Some of our fluorescently tagged markers include: Htr12-GFP for labeling centromeres, H2B-CFP for labeling whole chromosomes, and we are currently creating fluorescently labeled tubulin and cohesin for live imaging analysis. More research interests coming soon!

Joe did his undergraduate research in the lab of Dr. Laura Burrus at San Francisco State University. While in the Burrus Lab, he worked on Wnt signaling in chick neural tube development using antisense gene knockdown and confocal microscopy. Joe was funded by the SFSU MARC program.<br>
Here at Davis, Joe is also a member of the Designated Emphasis in Biotechnology, and is currently on the NIH training grant in Biomolecular Technology. He also does undergraduate recruitment for the office of Graduate Studies.<br>
