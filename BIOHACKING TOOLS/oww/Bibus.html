== What is Bibus ?==
Bibus is a bibliographic and reference management software. As with other such tools, Bibus allows one to search, edit, and sort bibliographic records. In addition, Bibus contains features that makes it unique among open source and even commercial bibliographic databases: 
*Hierarchical organization of the references with user defined keys 
*Designed for multiuser environments
**You can share the database between an "unlimited" number of users 
**Each user will have its own classification 
**You can define read-only and read-write users 
*Live queries; that is searches that update as the database changes 
*On-line [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed PubMed] queries 
*On-line [http://invention.swmed.edu/etblast/index.shtml eTBLAST] queries 
*Insertion of references and formatting of bibliographies into two widely used Word Processors ([http://www.openoffice.org OpenOffice.org] and [http://www.microsoft.com/france/office/word/prodinfo/ Microsoft Word]) 
*Foreign language support through Unicode and gettext. As of version 1.2, Bibus is available in English, French, Portuguese, German, Spanish and Chinese. 
*Bibus works on most modern platforms: 
**Gnu/linux with [http://www.openoffice.org OpenOffice.org]
**Windows98/2000/XP with [http://www.openoffice.org OpenOffice.org] and [http://www.microsoft.com/france/office/word/prodinfo/ Microsoft Word] 
**On other platforms (MacOS X, ...) Bibus works with Microsoft Word but styles cannot be created at this point (this should change soon for MacOS X)
