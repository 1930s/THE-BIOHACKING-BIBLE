== Abstract ==

[[Wikipedia:Runx2|''runx2'']] has been suggested to play a major role in osteogenesis. Multiple research cite on its implication in the differentiation of the biopotential precursor cell to osteoblast. Some evidence hint its role also in controlling the differentiation from multipotential mesenchymal cell to biopotential precursor cell as well. Haploinsufficiency of ''runx2'' was shown to cause [[Wikipedia:Cleidocranial_dysostosis|Cleidocranial dysostosis]], and ''runx2'' knock-out mouse exhibit complete loss of bone formation.


Promoter analysis within a limited region of ''runx2'' was insufficient in explaining the spatiotemporal expression pattern. A recent method based on conservation of non-coding elements [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=16556802&query_hl=1&itool=pubmed_docsum] was applied to search for novel functional regulatory (enhancer) elements.
