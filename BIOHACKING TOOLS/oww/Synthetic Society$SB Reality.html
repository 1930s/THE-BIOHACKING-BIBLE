<br>
Characteristics as of 1 February 2006:
*Cost. ~$1 per bp
*Length. ~100 bp direct chemical synthesis, ~15,000 bp PCR assembly, ~3,500,000 bp inchworm elongation
*Error Rate.  From 1:10 to effectively zero
*Time.  6 hours for 100 bp, 2-6 weeks for 15,000 bp, ~2 months for 50,000 bp, ~7 years for 3,500,000 bp
*Diversity. From one molecule to millions of molecules (heavily dependent on method)
*Terms of Sale. Varied (from no-strings-attached to full-rights-reserved).

I just spoke with <person> about getting copies of the entire <deleted> series.  I explicitly told her I work for you (she asked in what capacity).  She did ask why we wanted them and I told her to test them out with some of our constructs to see how useful they are.  She is going to send me a sample MTA agreement (via e-mail) by the end of the week.  She warned me of the following:<br>
<br>
1) They require signature of an MTA before release of the strains (which we knew already).<br>
2) We must provide them with a detailed experimental plan specifying how we plan to use the strains.<br>
3) The strains cannot leave our lab.<br>
4) They request that we share any results that we obtain using the strain(s).<br>
5) No changes can be made to the chromosome of any of the strains.<br>
6) There is a small transfer fee associated with obtaining the strains (she said she would have to speak with <person> to determine what the exact amount is).<br>
I'll forward the MTA on when I receive it.  Do you still want to proceed with this, knowing the above?<br>

Hi Drew - Are you ok with me asking the fellow in Germany who developed the
[reverse] Tet system that the van Oudenaarden lab is using for an MTA ?<br>
thanks, Alex. <br>

Dear Dr. Endy,<br>
My name is <grad student at UCLA>. I am a graduate student in <some lab> at UCLA. I am attempting to construct a gene circuit using the tetR repressor for a metabolic engineering project and I was wondering if it would be possible to obtain your plasmid pSB1A2 containing part BBa_C0040 (a degradable form of the tetR repressor) from the BioBricks project. Thank you for your assistance.<br>
Sincerely, <graduate student at UCLA><br>

Hi <student>,<br>
Just a follow-up to your email. Hopefully Meagan has been in touch with you already (below).  But, FYI, request received and should be arriving shortly / arrived.  <br>
