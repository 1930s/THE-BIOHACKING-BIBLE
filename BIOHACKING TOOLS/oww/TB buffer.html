==Uses==
TB buffer is used to make chemically competent cells by the Inoue method [[Preparing chemically competent cells (Inoue)]]

==Materials==
* PIPES buffer 0.5M solution pH 6.7  (sterilized, made with milli-Q pure H2O, store at -20C)
* Manganese chloride tetrahydrate
* Calcium chloride dihydrate
* Potassium chloride
* Potassium hydroxide 1M solution
* Sterile 0.22 &mu;m bottle top filter
* vacuum source
* clean glassware (no detergent residue -- clean with 70% EtOH)

==Preparation==
For a 1 liter solution add:
* 250 mM potassium chloride (18.65 g)
* 15 mM calcium chloride (2.2 g)
* 10 mM PIPES (20 ml of an 0.5 M solution)

to 800 ml of DI water.  Adjust pH to 6.7 with 1M KOH.

Dissolve 
* 55 mM manganese chloride (10.88 g)

in 100 ml of DI water, add gradually to the solution of the remaining components.  Bring solution to 1 liter.  The pH of the solution will fall, which is expected.
* Do not attempt to adjust the pH.  Adding base after adding manganese will precipitate a yellow/brown hydroxide.

Sterile filter with a pre-washed 0.22 &mu;m filter and store indefinitely at 4 degrees.
