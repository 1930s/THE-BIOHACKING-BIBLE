I am a first year graduate student in the Systems Biology Program.

Currently I am a "Schr√∂dinger's cat" in the black box... if the radioactive atom decays within one hour, I will be a mathematician.  If not, I will be a biologist.  Now could you tell what state I am in after an hour before you open the black box?'''
