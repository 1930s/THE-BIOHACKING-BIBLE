==To Do==
*Redo E0240 PCR w/ vent and phusion
*Ligate, transform T9002 and 3k3
*Remake overnight cultures of I2056

==E0240==
*Redid 2 100ul prep pcr's with Vent and Phusion
*Just realized that we completely skipped the ligation and transformation with backbone
*Discarded PCR product
*Did two way ligations E0240-3K3 and E0240-1AK3 (used 4.5ul of each E0240 and backbone)
*Transformed 3 ul of each ligation and plated

==T9002==
*Ligated T9002-D and T9002-S with 3K3 (Double and Sequentially digested)
*Transformed using 3ul of ligation
*Plated on Kan plates

==I2055==
*Got sequencing back and all samples do not contain R0040
*Religated R0040-I13401-1AK3, R-I-1AT3, R-I-1AC3 (3ul each part)
*Transformed 3 ul of each ligation and plated
*Primer to PCR in R0040 came in
*Doing a 100ul prep PCR of the #4 colony of I2055 on 1AK3
*Using Vent at 53C (1:30 extension time)

From now on should use Vent for all Preparatory PCR reactions

==I2056==
*Overnight liquid cultures did not grow
*Made new overnights from actual colony instead of cell suspension
