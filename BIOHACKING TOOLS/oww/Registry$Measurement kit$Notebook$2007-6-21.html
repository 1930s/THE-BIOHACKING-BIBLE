=="Scarring" PCR==
*Began PCR to remove BioBrick restriction sites from T9002 and E0240

==Sequencing of I2055==
*2µL of 1.6µM primers
*needed 200-500 ng of DNA, or about 1µL
*add water to 12µL.
*tube 1: forward primers; tube 2: reverse

==RFP-based device construction==
*started digests of backbones 1AK3, 1AT3, 1AC3, and parts B0032, R0040, and J04650
