===Result of The Potency Test of Competent Cells Made Yesterday===
*Plates with 100uL transformants: 5000~6000 (number of positive colonies).
*Plates with 200uL transformants: 3000~4000. 
*Negative control: 0.
*Note: it makes sense that the 200uL transformants grew less because I used 2 different tubes of competent cells. The less efficient one is weaker because it was treated with <math>CaCl_2</math> for a longer time(~ 1 hour).

===Fetch the biobricks J01060, B0015 and R0040===
*Note: we should make a better design and plan so that there can be fewer cases where we found we need new biobricks.

===Antibiotics Solution Preparation===
*Chloramphenicol: 34mg/mL, 10mL. solved in C2H5OH.
*Ampicillin: 50mg/mL, 10mL.
*Kanamycin: 50mg/mL, 10mL.
*Stored at -20â„ƒ.
*Note: All solution was filtered by sterile syringe filter, and was divided into 0.5mL tubes.

===Transformation===
*Transformed R0040, J01060, B0015 into DH5alpha competent cells.
*proT as positive control, empty cells as negative control.

===Plans for tomorrow===
*Digestion Test of the extracted plasmid(The DNA dye has come! ^_^).
*Miniprep of the rest biobricks plasmids.
*Order a Fluorescence Intensity Test from the company.
