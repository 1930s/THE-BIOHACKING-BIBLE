==Suggestion For Tmprovement==
Tomas and I figured that an O-Scope would work better for timing rather then a stop watch. With some trial and error we were able to make some accurate timing measurements by calculating the 10 and 90% of the expecting bias voltage then used markers to determine the time it took for the voltage to reach the 90% mark. This makes the lab a bit more time consuming but timing measurement were improved by about 30%.
