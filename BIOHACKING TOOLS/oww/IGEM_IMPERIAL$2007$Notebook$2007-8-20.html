==Pilot Preparation of Vesicles==
'''Formation of Vesicles'''

The remaining two of the four suspensions prepared the [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Notebook/2007-8-16#Pilot Preparation of Vesicles | week before]] (one well-desiccated and one poorly-desiccated) were used to form vesicles:
* 2ml of each suspension was used to prepare an interface, according to the protocol.
* 10x diluted GFP solution was used to prepare the emulsion.
* Special care was taken to protect the GFP solution from light at all times.

Six samples were prepared:
* Two following the protocol, with 2ml suspension interface and 100&mu;l of each of two emulsions added:
** Sample 1: Well desiccated suspension interface with 100&mu;l of emulsion from well desiccated suspension, centrifuge at 120x g for 10mins.
** Sample 2: Well desiccated suspension interface with 100&mu;l of emulsion from well desiccated suspension, centrifuge at 30x g for 20mins.
* Four using 2ml of emulsion to form the interface, without further addition of material:
** Sample 3: 2ml of emulsion poorly desiccated suspension, centrifuge at 30x g for 20mins.
** Sample 4: 2ml of emulsion from well desiccated suspension, centrifuge at 120x g for 10mins.
** Sample 5: 2ml of emulsion from well desiccated suspension, centrifuge at 30x g for 20mins.
** Sample 6: 2ml of emulsion from well desiccated suspension, no centrifuge.

'''Results'''

A fluorescence microscope was used to inspect the samples:
* Sample 1: Sample not looked at.
* Sample 2: Sample not looked at.
* Sample 3: Sample not looked at.
* Sample 4: Tiny, bright, round specks of fluorescence were seen, only under 100x magnification, but they were too small to tell if they were vesicles.
* Sample 5: Sample not looked at.
* Sample 6: Tiny, bright, round specks of fluorescence were seen, only under 100x magnification, but they were too small to tell if they were vesicles.

'''Preparations'''

No preparations were carried out.
