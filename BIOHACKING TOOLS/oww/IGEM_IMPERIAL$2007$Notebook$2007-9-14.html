==Restriction Digest of Biobricks==
#4 DNA samples were digested by SpeI and PstI
#* Samples 5, 7, 24 
#1 DNA sample wasdigested by XbaI and PstI
#* Samples 23
#4 DNA samples were digested by EcoRI
#* Samples 13, 25, 27b-e, T7, Kirsten's parts
#4 μl of DNA was digested by 1 μl of enzymes at 37&deg;C for 1 hour<br>Exception: Sample 23 had 6 μl DNA and 2 μl enzymes

==Agarose Gel Electrophoresis of Biobricks==
#Checked 9 Biobricks and 13 Digests on 1% agarose gel 
[[Image:ICGEMS Gel 14 9.png]]

Conclusions:
*Part 27 is confirmed to be faulty
*T7 maxi-prep was not done properly
*Kirsten's parts were most likely not there...

==Gel Purification of Biobricks==

#Gel was melted and run through column
#Purified DNA was eluted with ddH<sub>2</sub>O
