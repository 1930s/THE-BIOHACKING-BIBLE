The Toronto Microfluidics Foundry is a flexible environment that specializes in the fabrication and integration of polymer-based microfluidic devices (often for biomedical applications). It complements [http://www.ecti.utoronto.ca/site3.aspx ECTI], the central cleanroom facility  at the University of Toronto. Users need to be trained according to the  [http://www.ehs.utoronto.ca/Home.htm UofT Health and Safety regulations] as well as individually at the equipment. Fulfilling these requirements is a prerequisite for access.

Note: Changed the nitrogen tank for the spinner

IMPORTANT: I found the spinner in a real mess. There was resist *everywhere*. I changed the Aluminum foil liner, but there was so much SU-8 (?) there that it had already seeped through the liner, and formed a big puddle in the black bowl underneath. If whoever's made the mess could please take out that bowl and get rid of all the gunk, it would be appreciated. And please, PLEASE change the Aluminum foil liner EVERY TIME you use the spinner. It's so much easier to clean that way.

==ADVANCE BOOKING==
If you plan to use the lab in the future, please submit your times in advance to prevent double bookings. Note that for all times outside the normal working hours (workdays 9AM-5PM), you are only allowed to fabricate if you bring a second trained person with you.

==PURCHASING INFORMATION==

===Purchasing Photomasks===

--Microart Services Inc.----------
Tel: 905 709 2244
Fax: 905 709 1873
50 West Beaver Creek,
Richmond Hill, ON,
L4B 1G5

Steps:
1 - Convert your file into a .gerber file. I use LinkCad.

2 - Send your file to padplot@primus.ca

3 - Call the company and tell him about it, make sure he knows where  
to ship it, etc.

4 - When you recieve the invoice & photomask, have Sheila Baker send a  
cheque out to him. The company only accepts cheques. You'll need Axel  
to sign the invoice with an account #.

Ships in 1 day, comes the next day.
-------------------------------------

--www.photoplotstore.com--------------------
1-888-821-1748
they're based somewhere in the US

Steps:
1 - Convert your file to .gerber

2 - Click the grid size you want (ie 1/8 mil, 1/20 mil), it should be  
the first thing you see under "Precision Laser Photoplots". also, 1  
mil = 25 um

3 - Upload your file

4 - Fill out the payment form

5 - Call him (cuz last time i didn't and he didn't do anything)

Also ships in 1 day, comes next day.
------------------------------------------------

I find Microart has better quality transparencies, but  
www.photoplotstore.com has higher precision photoplotters.

'''
A. TO FABRICATE STRAIGHT WALL ON THICK SU-8 SAMPLE'''

'''Problem:''' The features has a large overhanging edge near the top; the walls were slanted

'''Cause:''' the photomask was not pressed firmly against the photofilm which causes UV light to leak around the photomask apertures

'''Solution:''' before exposure, cover the photomask with a large piece of 3x2 inches glass. Then, apply two thick stacks (10-15) microscope slides on either sides of the cover glass to be used as weight. 

'''Protocol:'''

'''Dehydration bake:'''

1. Dehydration bake @ 200 degrees for about 15 minutes

'''Spincoating:'''

1. 500RPM  DWELL: 10s   ACCELERATION: 10s

2. 2000RPM DWELL: 30s   ACCELERATION: 5s

3. 0RPM    DWELL: 0s    ACCELERATION: 10s

'''Pre-exposure bake:'''

1. 7 minutes @ 65 degrees

2. 20 minutes @ 95 degrees

3. allowed to cool to room temperature

'''Exposure:'''

1. cover the photomask as described above

2. UV exposure for 20 seconds

'''Post-exposure bake:'''

1. 2 minutes @ 65 degrees

2. 7 minutes @ 95 degrees

3. 2 minutes @ 65 degrees

'''Develop:'''

1. Develop in 20ml of developer with mild to strong agitation for 20 minutes

2. Replace with 20ml of fresh developer

3. Develop further for another 20 minutes



An excel file with a fairly generic parameter table has been created on the desktop of the common computer in the fabrication lab.  If you could input all your SU-8 fabrication data there, it'd be very useful.  Thanks,  Chris.

===LAB SAFETY===

Access to the foundry requires users to be complient with the  [http://www.ehs.utoronto.ca/Home.htm UofT health and Safety regulations] and to be individually trained by a member of Dr. Guenther's group at the equipment. Users that don't fulfill these requirements are denied access.
