*[http://geneontology.org/ Gene Ontology] provides a controlled vocabulary to describe gene and gene product attributes in any organism. GO terms are organized in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), which differ from hierarchies in that a 'child' (more specialized term) can have many 'parents' (less specialized terms). GO terms are connected by 'is a' (generalizations) and 'part of' (composition) relationships.
