==Final presentation==
*Everyone should be ready to present during the final class meeting.
*Format and organization is (intentionally) open-ended, with the following constraints:
:#Seven minutes per person, including discussion
:#Do not pretend the room is full of non-experts (no long, fluffy introductions)


==Course Evaluations==
*Visit [http://my.harvard.edu/ my.harvard.edu] &rarr; "courses" tab &rarr; Course evaluations.
*If you wish to share ideas or comments that are not captured by Harvard's evaluation system, feel free to contact Dr. Church and/or the TFs directly.
