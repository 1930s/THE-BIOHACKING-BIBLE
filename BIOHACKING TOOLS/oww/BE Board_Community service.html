=='''Thank you!'''==
I would like to thank all those that helped out in our community service projects this year.  I had a lot of fun and think we had quite a successful year.

I would also like to recognize two people who contributed many hours of their time and participated in or helped organize every community service project that I planned.  I would like to give an Award for Outstanding Community Service to '''Amy Nichols''' and '''Maxine Jonas'''.  

This award includes a $50 gift certificate to Patagonia.  Each year Patagonia pledges at least 1 percent of their sales to the protection and restoration of the natural environment.  Last year they spent over two million dollars towards environmental initiatives in communities throughout the world.  I think these awards are fitting as this company shares similar interests in giving back to the community.   

Thank you again to Amy and Maxine!

'''7th annual Charles River Clean Up:'''  Saturday, April 29th, 9:30am-12pm.  

Our group was assigned to the MIT side of the Charles, between the Mass Ave Bridge and the Longfellow.  We had a lot of fun making the Charles cleaner and found some interesting trash!

Thank you to those that volunteered: Melissa Kemp, Amy Nichols, Maxine Jonas, Helene Karcher, and Ben Cosgrove (and Elissa).  Here are some photos!

'''Bread and Jams Sunday Meal''', 1/22/06.  We helped prep food at St. James Church that was served to those in need in the Cambridge community.  Thanks to the 14 BE members that came!  It was very rewarding to meet some of their clients and see the difference that Bread and Jams makes!

'''October 19th''', Wednesday, 5-8pm, at Community Servings in Roxbury.  We brought a group of four excited BE folks to prepare and package meals that will be delivered to individuals and families in the Boston area living with AIDS and other acute life-threatening illnesses.
