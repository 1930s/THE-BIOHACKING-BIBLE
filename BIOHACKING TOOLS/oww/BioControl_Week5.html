==Discussion==
*The cells are selecting for noisy function<cite>Korobdova</cite>, but too much noise (particularly with extreme amplification) would seem to be a problem. If you could specify everything in this system, where would you want noise?
*Drunken random walks seem to be a common solution to this kind of problem - why?
**It looks to me ([[User:Jkm|Jkm]]) like a good way to deal with noisy inputs. Is there more to it? Are there better (engineering?) ways of solving the same problem?
*Going from experiments to models (particularly in biology) - are assumptions (CheB only demethylates active receptors) good, since they give us testable hypotheses? Or bad, since they're just artificial constraints in order to get the 'right' answer?
