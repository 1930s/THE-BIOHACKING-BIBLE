==set up== 
I set up the oscilloscope with a BNC cable to ch1 connecting to the low output of the generator. Generator producing sine waves at ~50 Hz. Set on DC coupling.

ch1 positioned at v=0. Trigger set at v=0, slope-rising.

==Measurements==

'''Measurement-''' Voltage with original wave
     1. using the grid to measure amplitude  
        of the wave I get ~4.4 volts.
     2. using the cursor mode I find an      
        amplitude of ~4.64 volts.
     3. Using the measure control I again   
        find an amplitude of ~4.64 volts. 

     REPEATS:making voltage measurements using the measure 
     and cursor controls for waves of different 
     applitudes and 20 and 30 hz.
     1. 20hz wave, I find 2.72 volts after   
        adjusting the amplitude.
     2. 30 hz with another adjusted amplitude I find
        1.36 volts as the amplitude.

'''Measurements-''' frequency - original wave (f=1/T)
     1. Grid- I find period of ~20ms and so for frequency I find ~50hz
     2. Cursor- I find a frequency of ~50Hz
     3. Measure control- I find a frequency of ~49.50 Hz

     REPEATS:making frequency measurements using the measure 
     and cursor controls for waves of 2.4v 
     applitudes and 30 hz.
     1. Cursor- 30.6 Hz
     2. Measure control- I find 30.6 Hz

        * Trying these functions for different types of waveforms
         (square wave, etc) to measure frequency and amplitude
         the oscilloscope seems to do so properly.*
       **Dr. Koch helped to explain calculate frequency from period and to use the
         functions on the oscilloscope**

==Triggering==
  {{Side comment|comment=[[User:Steven J. Koch|Steven J. Koch]] 00:44, 29 August 2007 (EDT):Great description!}}
    A) What does triggering on the rising edge mean?
        - this means that the trigger is set at a specified voltage on the 
          oscilloscope,and when the waveform reaches that value and is increasing, 
          event is registered.

==AC Coupling== 
{{Side comment|comment=[[User:Steven J. Koch|Steven J. Koch]] 00:51, 29 August 2007 (EDT):Excellent work on the AC coupling and in particular the calculation of the RC constant.  I couldn't find anything when I tried either, but Antonio did find an article that looked promising.}}

     A)Read the ac coupling article
     B)Getting a voltage of about 12V, and then looking at the AC coupling to shift the signal
       back to zero voltage, and then decreasing the sec/div and volts/div a distinct 
       but 'noisy' sine component appears. The amplitude of the wave is ~10mV and a frequency
       of ~50kHz.
     C)Measuring Fall time - cursor function
         1. Using 1.12 volt square wave, and measuring with the cursor command I find a 
            fall time of ~52ms
         2. 880mV square wave, I find ~52ms
     C) Measuring Fall time - Measure function
         1. 880mV square wave, I find ~50ms
         2. 1.12 V square wave, I find ~50ms
     D)To find the RC constant we can use the equations given to us in the wikipedia article
       on the lab outline. The equation gives us <math>.1=(exp(-t/s))</math> where t is the
       fall off time calculated previously and s is the RC constant. Solving this equation I   
       find s=22.5 milli sec.
     E)I was unable to find any information on the RC constant that I should expect on 
       the internet.


     ** Had help from TA in calculating the RC constant, and from Dr. Koch in using the 
        correct equation to do so.**

==FFT==

     1)Using the FFT math function to find the frequency of a sine wave and with help from Zane
       Gibson, I find the frequency is 80Hz. Which matches up with what the wave generator is
       producing.
     2)
