#Assume your poster is 40" X 40" which is what your page setup options will read in powerpiont.
#At this point, you have to install a dummy poster printer; I installed a HP Designjet 3500 but any old poster printer will do.
#Now set the paper size to custom and something large enough to accommodate your entire poster.
#At this point, you can now print to a pdf file and the file will now show up in the size at which you selected the paper source.
