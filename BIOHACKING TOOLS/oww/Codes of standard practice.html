Like any powerful technology, biological engineering has the potential to be misused either accidentally or deliberately.  To ensure that all possible safeguards are built in to the technology from the beginning, BBF members and volunteers will develop technical standards, including design rules for BioBricks that enable the straightforward detection, identification, and authentication of engineered DNA, both in laboratory settings and in the environment.
