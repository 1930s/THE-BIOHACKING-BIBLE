==Initial Safety Requirement for New Lab Members==

All new lab members must:
# Read the Purdue Chemical Hygiene Plan
# Read the Purdue Biological Safety Manual
# Familiarize themselves with the Specific Safety Notes below for the areas in which they will be working
# Take note of the Hazard Assessment Sheet on the door of your work area
# Locate the MSDS books in your work area
# Document their training on the wiki Safety Training Log

If you will be handling or working around biological samples.  You must
# Complete the on-line Biological Safety Training
# Familiarize yourself with the Bindley Bioscience Center Policies

If you will be working with human cell lines (such as the Caco-2 cells) you must:
# Read the Handling Human Cell Lines presentation

==Special Safety Notes of Particular Relevance to the Rickus Lab==
===general lab handling===

#'''Birck Nanotechnology Center'''.  Absolutely NO biological materials are to enter Birck without explicit permission.  To obtain permission and policies, please see Lisa Reece in the Molecular Cytometry Labs.  lreece@purdue.edu
#'''Dry Ice'''.  Many of our incoming shipments will arrive packed in dry ice.  Dry ice is solid [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide carbon dioxide].  Dry ice is extremely cold.  Special care should be taken.  Use insulated gloves to handle the dry ice.  In addition, dry ice required good ventilation in the room.  The solid CO2 will sublimate into gaseous CO2 which can fill a closed space and result in suffication.

===Biomolecules Lab, Bindley Room 234===
#'''piranha solution'''  This cleaning agent is commonly used in the biopolymer chemical area.  There are forceps and beakers that are set aside for use of piranha solution.  Please do not use these materials for any other use.

===Cell Culture Lab, Bindley Room 158===
#'''Cell Lines'''.  Currently all cells in 158 are Biosafety Level 1 (BSL1) cells.  Please note that waste generated from BSL1 culture is treated as "look-a-like" waste, but it not a biohazard.  Please do not use red autoclave bags or biohazard labels on BSL1 waste.
#'''Gas Cylinders'''  Gad cylinders can serve as projectiles if damaged or knocked over.  All cylinders must be properly secured using a chain or a strap.  In addition, all cylinders must be either capped during storage or have a regulator during use.  There should not be any uncapped cylinders in the lab or storage areas.
#'''Liquid Nitrogen'''

===The Dog House, Bindley Room 152===
#'''Nitric Oxide'''  Nitric Oxide (NO) is a Class A dangerous gas which could be inhaled without any obvious external indications (i.e. you might not know it).  Nitric oxide can be directly toxic to blood, lungs, nervous system, pancreas and skin.  NEVER intentionally inhale NO.  NO should not be confused with the "laughing gas", nitrous oxide N2O, that you get at the dentist!
#'''Laboratory Scale'''  Please be sure to clean up the scale after use.  This includes washing the weighing utensils, brushing off any spilled chemicals, and using a wet paper towel, if necessary.
#'''pH Meter'''  Please read and understand the instructions prior to use. If you are unsure of how to PROPERLY use the meter, please ask for assistance.  We have recently had to purchase a new pH probe due to misuse.
