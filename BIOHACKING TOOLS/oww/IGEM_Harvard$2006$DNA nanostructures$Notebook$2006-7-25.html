[[c5.0 Partial Oligo Order Form]]


==Purification==

====PEG precipitation====
* Used samples of 3.2.H and 3.2.I [[IGEM:Harvard/2006/DNA_nanostructures/Notebook/2006-7-24#Folding_reaction|folded yesterday]]
* 20 {{ul}} of each, 190 mL water, 50 mL 20% PEG / 2.5 M NaCl in respective 500 {{ul}} PCR tubes
[[Image:20060725_peg.jpg|thumb|]]
* gel analysis ({{aggel}}):
** lanes 3 and 6 (reconstituted precipitate of H and I, respectively) appear to be free of oligos (compare to lanes 2 and 5, which are raw folding reaction), but yields are still very low, as evidenced by amount of nanostructures in supernatant (lanes 4 and 7)

====Gel purification====
* 20 mL each of 3.2.D and 3.2.E run on a {{aggel}} gel
* nanostructure bands isolated and purified using Qiagen gel purification kit (good for fragments up to 10 kb according to manufacturer)
* will run on agarose gel tomorrow to determine purity

==Silver staining experiments==
* goal: to determine the minimum concentration of streptavidin that can be visualized with silver stain, and to note the times at which different concentrations become visible
* methods: 12% PA gel with lanes listed below, run for 20 min. at 130 V, then stained with [http://bio-rad.com/B2B/BioRad/product/br_category.jsp?BV_SessionID=@@@@0044032730.1153852982@@@@&BV_EngineID=cccdaddiglfhhimcfngcfkmdhkkdfll.0&categoryPath=%2fCatalogs%2fLife+Science+Education%2fEquipment+and+Supplies%2fProteins+and+Proteomic+Studies%3a+Equipment+and+Reagents%2fProtein+Stains%2fSilver+Stain+Plus+Kit&catLevel=6&divName=Corporate&loggedIn=false&lang=English&country=HQ&catOID=-19568&isPA=false&serviceLevel=Lit+Request Bio-Rad Silver Stain Plus Kit] and [http://bio-rad.com/LifeScience/pdf/Bulletin_9056.pdf protocol].
** 35 min. in fixative solution
** 2 x 10 min. wash in water
** XX min. in staining solution
** 15 min. in stopping solution

* results:
** first three lanes (40k, 20k, 10k pmol) stain reliably
** fourth and fifth lane lane (5k, 2.5k pmol) barely stains
** the rest of the lanes (1.25k pmol and less) do not stain more than the background
** this is disappointing (we can image 1 pmol of streptavidin with Coomassie blue)
