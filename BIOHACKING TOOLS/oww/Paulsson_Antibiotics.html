MOA, references<br>

always run through a 0.2um filter (to sterilize and remove undissolved antibiotic, especially for single cell work!!!)

working concentrations depend on copy number


'''Ampicillin''' (sodium salt)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampicillin]<br>
stock solution: 100 mg/ml in water (unstable, do not store too long or freeze/thaw aliquots more that 3 times)

'''Kanamycin''' [http://openwetware.org/wiki/Kanamycin]<br>
stock solution: 35 mg/ml in water<br>

'''Chloramphenicol''' [http://openwetware.org/wiki/Chloramphenicol]<br>
stock solution: 100 mg/ml in 95% EtOH (don't filter, EtOH will dissolve filter membrane)
For low copy plasmids (e.g. p15A and F origins), use 15 ug/ml chloramphenicol.<Br>
For complete inhibition of protein synthesis, as when measuring protein degradation, use 100 ug/ml.

'''Spectinomycin'''

'''Gentamycin'''

'''Neomycin'''

'''Cephalexin'''<br>
stock solution:  20 mg/ml in approx. 60mM NH4OH (concentrated NH4OH is difficult to pipet accurately)(don't dissolve in 1M NH4OH as recommended by Sigma, unstable even when stored at -20deg).  MIC is 10 ug/ml.

'''Nalidixic acid'''<br>
stock solution:  50 mg/ml in 50mM NaOH

'''Novobiocin'''<br>
stock solution:  100 mg/ml in water (insoluble at lower PH, comes out of solution when added to LB)

'''Tetracycline'''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetracycline]<br>
stock solution: 10 mg/ml in water[http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/search/ProductDetail?ProdNo=T7660&Brand=SIGMA]<br>
working concentration: 10 ug/ml<br>
NB: use tetracycline hydrochloride, not anhydrous tetracycline used for induction of tet promoter
