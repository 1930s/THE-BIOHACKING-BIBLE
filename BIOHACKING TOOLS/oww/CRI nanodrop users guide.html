==General Info==
This SOP is a how to use guide for the analysis of DNA, RNA and Primer concentration using the Nanodrop ND-100. 

==Materials==
*P2 Single Channel Pipette
*ART 10 Reach sterile pipette tips
*Sterile de-ionised water
*Blue paper towel
*Samples for concentration testing.
*Nanodrop ND-100 Spectrophotometer connected to PC with correct Software.

==Procedure==
For DNA / Primer concentrations:

#Log onto Nanodrop PC using your user name and password.
#Open Nanodrop 3.0.0 by double clicking on the Nanodrop 3.0.0 icon on the desktop.
#Click on “Nucleic Acid Measurement” button.
#Using the blue paper towel, gently wipe both parts of the electrode.
#Load a fresh tip onto the pipette as specified in JGLSOP32
#Set the dispensing volume to 1µl
#Draw up 1µl of sterile de-ionised water and dispense onto the bottom electrode of the Nanodrop.
#Eject tip into yellow hazardous container after use.
#Lower the top arm down into position.
#Click “ok” button to initialize the spectrophotometer.
#Once complete, raise the arm and wipe both electrodes again with blue roll.
#Repeat steps 6 to 9 again.
#Click “Blank” button.
#Clean both electrodes again, using a fresh piece of blue paper towel.
#Ensure Sample Type box is set to DNA-50 for all DNA concentrations. If not, change using drop down menu. (For Primer concentrations, select “other” and change constant to “33”)
#Using a fresh tip, load pipette with sample (1µl) and dispense onto electrodes.
#Lower top arm.
#Click “Measure” button (located at the top left hand corner of the screen)
#Record Value (ng/µl) displayed at the bottom right hand side of the Nanodrop user screen. 
#Raise arm and clean electrodes using fresh piece of blue paper towel.
#Repeat steps 16 to 20 until the required number of samples have been analysed.
#Click on “Exit” button to leave program.
#Click “Exit” again to return to the desktop.
