As the undergraduate major in Biological Engineering evolves over the next few years, the undergraduate student board will progress through a parallel process.  The group is meant to provide support and representation for the undergraduate students within the major.  In order for the undergraduate board to fulfill it's mission, we need feedback from the COURSE 20 Majors.  

*What do you want from your student group?
*What types of events would you like to see organized?
*How can the department facilitate and improve your experience in Course 20?

Please post all comments and concerns on this page.  In addition, comments can be submitted anonymously through the feedback form on the graduate board's [[BE_Board:Contact |comment section.]]
