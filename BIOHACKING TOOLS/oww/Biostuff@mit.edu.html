===Invitation Letter===
*Ever wondered whether someone at MIT has that plasmid you need?
*Ever wondered whether someone here knows about a His-Tag antibody that actually works specifically?
*Ever wondered whether someone in this building has that SW41 rotor you need for a set of pilot experiments, as your PI does not want to shell out the $10000 right away ?
<br>
If the answer to things of this sort is yes, you are not alone. We have thought about this issue and are starting a new email list bioSTUFF@mit.edu where you can post requests to share knowledge, reagents or equipment and (possibly) get quick answers.  If you would like to post to and receive messages from this list, sign yourself up on this website: <br>https://mailman.mit.edu:444/mailman/listinfo/biostuff<br>
<br>
The simple rules:
*Sending & receiving is open to anybody who is a list subscriber.
*Anybody with an interest in biology at MIT can subscribe.
*The list will be [https://mailman.mit.edu:444/mailman/private/biostuff/ archived on the web] so that you can read past postings and answers too.
*Replies/answers to biostuff questions should go to the entire list (so that folks know if the question has been answered, and that the answer is available in the list archives).
<br>
Please use the list to post simple requests for reagents, know-how, equipment or anything else related.
If you have equipment to give away, this list is a good place for that as well. Summarizing your request in the subject line may increase your chances of a favorable reply.  If you think this new list might be useful for you or your lab, sign up today and make frequent use of it!<br>
<br>
Best wishes, and happy listing!<br>
