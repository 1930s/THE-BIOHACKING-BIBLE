'''Formation of Vesicles'''

Using a prepared well-dessicated, well sonicated DOPC/mineral oil suspension from [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Notebook/2007-8-21#Pilot Preparation of Vesicles | yesterday]], 
* 2ml of suspension was taken to prepare an interface according to protocol.
* 10x diluted GFP solution was used to prepare the emulsion; stirred gently with magnetic stirrer.
* Special care was taken to protect the GFP solution from light at all times.

4 samples prepared:
* Sample 1: 2ml of emulsion, no centrifuge.
* Sample 2: Following the protocol, with 2ml suspension interface and 100&mu;l of emulsion added.
* Sample 3: 2ml of emulsion, centrifuge at 120x g for 10mins.
* Sample 4: 2ml of emulsion, centrifuge at 30x g for 20mins.


'''Results'''

Light Microscopy (Magnification - 100x):
* Emulsion: Vesicles seen, presumably monolayer.
* Sample 1: Water-oil interface observed. Presumably the phospholipids have clumped altogether.
* Sample 2: Vesicles seen. 
* Sample 3: Vesicles seen. 
* Sample 4: Vesicles seen. 

Fluorescence Microscopy (Magnification - 100x): 
* Emulsion: GFP vesicles seen. Lots of GFP artifacts.
* Sample 1: No fluorescent vesicles observed. 
* Sample 2: No fluorescent vesicles observed. 
* Sample 3: "Vesicles" of sizes 1-10 &mu;m found encapsulating GFP within. Lots of GFP artifacts.
* Sample 4: "Vesicles" of sizes 1-10 &mu;m found encapsulating GFP within. Lots of GFP artifacts.
