==Mini Prep==
# Harvest the bacterial cells by centrifugation at 5000rpm for 5 min. at 4˚C
# Pipette/Decant out LB suspension
# Resuspend pelleted bacterial cells in 0.3 ml Buffer P1 (in Falcone fridge) and transfer to a microcentrifuge tube
#*ensure that RNase A has been added to Buffer P1
#  Add 0.3 ml of Buffer P2, mix thoroughly by vigorously inverting the sealed tube 4-6 times (or until homogenous), and incubate at room temperature for (no more than) 5 min. 
#* do not vortex
#* close Buffer P2 immediately after use
# Add 0.4 ml of chilled Buffer N3, mix immediately and thoroughly by vigorously inverting 4-6 times, and incubate (on ice) for 5 min. 
# Centrifuge for 10min. at 13,000 rpm
# Apply the supernatants from step 4 into the QIAprep spin column by decanding or pipetting.
# Centrifuge for 30-60 seconds on max speed. Discard flow-through
# Wash QIAprep spin column by adding 0.5 ml Buffer PB and centrifuging for 30-60 s. Discard the flow-through.
# Discard the flow-through, and centrifuge for an additional 1 min to remove residual wash buffer. 
# Place the QIAprep column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. To elute DNA, add 50 µl water (or Buffer EB) to the center of each QIAprep spin column, let stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min.

==Nanodrop (~20ng/ul) Protocol==
#Start ND-1000 program
#Select "nucleic acid"
#2 µL water
#Push OK
#Wipe top and bottom
#2 µL EB buffer (or water if used for elution)
#Select "blank"
#Wipe top and bottom
#2 µl sample

#Record the content of DNA in the lower right hand corner in ng/µl
==PCR amplification of EGFP==
# Assemble 2 reaction tubes; one with a complete reaction and another without template that serves as a control
# Set Reaction Tubes/Plates on Ice
# Add the following components in a reaction vessel. Total volume should be between .5-20 µl.
#* 45 µl Platinum PCR SuperMix
#* Primers (200 nM final concentration per primer is recommended)
#* Template DNA solution
# Cap reaction vessel and load into a thermal cycler at 94°C

## 72°C for 10 minutes
## 4°C forever
==Run agarose gel of PCR products==

===Obtaining a Cast===
#got a PCR gel cast holder from supply room
#got PCR cast from neighboring bay
*How to improvise a cast when you don’t have the cast holder (which makes two sides of the gel):
*#Use tape to make a wall for the cast
*#Seal edges with nail, 
*#*Don’t let tape hang over bottom or else cast will not sit flat.

===Protocol for Preparing Agarose Gel===
#Add 50 mL of 1% agarose solution to a 125 mL sterilized Erlenmeyer flask.  
#*Pour relatively quickly so solution doesn’t cool and harden
# For every 50mL of gel, add 5 µL of CyberSafe DNA gel stain (10000X concentration).  
#Swirl flask to mix gel stain and agarose solution
#*Gel stain is located on shelf above PCR machine
#Place 8-well comb into cast
#Pour solution into cast, until solution level nearly reaches the tops of the walls.  
#*Gel will set in about 15-20 minutes.  
#*You know it’s ready when gel is no longer clear
# You can get rid of bubbles and push hairs away from wells with a pipette tip
#Dispose of remaining agarose; either let it harden and shake it out into trash or pour it down the sink with a LOT of water.

===Protocol for Preparing to Run a Gel Electrophoresis===
#Combine for samples to be loaded into gel:
#*2 µL of sample/bp ladder
#*14 µL of water
#*4 µL of 5X loading buffer
#*Total volume: 20 µL
#Separated 2 uL of sample (into eppendorf strip) to run in the gel.  Saved 48 µL of sample (in original vial). 
#Flick vials to mix contents before you pipette them out
#Put 2 µL of 100bp ladder into 6th well
#Put 2 µL of 1kbp ladder into 7th well
#*PCR Tube Sequence: 1-  1+  2+  3-  3+   100bp   1kbp
#*Sample key (yesterday, the three groups PCR’d a sample w/ and w/o template):
#*;- :No template
#*;+ :Has template
#*;Number :Corresponds to team
#Put 1 mL of 5X loading buffer into an eppendorf tube (to avoid opening and reopening)
#*Loading buffer contains glycerol to make samples sink into wells and contains colored dye to color DNA 
#*Yellow dye is light and runs with lightest bits to indicate when your sample is about to run off the end of the gel
#*NOTE: What does the 5X mean? It indicates the concentration of buffer (or whatever has that label) that should be in the final mixture.  So in this case, Final Mixture = 20 µL and Concentration = 5X, so Volume of Buffer in Final Mixture = 20/5 = 4 µL
#Add 4 µL of loading buffer to each sample to run in the electrophoresis
#Add 14 µL of water to bring total volume of each vial to 20 µL

==Protocol for Running a Gel Electrophoresis==
#Load 18 µL per sample into the wells (these samples should be the ones you prepared in the above protocol)
#*Sample sequence in agarose gel wells:
#*Blank  1kbp  1-  1+  2+  3-  3+  .1kb
#*NOTE: 2+ lost some sample
#Run the electrophoresis at 85V for 45 minutes
#*If voltages is too high, your gel will melt (even though it will run more quickly)
#*The current puts an upper limit on voltage
#*Check on the gel periodically to make sure you haven’t run off the gel
#When electrophoresis is done, remove lid, lift mold with gel out of buffer, have paper towel ready to blot

==PCR Cleanup==
#Use QIAquick (a PCR cleanup kit made by QIAGEN):
#*NOTE: make sure ethanol is in Buffer PE mixture.  We did not clean controls today
#Add five volumes of buffer PBI to one volume of PCR mix
#*We have 48 µL so add ~250 µL of buffer per sample
#*Not all of the 250 µL fit, so we put in 125 µL directly into sample vial and the other 125 µL into the QIAquick column
#Check that the color of the mixture is yellow (similar to Buffer PBI without the PCR sample).  
#*If color is orange or violet, add 10 uL of 3M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and mix.  The color of the mixture will turn yellow
#Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 mL collection tube
#To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30-60 s
#Discard flow-through.  Place QUIAquick column back into same tube.
#To wash, add .75 mL Buffer PE to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30-60s
#*if you let it sit for 1-2 min, reaction works better
#Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back in the same tube.  Centrifuge for 1 min
#*NOTE: residual ethanol from Buffer PE will not be completely removed unless the flow-through is discarded before this additional centrifugation
#Place QIAquick column in a clean 1.5 ml centrifuge tube
#To elute DNA, add 40 µL Buffer EB (10mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5) or water to the center of the QIAquick membrane. 
#(The longer we let it sit there than the better it does.   
#Centrifuge the column for 1 min.  
#(Optional) For higher DNA concentration, add 30 uL elution buffer to the center of the QIAquick membrane, let the column stand for 1 min, then centrifuge.
#If purified DNA is to be analyzed on a gel, add 1 volume of loading dye to 5 volumes of purified DNA.  Mix solution by pipetting up and down before loading the gel.

==Notes for Double Digestion==
*Cut 2 places at once using 2 different enzymes.  
**With double digestion, must find compatible conditions for both restriction enzymes.  
**Use the NEB book and find Double enzyme chart.
*XBaI and EcoR1.
*BSA keeps things from sticking to each other.  
**So check the enzymes (look in Section 1) and see if require anything  special.  
**If recommends BSA for only one, still use it.  
*Avoid Star activity-when restriction enzyme cuts when it’s not supposed to.  
**Happens when Glycerol is too high (above 5%).  So most commercial enzymes are 50% glycerol.  Not frozen at -20 degrees.  
*Digestion rate of restriction enzymes: 1 µg of DNA/1hr/1 restriction enzyme
#Make digestion mixture for insert and vector (in separate vials).  
#*IMPORTANT: ENZYME goes in LAST
#*Enzymes are located in big fridge next to centrifuge (now in our fridge?)
#*Our enzymes are in the BioBricks box
#*When pipetting enzymes, do it relatively quickly and don’t stick tip in too far, otherwise you will suck up more enzyme than you intended
#Place digestion mixtures into hot room for 3 hours

==Protocol for Imaging Result and Gel Diagnostic==
#“Gel Electrophoresis Imaging” *red light = measuring
#Remove gel from buffer solution (use paper towel)
#Place container with gel on slide (leave door open)
#*Light – “upper white”, Emission Filter – “short wave”, 500 ms
#*Get image and adjust to focus/center
#Close door
#*Change Light to “trans illumination”
#*Get image and adjust contrast to focus (re-image after each adjustment)
#Save to file – Endy  iGEM folders
#Export as .tif or .jpeg
#Print
#*Diagnostic:
	**Use NEB to find ladder images, check to see if your PCR results are where you expect them (near the correct bp band)
