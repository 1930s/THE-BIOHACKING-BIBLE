The [http://ecoli.aist-nara.ac.jp/gb6/Resources/deletion/deletion.html Keio collection] is a collection of systematic single-gene knock-out mutants of E. coli K-12 done by the [http://ecoli.aist-nara.ac.jp/ Functional Genomic Analysis of E. coli in Japan] project <cite>Baba-MSB-2006</cite>.

You can request strains from them.

[http://ecoli.aist-nara.ac.jp/Resource/ResourceManage.jsp Request form] - note that they are quoting a shipping delay of 2 months due to so many requests.

Alternatively, you can obtain the relevant plasmids for doing the knockouts yourself from the [http://cgsc.biology.yale.edu/cgsc.html CGSC] (pKD13 and pKD46 are needed most likely)<cite>Datsenko-PNAS-2000</cite>.
