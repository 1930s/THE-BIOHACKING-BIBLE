==Introduction to Cyanobacteria==
*Cyanobacteria generate oxygen gas through oxygenic photosynthesis. Unlike purple sulfur bacteria or purple non-sulfur bacteria, cyanobacteria use chlorophyll a to gather light.
*Cyanobacteria live close to the surface of ponds, and have two major absorption bands between 550-620 due to phycobiliproteins. 
==Synechocystis sp 6803 Genetics==
*Synechocystis carries multiple (6-12) copies of the genome in a single cell.
*Synechocystis has about 3,260 genes that code for proteins.
*Synechocystis is naturally transformable, i.e. it will uptake foreign DNA and incorporate this DNA into its genome by homologous recombination.

==Synechocystis sp 6803 Growth==
*The doubling time of Synechocystis is 12 hours (versus 20 minutes for E. coli), and it takes 7-10 days to get visible colonies of transformants on a plate.
*Liquid media: BG-11 media, Sigma catalog #, 500 mL of 50x ~$30
*Light intensity: 50-70 umol photons m2/s
*Temperature: 30-34 ÂºC
*pH: 8-10

==Synechocystis sp 6803 Metabolism==
*CO2 is assilimated through the Calvin cycle. 
*Not fully functional citric acid cycle.
*Pentose phosphate is central pathway of carbohydrate metabolism. 
*Gram negative (double membrane). 
*Heterocysts form to fix nitrogen when NO3 and NH3 are absent.

==Synechocystis sp 6803 Physiology==
*Synechocystis is typically a slightly oblong spheriod, approximately 1.5 microns in diameter.
