This page is intended to be a collection point for code designed to process data from the plate reader.  Please feel free to add  code here or supply feedback on existing code so that it can be improved.

==Importing data into data analysis packages==
The plate reader software can export data in excel format or in a plain text file.  
*[[Endy:Victor3 plate reader/Data analysis tools/MATLAB Import|'''MATLAB Import''']] - This MATLAB script will read in a text file exported from the plate reader and save a .mat file with the important variables for further processing.

==Data processing==
*[[Endy:Victor3 plate reader/Data analysis tools/Excel processing macro|'''Excel data processing macro''']] - This Excel macro operates on a results file exported from the plate reader in .xls format.
*[[Endy:Victor3 plate reader/Data analysis tools/MATLAB scripts|'''MATLAB Data Processing''']] - This set of MATLAB scripts can be used to analyzed time course of data of cells growing in the plate reader and expressing a fluorescent protein.
