===Notes===
General lab courtesy - if you use a whole sleeve of plates, make another. If you use a lot of a stock or finish it, make some more. Everyone should help aliquot electrocomp cells. 

===How It Works===
Each person is assigned a laboratory job (or set of jobs based on intensity of the assigned job) and an administrative role (indicated in italics). Please keep up with your assigned jobs. Note, that it is everyone's responsibility to load tips, load the dishwasher, and rinse out your glassware. Also, while general DO plates are made (-U, -T, and -U -T) as common stocks, all other DO plates are made by the individual using them.
