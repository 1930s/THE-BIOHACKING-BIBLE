SDS Gel electrophoresis<br>
<br>
gels with SDS (makes 2 baby gels; 24 wells total))<br>
<br>
Separating Gel (goes on the Bottom of the gel):<br>
40% (19:1) Acrylamide:Bis Acrylamide solution	3ml <br>
1M Tris Buffer pH 8.9				4.68ml<br>
ddH20						4.2ml<br>
10% SDS solution				125ul<br>
total volume					12ml<br>
pour 4ml per gel (up to bottom of green bar)<br>
<br>
1.  Mix and add 50ul of fresh ammonium persulfate (0.05g/500ul of water)
and 8ul of Temed.  (The more Temed you add, the faster the polymerization)<br>
2.  Pour quickly using small beaker<br>
3.  Layer 2-methyl-1-propanol (iso-butanol) on top or plain ethanol or just water (all work well for us)<br>
4.  Leave at room temperature for >30min to polymerize<br>
5.  Wash out isobutanol with distilled water <br>
<br>
Stacking Gel (goes on the top of the gel where the combs are):<br>
40% (19:1) Acrylamide:Bis Acrylamide solution	0.735ml<br>
1M Tris Buffer pH 6.8				0.875ml<br>
ddH20						5.24ml<br>
10% SDS solution				75ul<br>
total volume					6.93 ml<br>
pour 2ml per gel (leave 3mm gap to top of small plate)<br>

1.  Mix and then add 50ul of fresh ammonium persulfate (0.05g/500ul of water)
and 5ul of Temed.<br>
2.  Pour quickly using small beaker <br>
3.  Place combs in, clean up any spillage<br>
3.  Leave at room temperature for >20min to polymerize<br>
4.  If not using immediately, pull combs out and wash wells with water, remove plates from rack, wrap in saran wrap, label with name and date<br>
5.  If using immediately, put into gel box 
so that small plate faces the core of the box; or 1 gel facing in and the buffer dam on the other side)<br>
6.  Lock the plates in, pour buffer into the core of the box so that it goes over the combs and into the bas of the box<br>
7.  Remove combs very carefully pulling straight up, the wells break easily and can "fall" into each other<br>
8.  Use a pipette tip to straight any out of line wells<br>

2x Sample buffer choice #1<br>
Tris Buffer pH 6.7	2.5ml<br>
Glycerol		2ml<br>
water			3.3ml<br>
Filter through a 0.45uM filter and then add<br>
10%SDS		2ml<br>
2.5% Bromophenol blue	2.5mg<br>
total volume		10ml<br>

2x Sample buffer choice #2<br>
Tris Buffer pH 6.7	10ml<br>
10% SDS		15ml<br>
80% Glycerol		6.25ml<br>
2.5% Bromophenol blue	0.5ml<br>
water			2ml<br>
total volume		40ml<br>
<br>
1.  Store sample buffer at RT; (before use add 1 part 1M DTT to 4 parts sample buffer #2 (not necessary for #1))<br>
2.  Dilute samples with sample buffer 1:1, boil at 100degrees for 2 min.<br>
3.  Run baby gel at 8milliamps until dye has reached the separating gel then at 25milliamps until dye has reached the 
bottom of the gel<br>

10X SDS Running buffer<br>
Glycine		1134g<br>
Tris base	240g<br>
Add to 6 Liters of ddH20 while stirring<br>
After it is dissolved bring to final volume of 8L<br>
check ph, bring to 8.8, store at RT<br>
<br>
1XSDS Running Buffer<br>
Make fresh from 10X (1L of 10x into 9L of water)<br>
Add 20% SDS to give final concentration of 0.1% (50ml into 10L)<br>
