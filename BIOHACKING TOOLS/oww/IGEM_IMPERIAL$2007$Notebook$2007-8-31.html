==Cell by date - Operating Temperature Range (continue)==
'''Construct - pTet-GFP [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_I13522 BBa_I13522]'''<br>
'''Temperatures - 37 &deg;C and 20&deg;C'''
'''Aims''': To test for the behaviour of the DNA construct (pTet) at temperatures 20oC and 37oC by observing the amount of fluorescence produced over a period of 24 hours. <br>
*Measurements was carried out from the samples incubated overnight. 

Protocol can be found here under [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Experimental_Design/Phase2/Protocol_2.1.1|Phase 2-Operating Temperature Range]] on the experimental design page.

==Preliminary AHL testing==
'''Aim''': This experiment was done to test the response time and steady state of the pTet-LuxR-pLux-GFP DNA construct at the different AHL concentrations, ranging from 100nM, 50nM, and 10nM. 

Protocol can be found here under 
[[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Experimental_Design/Phase2/Protocol_2.2.1|Phase 2-Preliminary AHL testing]] on the experimental design page.

==GFP Calibration Curve==
'''Aim''': This experiment was done to generate a calibration curve of the amount of fluorescence generateed with respect to the concentration of GFP in the solution. 

Protocol can be found here under 
[[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Experimental_Design/Phase2/Protocol_1.2|Phase 2-GFP calibration curve]] on the experimental design page.
