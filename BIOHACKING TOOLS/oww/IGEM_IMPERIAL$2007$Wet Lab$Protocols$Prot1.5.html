'''Aims:'''
*Through our modeling it has become clear that in order to get the most effective Infecter detector system we will need LuxR to be at steady state. This is a fundamental problem with our initial construct because it is unlikely that LuxR will reach steady state under control of the pTet promoter. We are therefore are pursuing an alternative where by we will add purified LuxR to the in vitro system.
*The [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Projects/Biofilm_Detector/Modelling| Modeling Section]] on the infecter detector describes the initial modeling of both infecter detector constructs.
*Through literature a protocol that we can use to purify LuxR. We are planning to use this as a basis and modify it to suit our needs.
*For purification of LuxR we require a plasmid that can over express LuxR, we have identified two suitable plasmids and we are currently trying to obtain both. Depending on which one we choose we will have to vary the protocol.

'''Prepare Cell Lysate'''
#Colonies of BL21 with over expressing LuxR plasmid  should be streaked onto LB-ampicillin plates and grown over night at 37 &deg;C
#Colonies were used to inoculate a liter of LB-ampicillin prewarmed at 37 &deg;C, this is grown until an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.5 is reached, this is then chilled to 28 &deg;C.
#AHL 25uM and IPTG to final concentration of 1mM is then added with additional ampicillin (200ug/ml) and the culture continued to grown at 28 &deg;C for 4 hours, this step is when we want to express the LuxR protein and so we need to first induce with IPTG, then add AHL for correct LuxR protein folding and finally a lower temperature to try to prevent inclusion body formation
#Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 x g for 10mins at 4 &deg;C and were frozen overnight at -80&deg;C
*The following steps were performed at 4 &deg;C:
#The Cell pellet should be resuspended in 16ml of '''A buffer''' and 25uM AHL. This cell suspension should then be sonicated.
#After sonication the lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 10 min. After this, remove the supernatant and centrifuge again at 100,000 x g for 1.5h.

'''Chromatography'''
#The cell extract from 100,000 x g is passed through a 5ml HiTrap herparin column and equilibrated with A buffer and 25uM AHL. Bound proteins are then eluted with a 25ml NaCL step gradient from 0.15 to 1M.
#The fractions collected need to see if they contain LuxR. This can be done using SDS-PAGE electrophoresis
#Now we need to remove the high levels of NaCl from our cell extract. Fractions containing LuxR are then pooled and dialyzed against 500ml of A buffer containing 25uM AHL and 20% (wt/vol) polyethylene glycerol(mw 8000)for four hours.
#After dialysis the sample was diluted 1:1 with a KCL and NaCL free version of A buffer plus 25uM AHL, this gives a final salt concentration of 75mM.
#Now we need to prepare a SP column, this needs to be equilibrated with buffer B and 25uM AHL.Then the sample can be run through and washed with B buffer. 
#Finally, to remove the bound protein the SP column can be eluted with 100ml linear NaCl gradients of 0.075 to 0.5M. To test fraction content and purity of LuxR, SDS-PAGE can be carried out.
