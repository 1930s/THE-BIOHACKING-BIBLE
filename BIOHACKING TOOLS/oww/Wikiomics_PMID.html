A [[wikipedia:PMID|PMID]] (PubMed IDentifier) is a unique identifier for each of the publications that are referenced in the PubMed database.

This wiki lets you cite a publication by giving only its PMID. The corresponding data will be automatically retrieved and formatted by [[Biblio|the system]].
The example below is the result which corresponds to the insertion of pmid=16504176:
