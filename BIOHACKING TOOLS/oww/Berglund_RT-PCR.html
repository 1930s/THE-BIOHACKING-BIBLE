RT-PCR is the method of reverse transcribing RNA to single stranded DNA and from single stranded DNA into double stranded DNA.<br>

We have two common methods that we use that have worked well for us in generating product from mRNA, transcribed RNA, spliced RNA, in vivo work, etc.<br><br>


The methods here are shown from SELEX RNA's and the primer concentrations have been optimized.  Optimization of primer concentrations is critical for RT to work.<br><br>
