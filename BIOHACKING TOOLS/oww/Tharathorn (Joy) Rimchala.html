=About=
This page is supposed to contain only a brief summary about me.

=Research Interests=
===Goal===
My general goal is to combine computational modeling and experimental tools to build a general framework for understanding initiation of signaling events, leading to specific cellular responses. My current research focus is on understanding the coupling between the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell_receptor T cell receptor] (TCR) signaling -- the essential signal for T cell activation -- and the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-stimulation costimulatory signalings] -- the auxillary signals thought to affect T cell activation by modulating TCR signaling. Other areas of research I would like to explore include the signaling cascades involved in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell T cell]/[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen_presenting_cell Antigen presenting cell] interactions, in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm circadian rhythm], in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration cell migration] and those in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanotransduction mechanotransduction].
