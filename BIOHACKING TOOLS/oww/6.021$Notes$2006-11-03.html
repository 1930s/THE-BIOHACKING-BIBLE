==Hodgkin-Huxley==
* Each factor can also be written as rates <math>\alpha,\beta</math>
* <math>x_\infty=\frac{\alpha_x}{\alpha_x+\beta_x}, \tau_x=\frac{1}{\alpha_x+\beta_x}</math>
* The effect of temperature is to multiple rates by <math>K_T = 3^{T_c-6.3}</math>
* An increase in temperature decreases all 3 time constants but has no effect on the final values.
* At high temperature, no action potential is seen
* There's another time constant due to capacitance in membrance
* Changes in conductances have time delay before membrane potential changes
* <math>\tau_M</math> (membrane "RC" time constant) is about 1-2 ms.
* <math>\tau_m \approx 1-2 ms, \tau_n \approx 3-4 ms, \tau_h \approx 3-4 ms</math>
* increase in temperature causes the <math>G_K</math> wave to catch up with the <math>G_{Na}</math> wave
* As increase temperature, both approach <math>\tau_M</math>. If waves go at same speed, cannot have action potential.
