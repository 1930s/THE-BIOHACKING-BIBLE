=Today's Agenda=
*Redo Overgrown Liquid Cultures
*Send for Sequencing
*Cut CPX and Backbone for ligation
*Start designing high copy backbone
*PCR off relevant portion of Mer operon from pto40 - Done
*Organize fridge - Done
*Design and order EC_20 Insert
*Email Isadora + Tom Knight for Meeting Times--Toan--Done
*Anneal FHUA Insert oligos - Done
*Understand Meinke Inducible System

=Status of Expected Parts=
# IDT Primers + Inserts - Arriving Today--ARRIVED
# CPX - At FedEx Facility in Boston
# FhuA - ARRIVED

==Sequencing of LC#1&2 from 3A==
*Miniprepped LC's of those colonies that grew only on Kan plates and not on Kan/Amp plates
*Sent in 4 samples, one forward and one reverse for each LC
*used 4 µl of DNA since each was approximately 30 ng/µl
*Order Number 8046

==Dilution of Ordered DNA==
*Made 100uM stocks of all IDT primers and single-stranded inserts
*Diluted 100uM stocks of primers/inserts into working stocks of 10uM concentration

==Annealing Complementary Primer Inserts==
*10 uL of 10 uM of oligo
*2 oligos - total volume 20 uL
*Mix with 80 uL water
*PCR Thermocycler Temperatures
*95 C
*Ramp down
*0.1 C/sec

==Phosphorylation of Primer Inserts==
*20 ul Annealed Oligo
*4 ul T4 DNA Ligase Buffer
*2 ul PNK (Kinase)
*14 H20
*37° - 1 hr, 65° - 20 mins

==Digestion of FhuA backbones==
*used PCR Purification kit to purify backbone

==Nanodrop of FhuA inserts/backbone==
*PICCS5 - 10 ng/ul
*PHIE6 - 5 ng/ul
*Insert- 650 ng/ul - instead just use rule of thumb .5 ul/20ng backbone

==Ligation of FhuA inserts/backbone==
*Mix 1: PHIE6
**.5 ul Ligase
**2 ul Ligation Buffer
**1.5 ul Insert
**10 ul Backbone
**6 ul  H20
*Mix 2: PICSS5
**.5 ul Ligase
**2 ul  Buffer
**1.5 ul Insert
**5 ul Backbone
**11 ul H20
