Hi Drew,

Sorry for the late response. I am traveling too much this summer. I will be happy to provide you with the constructs and genes that we have. Our E. coli colors range from yellow over purple to greenish.
If you want to access all the possible colors, you may need to swap the RBS's for tight gene expression - as you may remember from my talk, not one RBS seems to fit all biosynthetic genes.
Let me know which of the constructs you want.

Best,

Claudia

Hi Claudia,

Maybe the best thing to do would be to get one example of each of the obviously different colors (i.e., one yellow, one purple, and one greenish)?

Meanwhile, are these parts patented or, how do you feel about their use?  For example, it would let more people use them (and let students use them more easily) if I could define them as "parts" in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts (http://parts.mit.edu/).  But, to do this you would have to be OK with me entering the sequence information and having it online via the Registry website, et cetera.  Jut asking to make sure I don't overstep/get in trouble.

We just started a not-for-profit to try and make sharing of sequence information defining parts less trouble!
