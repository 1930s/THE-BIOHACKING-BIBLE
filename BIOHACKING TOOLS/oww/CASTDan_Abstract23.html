Abstract:

<br>High-throughput bioprocessing is a very promising
technique for bioprocess development and optimization
because of its high efficiency. The key to its development
has been the availability of simple and inexpensive sensors
to monitor the bioprocesses conducted in its small-scale
bioreactors. Here we report on a low-cost noninvasive CO2
sensing system suitable for any transparent vessel. The
system was composed of a CO2 sensing patch, a coaster,
an interface, and a computer. The sensing film was prepared
using the ion-pair technique. The coaster was a small
self-made device with necessary optics and electronics for
ratiometric measurements with a component cost of less
than $100. Results show that the system was stable and
reliable despite its simplicity and low cost. The sensitivity
of the CO2 sensing system was not affected by pH, media
type, or temperature. It was shown to be stable for at least
10 days, long enough for most bioprocesses.
