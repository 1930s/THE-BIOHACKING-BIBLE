==To Do==
*Retransform and plate RBS tester w/ RFP
*Sequence promoter tester w/ RFP
*Get part numbers for both
*design BB primers
*PCR T9002 and I2055

==Registry==
*The RBS tester with RFP (that we used to call blue) is I2056
*The promoter tester with RFP (used to call green) is I2057
*Nishant sent I2057 for sequencing
*To Recap: I2055 is the GFP RBS tester, E0240 is the GFP promoter tester, and T9002 is the output measurement tester (aka inverter, terminator, etc)

==BioBrick Primers==
*E0240 needs a BioBrick site b/t the plasmid and the RBS 
**Forward Primer should match B0032 and have a Spe1 tail
**Reverse Primers should have an EcoR1 tail and 1 should match 3K3 and the other 1AK3 
*I2055 needs a BioBrick site between the promoter and GFP 
**Fwd should match GFP (E0040) and have a Spe1 tail
**Rev should match R0040 and have an EcoR1 tail
*T9002 needs a BioBrick site between F2620 and B0032
**Fwd should match B0032 and have Pst1 tail
**Rev match Lux pR of F2620 and have EcoR1 tail

To insert BB sites. Format: 8-mer.restriction site.primer

    * E0240:
          o F (incl E0240, PstI): CTTAGTAG.ACTAGT.TCACACAGGAAAGTACTAGATGCG (53.1)
          o R (incl 3K3/1AK3, EcoRI): TCAGCGAT.GAATTC.CAGAAATCATCCTTAGCGAAAGC (54.2) 

    * I2057:
          o F (incl I2057, PstI): CTTAGTAG.ACTAGT.TCACACAGGAAAGTACTAGATGGC (52.1)
          o R: same as E0240 

    * I2055:
          o F (incl GFP, SpeI): CTTAGTAG.ACTAGT.ATGCGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTTTTC (52.4)
          o R (incl R0040, EcoRI): TCAGCGAT.GAATTC.GTGCTCAGTATCTCTATCACTGATAGG (52.0) 

    * I2056:
          o F (incl RFP, SpeI): CTTAGTAG.ACTAGT.ATGGCTTCCTCCGAAGACG (54.0)
          o R: Same as I2055 

    * For T9002:
          o F (incl lux pR, PstI): TCAGCGAT.CTGCAG.TCACACAGGAAAGTACTAGATGCG (53.1)
          o R (incl RBS, GFP,EcoRI) : CTTAGTAG.GAATTC.TTTATTCGACTATAACAAACCATTTTC (51.9)

==PCR==
*We did a 100ul preparatory PCR on T9002 at 54.5C
*PCRed I2055 on a gradient 41-51
*Diluted the new primers to 40uM
** I2055 shorter F - 918 ul water 
**I2055 shorter R - 801 ul 
**I2055 longer R - 867.5 ul
**T9002 R GFP - 801 ul
