== Coat Beads with Fibronectin. ==


# Take out beads solution 500ul of 10% beads (10 um), or 2 ml of 2.5% beads.
# Centrifuge to collect the beads and vacuum the supernatant. (6000 rpm,3-5 min)
# Wash 3 times with cold PBS (1 ml).
# Incubate with 50 ug/ml Fibronectin (or Fibrinogen)or 50 ug/ml goat IgG-RGD, 100 ug/ml concanavalin A, 100 ug/ml polylysine, 50 ug/ml antibodies, for 5X10<sup>7</sup> beads in cold PBS in 4C for O/N.
# Centrifuge and collect the beads.
# Incubate with cold 10 mg/ml BSA (1ml) in 4C for 3hr.
# Wash 3 times with cold PBS (1 ml). 
# Aliquote in 30 ul each (50 total number) and freeze in -20<sup>o</sup>C, each one should contain 2X20<sup>6</sup> beads.
 
Note: Steps 2-3, 4, 7-8 all should be kept in 4Â°C.
