Deok-Ho Kim received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Korea, in 1998 and the M.S. degree in mechanical design and production engineering from Seoul National University, Korea, in 2000. In 1996, he studied in the Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering at the University of Birmingham, UK, as a Hogil-Kim Memorial Fellow Exchange Student. During 1998-2000, he was a Research Assistant in the Institute of Advanced Machinery and Design, Seoul National University, Korea. He worked as a research scientist at the Microsystem Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Korea from March 2000 to June 2005. Between November 2003 and June 2004, he was a visiting research scientist, in Institute of Robotics and Intelligent Systems (IRIS), Swiss Federal Institute of Technology-Zurich (ETHZ) as a recipient of Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF) fellowship. He is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in biomedical engineering at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.

His most recent interests cover cellular BioMEMS and the use of lab-on-a-chips in quantitative systems biology studies, including nanopatterned biomaterials for cell and tissue engineering, systems biology approach to cellular mechanotransduction, and lab-on-a-chip devices for probing signal transduction and cell-cell communication.
