===MACS Assay w/o RFP cells - BL21DE3 cells vs his and strep OmpA1 cells (7/17/07)===

Purpose: To test binding with OmpA1 cells with a lower concentration of cells, using BL21DE3 with his and strep antibodies + beads as negative control.

#Followed [[IGEM:Harvard/2007/Protocols/Indirect Magnetic Labeling Protocol|Indirect Magnetic Labeling Protocol]]
##Used 10 ul of Strep/His and 10 ul of RFP Bacteria with 1000 ul of buffer
##Used 10 ul his antibodies and 15 ul strep antibodies
##Used 30 ul of Beads
##Added an extra wash step after step #5
#Then follow [[IGEM:Harvard/2007/Protocols/Magnetic Separation|Magnetic Separation]]
##Use the additional measures

===MACS Assay w/o RFP cells results (7/18/07)===

Results: There was a lot of background in our negative controls - the BL21DE3 cells that expected to have very little cells had a lot of cells.  Our OmpA1 contructs grew fairly well, but it's the negative control results that we are worried about, which was definetely not supposed to happen.

Conclusions: There may be protein interactions between the antibodies in other regions of the cells that we do not know of, which is causing binding in all of the other cells.  In any case, we should probably look to a different region, such as the AIDA1 cells that will be transformed and the loop region of OmpA1 that will be transformed later in the month.

===Electroporation of 10mer and 15mer ligation product into BL21(DE3) Cells===

#First attempted electroporation without doing PCR purification of ligation products. Electroporation s resulted in either arcing or no colonies formed.
#7/17/07 - PCR purification of remaining 10mer and 15mer ligation products
#Electroporation using 60 ng of 15mer, 60 ng of 10mer. 15mer had a time constant of 5.2/ 10mer had a time constant of 4.2

##Used 8 ul his antibodies and 20 ul strep antibodies
##Used 30 ul of Beads

===MACS Assay with AIDA1 results (7/20/07)===

Results: No growth at all<br>
Conclusion: Too little volume.  Will leave in incubator for another day to see if there is growth.

===MACS Assay Re-plate (7/20/07)===

Will replate with 300 ul bacteria

---------

===MACS Assay 2 results (7/21/07)===

Results: We had very little background, with about 200 white cells to about 5 red cells in each plate.  The smaller volume plates grew similarly after an extra day of incubation.
Conclusion: We finally have a construct that we can use that displays surface expression!
