==How to organize the Happy Hour==

===Location===
behind the Molecular Biology Building next to the dumpster  :(    -  feel free to try to get the Cafeteria again.

===to do:===
*order the beer keg 1 week in advance from the [http://www.bevmo.com/productlist.asp?N=168+41+4294956087&Nr=Store%3A50&area=beer& LaJolla BevMo] (858)729.0775 (either one or one and a half kegs depending on the weather) - DosEquis Lager is a popular choice - Fat Tire works well for half-kegs
*(preferably get another person to) buy Chips & Dips and Wines from Costco or the like (include paper plates & cups if we are out)
*hassle the president to send out an institute wide email to remind everyone of the happy hour


'''on the day: '''
*pick up keg and store it in a Cold room (Geza/Michael can be very helpful)
*make sure you know the lock combination and location of the SoF locker with unfinished stuff
*get it all on location at 10 to 5 (don't forget the ice)
*enjoy the beer
