If your tissue is relatively soft and small (eg; mouse kidney, liver, brain etc) then the tissue can be crushed in Cell Lysis Buffer using an eppendorf and pestle on ice.<br>
If you are dealing with larger or fibrotic tissue samples then these are best crushed using a mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen.

===Eppendorf and Pestle Tissue Disruption===
*  Remove tissue in eppendorf from -80 or liquid nitrogen and store on ice
* Add appropriate volume of ice cold Cell Lysis Buffer containing 1x Complete protease inhibitor (for embryonic mouse kidney 100uL is suitable)
* Crush tissue using pestle until tissue is completely pulverised taking care to keep it cold
* Incubate on ice for 5-10min
* Freeze cells at -80 degrees C
* Thaw cells on ice (these steps help disrupt cell membranes further)
* Spin tissue debris down at 13000rpm, 1min
* Aliquot supernatant protein lysate into usable aliquots and store at -80 degrees C (I usually load 7.5uL of protein lysate per well so aliquot slightly more than this to each tube to completely avoid any freeze/thawing of samples (causes protein degradation))
* Quantitate protein content of lysate (we currently use the BCA kit from Pierce)

===Mortar and Pestle Tissue Disruption using Liquid Nitrogen===
* Perform crushing in fumehood
* Pour liquid nitrogen into mortar until nearly full (to cool mortar)
* Tip tissue sample into liquid nitrogen
* Start crushing tissue sample with pestle.  Can help to tap tissue sample first to break up into smaller fragments.  Use circular grinding motion with pestle to crush sample to a powder before the liquid nitrogen completely evaporates.
* Very carefully add a small volume of liquid nitrogen to mortar (very carefully as don't want crushed tissue to shoot out of mortar)
* Pour crushed tissue and liquid nitrogen into suitable tube and store on ice
* Leave lid off until liquid nitrogen has evaporated
* Add appropriate volume of Cell Lysis Buffer containing 1x Complete protease inhibitor and pipette up and down to thoroughly resuspend tissue
* Incubate on ice for 30mins pipetting up and down occasionally
* Spin tissue debris down at 13000rpm, 1min
* Aliquot supernatant protein lysate into workable aliqots and store at -80 degrees C
* Quantitate protein content of lysate (we currently use BCA kit from Pierce)
