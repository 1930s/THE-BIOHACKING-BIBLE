==Organization Suggestions==

Think about these questions when preparing your project proposals for the group meeting.

For each project idea:

* What is the specific goal of the project?
** Alternate phrasing, courtesy of Kit Parker - what is the "deliverable?" The thing you will point to and say "this is our project?"
* What are two or three possible means of implementing the idea?
* Risk
** How many untested things have to work for the project to succeed?
** How will you test whether those things work or not?
** How will you adjust your plan when one of these things fails to work?
** How will you minimize the time/effort/resources lost to a failed design?
*** Can your time/effort/resources apply to more than one design simultaneously?
* Reward
** How cool, fun, exciting is the project for you?
** What if any is the usefulness or societal benefit of the project?
** What is going to impress the judges in November?
* Timeline
** What are the project milestones? (design, construction, testing)
** What is the estimated time required for each? (always overestimate)
** If you can't reach your ultimate goal by August, is there a satisfying intermediate goal?
** What is the immediate next step in pursuing the project?
*** If DNA synthesis will be required, how soon will you have the sequence designed?
