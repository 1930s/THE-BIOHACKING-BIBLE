==General==
*Cron searches <tt>/var/spool/cron</tt> for crontab files which are named after accounts in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>; crontabs found are loaded into memory.
*Cron also searches for <tt>/etc/crontab</tt> and the files in the <tt>/etc/cron.d/</tt> directory, which are in a different format

*When executing commands, any output is mailed to the owner of the crontab (or to the user named  in the <tt>MAILTO</tt> environment variable in the crontab, if such exists).

*Example cron file

 # use /bin/sh to run commands, no matter what /etc/passwd says
 SHELL=/bin/sh
 # mail any output to `paul', no matter whose crontab this is
 MAILTO=paul
 #
 # run five minutes after midnight, every day
 5 0 * * *       $HOME/bin/daily.job >> $HOME/tmp/out 2>&1
 # run at 2:15pm on the first of every month -- output mailed to paul
 15 14 1 * *     $HOME/bin/monthly
 # run at 10 pm on weekdays, annoy Joe
 0 22 * * 1-5   mail -s "It's 10pm" joe%Joe,%%Where are your kids?%
 23 0-23/2 * * * echo "run 23 minutes after midn, 2am, 4am ..., everyday"
 5 4 * * sun     echo "run at 5 after 4 every sunday"

*<tt>/etc/crontab</tt> - quick reference

==Syntax==

==Commands==

<tt>export EDITOR=vi</tt> - to specify a editor to open crontab file

*<tt>crontab -e</tt> - Edit your crontab file, or create one if it doesn't already exist.
*<tt>crontab -l</tt> - Display your crontab file.
*<tt>crontab -r</tt> - Remove your crontab file.
*<tt>crontab -v</tt> - Display the last time you edited your crontab file. (This option is only available on a few systems.) 

<tt>cron</tt> invokes the command from the user's HOME directory with the shell, (/usr/bin/sh).

==Environment==

cron supplies a default environment for every shell, defining:
*HOME=user's-home-directory
*LOGNAME=user's-login-id
*PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:.
*SHELL=/usr/bin/sh
