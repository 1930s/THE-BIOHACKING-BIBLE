Some quick notes on how I made this google earth tour video (so that I can do it again).

In [http://earth.google.com Google Earth]
#Set the disk cache size to 2000 MB (under Preferences->Cache)
#Set the Tour Pause to 0.5 seconds (under Preferences->Touring)
#View->Show Navigation->Never
#View->View Size->Computer Playback->640 x 480
#Hide the status bar

In [http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/ Snapz Pro X - 2.0.3]
#Cmd-shift-3 to launch
#Set the frame rate to 30 per second
#Check the option for smoother video which is more CPU intensive
#Press return to start recording
#Press Cmd-shift-3 to stop recording

You can use QuickTime Pro to trim a few seconds off the beginning.

==Future improvements==
#Have it show dialog boxes at each institution with descriptions and pictures of the labs.
#Somehow automate addition of labs to the kmz file.
#Do something like [http://www.mappr.com Mappr] in which it pulls in flickr photos that are tagged with openwetware and a latitude and longitude and displays them on a map.

==The file==
In case anyone wants to make a better version of this video ... here is the kmz file:  [[Media:OpenWetWare.kmz|OpenWetWare.kmz]].
