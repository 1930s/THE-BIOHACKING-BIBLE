'''Final Plasmid, Primer, Ligation Rxn, PCR reaction, and other DNA Stocks''' <br>
You can also document glycerol stocks or strains in this file if you have these.  <br>
The Stock Boxes are probably the safest in the large freezer near the door in room 5096. <br>  Glycerol stocks of cells should be stored in the -80 freezer.<br>
The Excel file contains placeholders for the following:<br>
1) Tube position in the box (1-81)<br>
2) Tube label<br>
3) What type of sample is in the tube (ie plasmid, PCR product, primer, etc)<br>
4) Desecription of the sample (ie promoter, vector type, selectable marker, etc)<br>
5) Sequence (either a link to the sequence on the wiki, or paste in the sequence directly, written 5' to 3')<br>
