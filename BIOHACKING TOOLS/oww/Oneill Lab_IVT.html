This is the protocol for Ambion's MAXIscript IVT kit.

==''In Vitro'' Trascription==
#Thaw transcription buffer and nucleotides. Vortex nucleotides and keep on ice. Keep transcription buffer at room temp.
#Assemble reaction at room temperature.
#*Spermidine in the transcription buffer can coprecipitate the template DNA if assembled on ice.
#*Do not add the transcription buffer until both water and template DNA are in the reaction tube.
#Incubate reactions at 37&deg;C for 10 minutes if radiolabelling or for 1 hour if using nonisotopic labels or unlabeled nucleotides.
#Add 1 &mu;L TURBO DNase 1
#Incubate at 37&deg;C for 15 minutes
#Add 1 &mu;L of 0.5M EDTA

==Cleaning up IVT product==
Following transcription it may be necessary to hydrolyze your probe or remove free nucleotides. For RNase protection assays or other experiments requiring only the full length probe, it is necessary to gel purify the IVT product. To remove unincorporated nucleotides proceed directly from DNase treatment to one of the following precipitation.

===Ammonium Acetate Precipitation===
#Bring reaction volume up to 50 &mu;L
#Add 5 &mu;L of 5M Ammonium Acetate and vortex
#Add 3 volumes of 100% ethanol (RNase free).
#Chill at -20&deg;C for at least 30 minutes.
#Spin for at least 15 minutes at max speed at 4&deg;C
#Remove supernatant and wash once with 70% ethanol.
#Resuspend pellet in 50 &mu;L of nuclease free water.
#Aliquot and store at -80&deg;C
#*There is no need to aliquot isotopically labeled transcripts since they degrade from radiolysis in 2-4 days

===Lithium Chloride Precipitation===
#Bring reaction volume to 40 &mu;L
#Add 5 &mu;L of 4M LiCl
#Add 140 &mu;L 100% ethanol
#Precipiate at -80&deg;C for 1 hour
#Spin for 20 minutes at max speed at 4&deg;C
#Remove supernatant and wash once with 70% ethanol.
#Resuspend pellet in 96 &mu;L DEPC treated water + 3 &mu;L RNAsin + 1 &mu;L 100mM DTT.
#Aliquot and store at -80&deg;C
