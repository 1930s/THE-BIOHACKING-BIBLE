==<bbpart>T9002</bbpart>: Transfer Function Characterisation & <bbpart>J37016</bbpart>/<bbpart>J37020</bbpart> Predator Cell Test Construct==



===Motivation===

The motivation behind this <bbpart>T9002</bbpart> test construct is to characterise the transfer function linking AHL input to GFP output.

This will allow us to construct a standard transfer function curve which will allow us to relate GFP output to an unknown AHL input, forming the basis of an AHL assay.

We also would like to explore the AHL input to GFP output in our predator cell constructs <bbpart>J37016</bbpart> and <bbpart>J37020</bbpart> (as it will directly link to AiiA and LuxR production in the predator cell).

===Materials & Equipment===

*Equipment
**Wallac Victor 3 Multi-Well Fluorimeter
**Eppendorf Tubes
**Small White Cap Tubes
**Large White Cap Tubes
**Gilson Pippettes
**37°C Shaker
**[[IGEM:IMPERIAL/Protocols/T9002_Report|T9002/J37016/J37020 Report Sheet]]

*Materials
**Dilution series of AHL [1000 {{uM}}, 100 {{uM}}, 10 {{uM}}, 5 {{uM}}, 1 {{uM}}, 500 nM, 100 nM, 50 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM] 
**GFP Standard Solution
**LB Medium with 40 {{ug}}/mL Ampicilin

===Protocol===
<showhide>
*Inoculate a culture from 10ul of stored T9002/J37016/J37020 in 2ml LB medium containing 50 {{ug}}/mL Ampicillin.
*Incubate at 37°C for overnight in a shaker. __HIDER__ 
<hide>
:<font color=green>This is to get a good stock of cells for use in the experiment. After the overnight culture the cells will be in stationary phase</font>
</hide>
</showhide>
*In the morning, prewarm 70 mL LB Amp medium in the 37°C water bath.
*Measure and record OD600 
<showhide>
*Inoculate a 16ml fresh culture from the o/n to bring back the OD600 to 0.1, use the prewarmed LB + Ampicilin in waterbath. __HIDER__

:Amount to dilute of T9002/J37016/J37020 culture = ________ mL (amount of original culture to use)

:Amount of prewarmed LB with Ampcilillin to use = ________ mL (16 mL - above result)

*Return LB to 37°C waterbath

*Incubate new culture at 37°C for 2 hours in a shaker __HIDER__

''After 2hrs in the shaker'':

<showhide>
*Dilute again for an OD of 0.1 in a new culture of 25ml of a prewarmed LB + Ampicilin. __HIDER__

:Amount of prewarmed LB with Ampcilillin to use = ________ mL (25 mL - above result)

*Vortex new T9002/J37016/J37020 culture.

*To start AHL incubation:
**Label each tube with AHL concentration
**Put 20ul of the AHL into 11 seperate 5ml white capped tubes
**Add appropriate amount of T9002 samples as per the table below
**Record time of inoculation in report sheet.
**Vortex each tube
<showhide>
:*Incubate all 5mL tubes in a 37°C shaker for 4 hours so GFP expression can reach steady state __HIDER__

''After 4hrs in the shaker'': 

*Add a 200uL sample from each eppendorf tube to the 96 well plate.
*Do this for 8 repeats following suggested patterning (see above)
**NOTE: Since all repeats are made from the same culture, it is enuogh to do 4 repeats - thus one plate can be used for 2 different tests. (Pipetting errors will be ruled out since absorbance is measured later and can then be considered when processing the data.)
*Add 4 x 200uL of growth medium to a well to act as a control.
*Take the plate and eppendorfs to BCHEM
<showhide>
*Add 995ul of ultra pure water to the eppendorf, together with 5ul of undiluted GFP standard solution and mix __HIDER__

Many thanks to Drew Endy and Barry Canton from MIT for providing the protocol on which this is based.

===Potential Issues===

*What is the GFP standard solution? Do we know its concentration? How stable is that? half life?
*<font color=red>JS:  Please can you write a protocol that will decouple other experiments with this one in case we want to assay an unknown concentration of AHL.  Thanks. (i.e. take an unknown concentration of AHL of x amount into the T9002....measure flourescence...etc)</font>
