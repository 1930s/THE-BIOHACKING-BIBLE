==To-do==
* <s>Miniprep the 15 ligation transformants we grew up yesterday (10 KaiA+bkb, 5 KaiB+bkb)</s>

==LacI<sup>q</sup> and J04450 (RFP insert)==
[[Image:2006-8-6 red plate.jpg|thumb|left|There appears to be constitutive RFP expression, despite the use of lacI<sup>q</sup>-carrying competent cells (Top10F')]]
<br style="clear:both;"/>
In today's meeting, George Church recommended putting lacI<sup>q</sup> on the plasmid.

==Gel purification of J04450, high-copy vector, and pSB4A3 low-copy vector==
We gel-purified the J04450, high-copy vector, and psB4A3 low-copy vector that we extracted from [[:Image:2006-8-6 digests of BB J04450 and pSB4A3.jpg|yesterday's gel]].

==Miniprep of 15 samples from the KaiA+bkb and KaiB+bkb transformation==
15 samples (KaiA+bkb 2-11, KaiB+bkb 2-6) miniprepped from 8uL of culture; made glycerol stock also. Both are sitting in their seperate containers in the freezer or -80 respectively. Nanodrop values varied from 10-20ng/uL - next time only grow in 2uL LB?

==Digest X-P to test ligation==
KaiA+bkb 1-11 and KaiB+bkb 1-6 were digested with X&P to see if the ligation worked or failed. The protocol based loosely on the Silver protocol, but assuming each sample has ~15ng/uL DNA, is:

* 19.25 uL DNA (~15 ng/uL gives 0.288ug DNA)
* 2 uL H<sub>2</sub>O
* 2.5 uL buffer (EcoRI buffer or Buffer 3)
* 0.5 uL enzyme 1 (XbaI)
* 0.5 uL enzyme 2 (PstI)
* 0.25 uL BSA

25 uL total volume.

MM:
*19x2=38 dh20
*19x2.5= 47.5 buffer 3
*19x0.5 = 9.5 XbaI
*19x0.5 = 9.5 PstI
*19x0.25 = 4.75 BSA
-----
pipet 5.75 into each.

==Ligation of J04450 + pSB4A3==
We iigated the gel-purified J04450 (\X-P) and pSB4A3 (\E-S) using the Roche rapid ligation kit.

Reaction:
* 2 uL pSB4A3
* 4 uL J04450
* 2 uL DNA dilution buffer (vial 2)
* 2 uL H<sub>2</sub>O
* 10 uL DNA ligation buffer (vial 1)
* 1 uL ligase (vial 3)

==Transformation of J04450 + pSB4A3 into Top10 and Top10F'==
We transformed the J04450 + pSB4A3 ligation into Top10 and Top10F' cells, to test for constitutive expression of RFP.

Transformations:
* 30 uL Top10 competent cells,  3 uL ligation
* 30 uL Top10F' competent cells, 3 uL ligation
* 10 uL Top10 competent cells, 1 uL positive control
* 10 uL Top10F' competent cells, 1 uL positive control
* 10 uL Top10 competent cells, 3 uL H<sub>2</sub>O
* 10 uL Top10F' competent cells, 3 uL H<sub>2</sub>O

Plated on 8 LB-carb plates: 1 for each of the controls, and 2 for each of the ligation transformations.

==Digests==

The digests that were completed earlier in PCR machines 1 and 2 (from earlier) were run for 2 hours with a 20 minute heat shock to inactivate the restriction enzymes.  

The digests were then run on 1% agarose gel that contained 20 lanes (25uL capacity)

===Analysis===

It seems like we got KaiA but not KaiB, from the digests above.  When the plasmids are cut with only one of the two restriction enzymes (due to a backwards insert in the vector), there should be a band about 3kb; that is seen in every lane.  Interestingly, KaiA (which is 855 bp) shows up on the gel as an 850 bp band, but the vector containing KaiA should have been 2 kb instead of 3 kb.  

Because we feel that we should analyze this further, we will wait until the morning to figure out what to do.
