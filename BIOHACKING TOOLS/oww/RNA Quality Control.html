== Quality control of RNA==

RNA Quality control
This protocol will assist you in performing RNA quality control for a variet of purposes; Microarray, real-time and Northern analysis.
 
==Checking RNA/cRNA samples on a nanodrop Spec==
*Check concentration, A260/A280, A260/A230 on [http://www.nanodrop.com/ Nanodrop] Spectrophotometer.
*Maintain the A260/A280 ratio close to 2.0 for pure RNA (ratios between 1.9 and 2.1 are acceptable).
*For Affymetrix labeling reactiosns; concentrations of cRNA are generally around 1000-1500ng/µl for a 40µl IVT reaction using 20µl of cDNA template.

==Checking RNA/cRNA samples on an agilent bioanalyzer==
Agilent  [http://www.chem.agilent.com/Scripts/PDS.asp?lPage=51 BioAnalyzer] Gel electrophoresis of the RNA is done to estimate the quality of the RNA. The bioanalyzer software produces a RIN (RNA integrity number) this gives a measure of sample quality that is not subjective. Howver it needs to be used with some caution and is not as useful as it sounds.

The following are examples of typical Human RNA examined on an Agilent 2100 BioAnalyser.
RNA electropherograms have different profiles depending on species, tissue and starting material quality.

==Checking RNA/cRNA Samples on a denaturing formaldehyde gel==
I still need to add a formaldhyde gel protocol, anyone else got one?
