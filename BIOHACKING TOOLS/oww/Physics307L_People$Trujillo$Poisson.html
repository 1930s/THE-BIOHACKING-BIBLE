== POISSON ==

'''Definition'''

The Poisson Distribution is a discrete distribution which takes on the values X = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... . It is often used as a model for the number of events (such as the number of telephone calls at a business or the number of accidents at an intersection) in a specific time period. It is also useful in ecological studies, e.g., to model the number of prairie dogs found in a square mile of prairie.

The Poisson distribution is determined by one parameter, lambda. The distribution function for the Poisson distribution is :

<math>f(k;\lambda)=\frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!},\,\!</math>

Where 
<math>\lambda</math> is the amount of successes in a given period and <math>k</math> is the amount of ocurances.

'''Data'''

[[Image:Poisson-animate.gifâ€Ž |thumb|40ms Dwell Time]]

We took data using a Multichannel Analyzer (MCA)which detects the amount of events occurring in a particular time period. Each channel represents the number of bins in time. The RAW data is found [[Media:Poisson.zip|here]]

'''Summary'''

Well, at first i was thinking that this experiment was going to be easy but it turns out that the majority of the lab is not taking the data but analyzing the data. I originally thought that I would have time to cook up snazzy LabVIEW program that would display all the distributions it  an animated mode and a "single shot" mode but. I got some insight from Tomas on house exactly this is supposed to work being that he went above and beyond on the analysis.
