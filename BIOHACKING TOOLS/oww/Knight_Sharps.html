==Types of waste==

*Anything sharp including pipets, pipet tips, needles and razor blades.  It's okay if these items are contaminated with biologicals since the contents of the sharps containers are incinerated.  
*You can also dispose of sharps in the red plastic sharps containers.  When this container is full, place it in the gray sharp containers.
*Sharps contaminated with chemicals should go in a separate container and be disposed of as chemical waste.

==Disposal==

Place in labeled grey sharps container bins (one in [http://www.csail.mit.edu/resources/maps/3/306.gif 32-306] and [http://www.csail.mit.edu/resources/maps/3/322.gif 32-322]).  For those areas not near the large sharps containers, small plastic sharps containers are used.  These can be closed and deposited directly in the large grey sharps container bins.

==When the container is full==

Use a plastic tie to lock the container shut and place it in the 3D lobby (where the elevators are) on Wednesday evening for pickup Thursday morning.  Email biosharps@mit.edu and request a pickup giving them the lab name and the location of the waste container.  Since we are not a regular stop for them, it may take a couple of emails before they pick up the full sharps container and deliver an empty one.
