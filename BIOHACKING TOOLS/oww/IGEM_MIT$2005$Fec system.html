'''System Description'''
*Why we choose Fec:
:+ Conformational change
:+ FecA, major component of the pathway, is an outermembrane protein
:+ Fec pathway is non-essential
:+ Well-understood pathway

*Our design:
:+ System level: animation of how system is supposed to work
:+ Device level: diagram with explanation

*Questions we address:
**Engineering/design of system:
:+ internal fusion - image of FecA protein bound & unbound
:+ signal transmission - flourescein --> PoPs --> expression of RFP
:+ genes under polycistronic control 
:+ external linker added to anti-flourescein scFv
**Science of the system:
:+ fusion positions - images of main 6, mention 17 total due to variation 
:+ knock out of native Fec system

'''Status'''
*Progress:
:+ device diagram of what parts are built and/or tested
:+ results: data, graph, gel, microscope images
:+ conclusions from present state of project: 
::# FecA Promoter-RFP is induced by iron
::# 

"What's left" is if project is not finished. If we've done building and tested system right away for its function and doesn't work, "Analysis of why system doesn't work."  
*What's needed to be done:
:+ parts to build/test
:+ problems to solve
:+ characterization of parts

*Analysis of why system doesn't work: 
:+ what could be the problems:
::- conformational change wasn't induced
::- no binding of flourescein  
::- scFv wasn't expressed 
::-
Base on analysis above, "What's needed to be done" will be changed to tests that confirm/refute 
the causes above.

'''''Questions for input'''''
# other engineering questions?
# other scientific questions?
# data? transfer curve? FACS data? Building data vs. testing data
# under "what's left," characterization of parts overlapse with Jessica's direction.
