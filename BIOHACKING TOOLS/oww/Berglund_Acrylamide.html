==10% RNA Denaturing Polyacrylamide Gel==

==Materials==
Total volume= 75ml<br>
<br>
18.75ml of 40% 19:1 acrylamide:bis acrylamide<br>		
7.5ml 10xTBE buffer			<br>			
31.5g of Urea (fc=7M: 60MW* 0.075L*7M)<br>
add water to 75ml<br>
<br>
Loading dye:<br>						
200µl 1% Bromophenol blue<br>						
200µl 1% xylene cyanol<br>						
500µl formamide	<br>					
100µl 10XTBE<br>	
<br>
Glass plates: Need (1) 8 inch x 6 1/2 inch glass plate plate and (1) 7 inch x 6 1/2 inch glass plate (each 1/8 inch thick)<br>
teflon spacers and combs that are .75mm thick<br>
<br>

==Methods==
*This is for a small gel<br>					
*Place spacers between plates, clamp with clamps making sure spacers touch each other<br>
*Mix 150µl AP and 25µl of TEMED into the premade gel base.<br>
*Pour	<br>					
*Place comb into plate.  Wait for gel to polymerize (30 min)<br>
<br>				
*remove bottom spacer from plates<br>				
*place into gel apparatus and tighten down<br>	
*fill resevoirs with 1XTBE buffer		<br>			
*Blow out bottom of gel where spacer was with bent needle to remove bubbles, blow out wells carefully<br>
*Run at 250V-300V (15W) for 30 min or until gel warms up	<br>
*While gel is running prepare the samples	<br>
*Add 5µl of dye to 5µl of sample<br>	
*Add 5µl of dye to 5µl RNA standards of your choice<br>	
*Denature sample and standards for 10 min at 100° C	<br>
*Cool on ice 3 min	<br>					
*Stop running gel (no voltage should go through the gel while you are loading)<br>
*Blow out wells with straight needle to remove urea	<br>
*Load samples	<br>					
*Run at 250V-300V until you are satisfied (sometimes longer sometimes shorter) <br>
*Remove gel from apparatus<br>
