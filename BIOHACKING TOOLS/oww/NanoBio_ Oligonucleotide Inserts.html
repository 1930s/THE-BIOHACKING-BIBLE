== Design of oligonucleotide inserts==

*The sense oligo should be of the form:<br> 5' '''CTAG'''A(coding sequence)ACTAGTAGCGGCCGC'''TGCA''' 3'<br> The bolded sequences will be the overhanging "sticky" ends.
*The anti-sense oligo should be of the form:<br> 5' GCGGCCGCTACTAGT(reverse complement of coding sequence)T 3'
*Design considerations.  Make sure that:
**either primer will not form a stable internal hairpin structure, &Delta;G < -3 kcal/mole
**either primer does not contain a EcoRI, PstI, SpeI, XbaI, NotI, or BstEII site outside of the flanking regions
**the insert for the forward primer does not begin with TC (or else a DAM I site (GATC) is formed, the A is methylated and XbaI cannot cut at its site)
*Order 100 nmol DNA oligo with 5' phosphorylated ends and PAGE purification from [http://www.idtdna.com IDT].
*Note: if you're feeling stingy or in a rush and your oligo insert is small ~30 bp, you can skip PAGE purification and the insert will still [[likely]] be okay. For longer inserts, PAGE purification is highly recommended.

== Hybridize ssDNA to form ds insert (start here if you ordered phosphorylated oligos(right move!))==
*Mix:
**3 uL 100 µM sense oligo
**3 uL 100 µM anti-sense oligo
**3 uL 10 x PNK (polynucleotide kinase) buffer (in common buffer stocks)
**3 uL 0.5 M NaCl
**18 uL distilled water
to give 30 µL total volume

*Place in boiling water bath for 2 min., then remove water bath from the heat source and allow the DNA (still in the water bath) to cool to room temperature.
*1x PNK buffer (NEB catalog # B0201S) contains: 70 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM Dithiothreitol, pH 7.6.

== Phosphorylation of 5' ends & hybridization (only if you didn't order 5'phosphorylated oligos) ==
*Note: it is really just better in terms of time & efficiency to order 5' phosphorylated oligos. Really.
*Mix:
**3 uL 100 µM sense oligo
**3 uL 100 µM anti-sense oligo
**3 uL 10 x PNK (polynucleotide kinase) buffer
**2 uL 10mM ATP
**2 uL T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK)
**17 uL distilled water
to give 30 uL total volume
*Incubate at 37C for 1.5 hours.
*Add 4 uL 0.5 M NaCl.
*Place in boiling water bath for 2 min., then remove water bath from the heat source and allow the reaction (still in the water bath) to cool to room temperature.
