==AHL titration curve for infector detector construct==
*The '''aim'' of this experiment was to test the pTet-luxR-pLux-GFPmut3b construct with a range of AHL concentrations. A titration curve could then be created for the construct in terms of AHL concentrations
*The materials and methods can be found in the [[Imperial/Wet Lab/Protocols/ID3.1|Protocols]]
*The concentrations of AHL for which the construct was tested are: 0nM, 5nM, 10nM, 15nM, 20nM, 50nM, 100nM, 1000nM
*There were two negative controls for the experiment:
**Empty vector with [AHL]=1000nM
**pTet-luxR-pLux-GFPmut3b construct with [AHL] = 0nM
*The [[Imperial/Wet Lab/Results/ID3.1|Results]] showed that the total fluorescent output produced by the construct increases with increasing [AHL]
