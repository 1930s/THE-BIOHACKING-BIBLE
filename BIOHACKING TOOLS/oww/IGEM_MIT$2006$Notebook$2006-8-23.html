Things done today off the top of my head:

1. Miniprepped the 30.bat2.30.thi3 mutants, the pchba.term mutants, and the osmY.inverter.xxx structures.

2. Digested both the 30.bat2.30.thi3 mutants and pchba.term mutants and ran on a gel.

3. Ligated and transformed the correctly cut pchba.terms with rbss.

4. Analyzed and graphed the osmY.E0840 results.  It was a huge success.

5. Glyceroled the pseudomonas strain, the correct smelling indole-knockouts, and the top10 osmY.inverter.xxx structures.

6. Transformed the osmY.inverter.xxx structures into recently-made competent indole-knockout cells.
