==Plan==

===General===
* GOAL: Use MedStory (currently in beta - features and XML parsing may change) to deliver info that a newly-diagnosed user would be interested in seeing:
** Drugs and substances of interest
** Procedures
** Drugs in clinical studies
** Clinical trials

* Other possible information we should consider showing the patient:
** Experts
** Research centers
** Genes

===Possible Issues===
** Is it somewhat ethically suspect to simply swipe these things (even if they're credited) from MedStory?
** The format of MedStory does have XML-based (and thus, easily Python-parsable) sections, including News and Clinical Trials, but it doesn't have it for the bar-graphed items, which include information we really want to present to the user.

==Tiff's Plan/Work==
* Will try to figure out:
** Drugs
** Clinical trials

==Deniz's Plan/Work==
* Will write a function to retrieve
** Useful links (a more 'respectable' stable of sites)
** Scholarly information links.
