*The core-conductor equation: <math>\frac{\partial^2 V_m(z,t)}{\partial z^2}=(r_o+r_i)K_m(z,t)-r_oK_e(z,t)</math>
* action potential in neurons
** spatial extent
*** positive membrane potential for about 1ms
*** speed of propagation about 30 m/s
*** over a space of about 30 mm (large)
** transmembrane current is inward at action potential peak
** transmembrane current is outward ahead of action potential peak
*** outward current hels depolarize membrane and can help AP to propagate
*** but same logic would have AP propagating in other direction also (if it weren't refractory)
* dependence of speed on geometry
** AP, <math>k_e=0</math>
** <math>\frac{\partial^2 V_m(z,t)}{\partial z^2}=(r_o+r_i)K_m(z,t)</math>
** <math>\frac{1}{\nu^2}\frac{\partial^2 V_m(z,t)}{\partial t^2}=(r_o+r_i)2\pi a J_m</math>
*** we converted <math>K_m</math> (per length) to <math>J_m</math> (per area)
** <math>\frac{\frac{\partial^2 V_m(z,t)}{\partial t^2}}{J_m}=\nu^2(r_o+r_i)2\pi a = C</math>
*** this is a constitutive relationship
*** right hand side is constant and independent of the network topology
** <math>\nu = \sqrt{\frac{C}{(r_o+r_i)2\pi a}}</math>
** we can determine how the speed of an action potential depends on <math>r_i, r_o, a</math>, e.g. increasing external resistance slows AP
** a '''space clamp''' shorts the internal resistance with a wire so that <math>r_i=0</math>. As the external resistance is usually very small, the speed of the action potential becomes very large (thus changing the cell to be 1D)
** Assume external resistance is small, <math>r_i = \frac{\rho}{A} = \frac{\rho}{\pi a^2}</math>, so <math>\nu = \sqrt{\frac{Ca}{2\rho}} \propto \sqrt{a}</math>
*** this only holds true for unmyelinated neurons
* can also infer transmembrane potential using the outside potential (which is easier to measure)
** <math>v_o(z)=-\frac{r_o}{r_o+r_i}(v_m(z) - V_m^o)</math>
