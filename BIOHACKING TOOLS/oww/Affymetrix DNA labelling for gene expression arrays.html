Miscellaneous Reagents


==Protocol==

=== BioPrime Random Genomic DNA Labeling Protocol ===
Extract DNA from a single leaf of each of 4 Columbia and 4 Ler plants using Qiagen DNA easy plant prep kit and re-suspended in 100ul. To extract equal amount of DNA from the 50 â€“ 100 mutant or wild type F2 plants, take 1 leaf (or equal amount of tissue) from each plant and freeze together in liquid nitrogen.  Grind tissue together and use ~100mg powder in the Qiagen DNA easy kit.  Resuspend DNA in 100ul.

Total labeling reaction volume is 150ul

add
~30ul (300ng) Plant DNA
60ul 2.5X random primers (Bioprime kit).
to 132ul with H20 (~42ul)

Denature at > 95C for 5-10minutes, then cool on ice.

add
15ul 10X dNTPs mix with Biotin dCTP
3ul Klenow polymerase enzyme

Incubate overnight @ 25C (room temp).  This results in small labeled products about 50bp (Figure 1). 

add
15ul 3M NaOAc
400ul cold 100% EtOH
spin, remove supernaunt, and wash with
500ul cold  75% EtOH
resuspend in 
100ul water

=== Labeling QC ===
Use 5ul to check yield and quality on a gel (Figure 1).

All bands should be close to the same intensity.

=== Hybridisation ===
The labeled DNA is then treated the same as labeled cRNA in standard hybridization protocols for gene expression, see Eukaryotic Target Preparation Pg 51 [https://www.affymetrix.com/Download/manuals/expression_ever_manual.pdf] Briefly.

95ul Labeling reaction
3.3ul Control Oligo B2 (3nM)
10 ul Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (optional)
2ul Herring Sperm DNA (10mg/ml)
2ul Acetylated BSA (50mg/ml)
110ul 2X hybridization buffer

Final Volume ~225ul Heat Denature >95C for 5 minutes, then cool Replace 1X hyb solution in pre wetted warmed chips. with 200ul (of ~225ul) labeled hybridization cocktail. Hybridize overnight @ 45C with rotation 60rpm. Wash and double stain with antibody.
