OpenPBS is a GPL'd batch queuing system. In brief,
both the [Beowulf] and the [Roadrunner] clusters use
OpenPBS to distribute compute-jobs across their several
nodes.


==Common OpenPBS Commands==

* '''qsub''' -- submit a compute-job for execution
* '''qstat''' -- query status of the queues
* '''qdel''' -- remove a (possibly running) compute-job

==UnCommon OpenPBS Commands==

* '''offline-node''' -- a simple shell wrapper to [pbsnodes]
* '''pbsnodes''' -- maintain which compute-nodes participate the queuing system
* '''for i in `qstat | grep ''<username>'' | awk -F. '{print $1}'` ; do qdel $i ; done''' -- delete all submitted jobs run by <username>
* '''checknode ''<nodename>''''' -- check node with name <nodename>
* '''diagnose -n | grep -v nonspeedy''' -- look at all speedy nodes
* '''tracejob ''<jobid>''''' -- look at the history of a particular job with ID <jobid> that was run
* '''diagnose -p''' -- show priorities

==Other Important Queuing Bits==

* '''qstat -q''' -- What queues exist? 
* '''showstart''' -- When will my job run?
* '''fairshare''' -- What is the amount my group's cluster usage?
* '''showq''' -- show jobstart order

==How to manage job output==

* email
* stdout and stderr
