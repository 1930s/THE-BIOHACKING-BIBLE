==Cell Velocity Measurements==

I've been trying to figure out statistics on cell motion.

Using ImarisXT combined with MATLAB - I can get all sorts of statistics out of cell tracking.  I use Spots and Spot Tracking in Imaris to track the cells - then take the numbers into MATLAB and analyze them.

I have found that the cell statistics seem to follow a Poisson distribution.  I think it's due to the discrete nature of cell binding events, or possibly protrusion events.
