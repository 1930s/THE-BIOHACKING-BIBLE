The '''Bac-to-Insulin''' (''"Back to Insulin"'') project focuses on the problem faced by type 1 diabetes sufferers. The system will monitor the glucose levels in the blood and secrete the appropriate amount of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin insulin] required. This has great advantage over the current methods of insulin administration. First of all, there will be continuous regulation of the insulin dosage and secondly the whole system is long lasting. Current methods require administration of insulin quite frequently throughout the day whereas our system can operate efficiently for up to 4 days.
