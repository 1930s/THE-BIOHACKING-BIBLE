As the field of environmental microbiology grows it is clear that microbes represent the not-so-silent majority of life on earth, balancing the biochemical and geochemical budgets and the basis for support of all life on the planet. The fact that things so small can influence processes so big has always fascinated me. My interests are unified by the overarching questions: “What are the in situ selective pressures on microbial life?” and “How does this network of microorganisms determine environmental stoichiometry and influence higher planetary processes?”

Many key processes in the nitrogen cycle, including ammonia oxidation, nitrite oxidation, nitrogen fixation and denitrification, are unique to Bacteria and Archaea. As a post-doctoral researcher in the [[DeLong Lab]] I have recently employed genomic and bioinformatic tools to investigate nitrification in the marine environment.  

Nitrification is an aerobic, two-step process performed by separate microbes, where ammonium is oxidized to nitrite by beta or gamma-proteobacterial groups and nitrite is further oxidized to nitrate by discrete members of the alpha-, gamma-, or delta-proteobacteria, or Nitrospira species. Until recently, the only microbes known to be capable of autotrophic ammonia oxidation were specific clades found within the beta and gamma-proteobacteria. Several new lines of evidence, however, have suggested a role for marine planktonic crenarchaea in the autotrophic oxidation of ammonia.

To further characterize microbial nitrification in the marine environment, picoplankton genomic libraries were screened from coastal and open ocean habitats to identify putative nitrifying genes and small-subunit ribosomal phylotypes. Data from this work, together with quantitative PCR assays, suggest ammonia monooxygenase gene-containing planktonic crenarchaea are much more abundant than any known ammonia oxidizing bacteria. Additionally, nitrifying crenarchaea could be more phylogenetically diverse than previously observed and they may have potential interactions with co-occurring Nitrospina (a genus of delta-proteobacteria and obligate nitrite oxidizer) in the marine environment.

Our observations add to a picture of nitrification in the marine environment where dominant members of the marine crenarchaea are potentially responsible for the bulk of ammonia oxidation. Completing this oxidative process, Nitrospina-related bacteria, and potentially other groups, scavenge the nitrite evolved and replenish the nitrate pool. Further investigation into the dynamics and activities of ammonia oxidation, its relationship with anammox metabolism in oxygen limited environments, and the production and fate of nitrite in the environment will enable better understanding of this crucial nutrient forcing mechanism.

Most recently, my work has involved heterologous expression of enzymes from environmental DNA libraries to investigate the degradation cell wall material in the marine environment. Bacterial cell wall components comprise a major portion of dissolved organic matter in the ocean and study of their composition and degradation will gain insight into the balance of this significant standing stock of carbon on our planet.
