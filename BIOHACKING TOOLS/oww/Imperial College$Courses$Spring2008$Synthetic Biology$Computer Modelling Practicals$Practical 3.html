</font><br>
</div>


In [[...|Practical 2]], we have explored how gene expression can be controlled (positively or negatively) by other proteins. Here, we start to assemble genetic circuit by connecting genes. The model studied here is a simple genetic cascade, where a Gene_1 produces a protein which repressed the expression of Gene_2. Additionally, you are able to induce the expression of Gene_1 thanks to an inducer.
 
To start, launch the CellDesigner Application: Double Click on the Icon found on your Desktop.
Then follow the instructions below to build the model.

'''Questions:'''
* Using the default kinetics parameters, build the following 3 transfer functions:
** first, between the [inducer] concentration, and the Protein_1 steady-state expression level. Take the inducer level to vary between [0, 10000]. Comment on the behaviour observed (Illustrations)
** second, between the Protein_1 concentration (to be kept constant during the simulations), and the Protein_2 steady-state expression level. Make sure that the range covered by the concentration of Protein_1 helps to explore the full dynamic range of system behaviour.
** third, between the [inducer] concentration, and the Protein_2 steady-state expression level. Take the inducer level to vary between [0, 10000]. Comment on the behaviour observed (Illustrations)
* We want to tune this cascade so that when using our maximal [inducer] concentration we are able to completely shut-down the expression of Protein_2. Suggest 2 independent strategies to achieve that result.

'''Questions:'''
* Focus on the modelling section of the published paper, and build your own 'Repressilator' model in CellDesigner.
* Run a simple sensitivity analysis on each parameter, and suggest some strategies to control the amplitude of the oscillations.
* Do the same to suggest ways to control the frequency of the oscillations.
* '''Bonus''': Could you explain the drift observed on the experimental data ? Provide a simulation supporting your hypothesis.

'''Questions:'''
* Suggest a strategy to characterise this model (Establish clear simulation scenarii to illustrate the properties of this genetic circuit. Tip: The cell designer function related to 'Change Amount' might be handy)
* From your characterisation, how would you call this device ? 
* Imagine an application where this genetic device would be useful.
