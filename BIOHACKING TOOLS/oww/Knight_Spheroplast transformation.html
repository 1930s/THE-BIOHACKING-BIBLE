==Overview==
This protocol is used to transform yeast with large DNA molecules, creating a YAC.  It requires digesting away the cell wall, leaving the yeast "spheroplast" behind.  The spheroplasts and the high molecular weight DNA are both very fragile - be warned, this one's fussy.  If you've never done it before, we recommend reading the chapter by Green first.

Technique is still in beta testing.  We are using the recombination-based cloning method of Spencer to create the YAC ''in vivo''.  This version is scaled to produce 10 plates' worth of transformants, and incorporates some modifications, mostly from Kouprina.

==Materials==

*DNA
**[[Knight:Bacterial genome extraction|Source material for YAC]  -- warning: requires several days
**Linearized YAC precursor plasmids, pRML1 and pRML2 -- see Spencer

*Yeast culture
**Strain in use is J57D (trp- ura-)
**Log-phase overnight culture, 100 mL at ~2 x 10^7 cell/mL (OD660 of 2-4)
**Kouprina gives the OD660 for 1/10 dilution in water as 0.14

*Stable media (can prepare in advance)
**YPD (100 mL)
**Sterile H2O (60 mL)
**1 M sorbitol (40 mL + ~5 mL)
**SCE (40 mL)
**2 M DTT (200 uL)
**Lyticase (approx. 1000 U)


*Unstable media (prepare from sterile solutions right beforehand)
