The way to recycle technotrash through TechnoCycle is
to mail it to "Recycling, Building NW62" via interdepartmental mail.

If your technotrash doesn't fit in an interdepartmental envelope, it's almost
certainly inappropriate for TechnoCycle, which is for batteries, media,
hard drives, and portable electronics like cellphones. If you have a
(deactivate) display, computer, or larger item, consider posting it to
reuse@mit.edu or see the instructions for recycling here:
