=== making plates for the moss ===
====11/05/07====
* using normal agar (1%)
* wanted plates with "notches" (coated for mammalian cells)
* using Tomato Plant Food Miracle-Gro at 160 mg / 100 ml
** seems to contain the same chemicals as reccd. in the [http://biology4.wustl.edu/moss/Mediarecipes.pdf moss media recipes pdf](but what concentrations? see below for jason's digital cocktail napkin analysis)


====mirace gro calculations====
N (nitgoren) -
Nitrogen is 14/100 of the molecular weight of KN03, so since you

need 1.01 g of KN03 in 1L, then we need 140mg of N in 1L.  Since

the MiracleGro is 24% N (w/w) we need to add 140mg/0.24 = 583mg

of Miracle Gro to 1L.

In this miracle gro the N is in ammonium and urea where we would
prefer it in N03 (or at least that would comply with the protocol).

P04 (phosphate) -
Have to correct for MW from Miracle Gro since it has P205.  We

need 130mg of P205, and it is 8% P205 (w/w) in the miracle gro.

1.6g of Miracle Gro to 1L.

Fe (Iron) -
1.67g of miracle gro for the Fe by the same analysis.

Mg (Magnesium)
- we don't have it.

So we'll have to give 2X the nitrogen.

So we'll add 1.6g to 1L
- major problem is we're missing the Magnesium.

WE'll be doing 100ml to start so 160mg.
