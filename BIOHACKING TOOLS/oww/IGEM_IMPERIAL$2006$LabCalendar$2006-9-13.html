 <u>'''TO DO:'''</u>
 *Maxi & Mini of J37024 (11/9) 
 *Mini T9002, (J37019)
 *Biosensor Testing (Enzyme Activity) & J37016 for this
 *J37015 & J37015RS Testing
 *Ligation & Electroporation of J37022, J37025 & Cre/Lox into plasmid
 *(Culture J37024 from 12/9 for maxi, mini & storage)
 </font color>


==Testing of J37015 & J37015 RS==
#Measuring OD of culture every hour in order to establish growth curve
#Diluting cultures every 2 hrs in order to keep LuxR levels low, so that the positive feedback loop is not kicked off yet

==Miniprep of T9002 and J37024(Ligation from Dr. Mann)==

*PROBLEM: The gel did not seem to be correctly made as it did not appear to be smooth, rather, there were bits of solidified agarose visible after is was run. 
*Miniprep results do not show expected parts but this might be due to above problem.

==Ligation of J37024 with new stop codon==
*J37024 = J37023 + 1A   or    J37024 = J37023 + 1G
*NOTE: Maxiprep of 1A and 1G were done straight from the plasmid DNA from the Registry's plate
