'''Ernie's Al Fresco''' is a food truck that frequents the Caltech campus...it's by Spalding (the post office, not where we work) in the morning, by the Physical Plant around lunch, and by Braun in the early afternoon.  Ernie's is most popular around lunch time - he usually pulls in around 11:30am and sticks around until about 1:00pm.  He's got all kinds of menu items (affordably priced between three or five dollars), ranging from burritos to sandwiches to wraps to salads.  He even has drinks - small ones (cans) are 50 cents and big ones (bottles) are a dollar.  Because Ernie's is so popular, sometimes there's a wait.  But the food is always quickly prepared - once you order, you're never more than a few minutes away from lunchtime bliss.

**Potato tacos - imagine potatoes the consistency of hash browns (or maybe tater-tots) forming a thin layer inside a handmade corn tortilla, folded in half and deep-fried to golden brown perfection, and served with guacamole and sour cream.  At the first bite the delicate crunch of the tortilla gives way to the subtle, yet substantive, seasoning of the potato inside.  Nothing comes closer to lunchtime heaven on a sunny southern California day. [[User:Tsbayer|Tsbayer]]

==Community Outreach==
Ernie is known for his generous support of the local community. As a highlight, Ernie is the unofficial sponsor of the ChE soccer team that plays in the internationally-popular Caltech intramural B soccer league. The team is named after its sponsor's name-sake: Ernie's AF. Come see them play next fall: Saturdays on the North field!
