"The student should prepare a 30-minute presentation. The Oral Exam Committee members will have read 
and thought about the Proposal ahead of time.  Given that the meeting lasts up to two hours, there will be 
ample time for questions/discussion during your presentation.  If questions arise about the format or style of 
the presentation, the student should contact the Oral Exam Committee Chair.  The student should expect to 
be examined in depth on subject matter directly and tangentially related to all aspects of the Proposal.  The 
questioning need not be restricted to the Proposal itself, but may expand into areas impinging on the 
Thesis topic. 

One or two days before the presentation, the student should pick up from the BE Academic Office a yellow 
“Verification of Oral Presentation” form.  The Committee Chair must complete this form to confirm the 
outcome of a Thesis Proposal/Oral Exam Presentation, Progress Report, or Thesis Defense.  The 
completed Verification form should be submitted to the Academic Office. From there, copies will be 
distributed to the student, the advisor, and the Committee Chair.  If the Proposal presentation is acceptable, 
a “Pass” grade will be recorded for BE.951"
