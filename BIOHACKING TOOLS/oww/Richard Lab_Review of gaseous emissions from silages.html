| Porter, M. G. , Murray, R. S. 2001. The volatility of components of grass silage on oven drying and the inter-relationship between dry-matter content estimated by different analytical methods  Grass and Forage Science 56 (4), 405–411. 
|| Upon oven drying some grass dry matter is volatilized. True DM (dry matter) content is one that's corrected for the volatilization amount, based on volatilization coefficients. This study can be used to learn of the main VOC (volatile organic acids) that are emitted from grass silages, and the relative proportions in which they are emitted. The table below shows the grass silage's content in ammonia, alcohols, and 4 volatile acids.Lactic acid volatility coeffcients at 60°C, 85°C and 100°C  were 0.090, 0.224 and 0.375. Volatile fatty acid volatility coeffcients at 60°C, 85°C and 100°C  were 0.554, 0.716 and 0.892. The volatilities of ammonia and total alcohols were not temperature dependent. Absolute dry matter (GCDM), alcohol-corrected toluene dry matter (ATDM) and volatile-corrected oven dry matter (VCODM) contents based on drying temperatures of 100, 85 and 60 deg C. Silage dry matter in western Europe ranges from 153 to 365 g / kg (oven dry-matter content at 100°C). Gas-liquid chromatography was used to determine the amount of volatile fatty acids in liquid silage extracts

|| silage samples are also analyzed for water content, to give an absolute dry-matter content (GCDM) according to the method of Porter and Barton (1997). Alcohol corrected toluene dry matter (ATDM) is considered to be the sum of toluene dry matter, ethanol and propanol.

|| HPLC is used to analyze liquid silage extract for Dicumarol. 1 g samples are extracted in 1,2-dichloroethane/phosphate buffer. The extract is purified through a silica column. Next, reversed-phase HPLC chromatography is performed using a sodium acetate/methanol(25:75) eluent, and UV wavelength of 303 nm for detection.
