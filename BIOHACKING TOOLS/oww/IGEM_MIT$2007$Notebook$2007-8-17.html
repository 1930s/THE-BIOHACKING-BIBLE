==Agenda==
#Transform R0051 into BL21
#Transform last night's ligations (F+B, I.B34.CPX.B14) into BL21
#Plate transformants
#Send mer operon PCR products (merR and Pmer) to sequence

==Meeting Notes==

Polystyrene binding
working
*replacing AHL inducible promorter with constutive promoter
*ran a western, presented results
*increasing AHL, more protein (issues loading); thinking put in set amounts of known protein
**discussion about t7 and its 2 bands, uncertainty why 2 bands
**could be multimers (perhaps not a worry if it's working) could be modification of the protein
*'''double check t7 control
*'''have to put stop codon translational stops (could be read through)
*'''do finer material in bulk


Mercury Binding
received ec20 in mail with lppompa
determining hg2+, mass spec won't work
use icp-aes instead with half day training session
order hg standards samples
$30/hr to use
*might run komasi stain if expression of lpp-ompa to find concentration which is iptg inducible
seemed fine with 1ppb to 1ppm
*'''look up icp-aes works


Mercury Sensor
#3A of I13500, mer operon, iat3 - failed
#mercury binding assay - failed
#pcr -first pcr worked, second pcr with same primers failed (shouldn't work acc. to tk)
#gel - failed 600 bp in pcr product and - control, then new one no bands

*'''annealing temp?
*'''try again.  negative control should be no template



Review of overall project

Things need to be completed
-replace iptg operon by mer operon so hg inducible
-mer operon mission critical

*'''many of e coli dna remnants are in lab equipment (like primers, etc) might not even need plasmid
*'''needs crisp benchwork
*'''possible parallel efforts or drag in grads etc'''
