===Promoter Protocol===
For the followling protcol is for preparation of a culture and one set of 8 inducer concentration ranges. We wish to carry out 4 repeats of concentration and so carry out this protocol x4 in parrelel.
===Protocol===
'''Preparing the Over night Cultures'''
*Inoculate 5ml of M9 minimal media containing 50 μg/mL Ampicillin with  10μl of stored culture containing pBad test construct. 
*Incubate at 37°C for overnight in a shaker.
**<font color=green> Allows selected growth of E.coli with vector </font>
<br>
'''Day 1'''
*Incubate M9 Amp Media 37<sup>o</sup>
*Remove the overnight culture from incubator and measure Optical Density at 600nm (O.D.600) of a 4ml  sample. [[Editing IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Projects/Hrp System/Systems/Hrp Device 1/TestingValidation/Spectro| Click here]] for technique on spectrometer. 
*Calculate the volume of culture needed to give a O.D.600 in a 10ml volume, use simple calculate: 
'''volume culture = (0.1/<font color=red>O.D.600</font>)*10ml'''
*With the calculated volume of culture add pre-warmed M9 media to make total volume of 10ml
*Return the 10ml culture to the incubator and incubate at 37<sup>o</sup>C for 2 hours.
**<font color=green> The purpose of inoculating a new media is because over night E.coli will go into the stationary phase, but by inoculating a new medium we are returned cells to the exponential phase</font>
<br>
*Whilst the cultures are incubating prepare the standard dilutions of arabinose.(PROCESS)

'''2 hours Incubation'''
*Remove culture and measure O.D.600.
*Calculate the volume of culture needed to give a O.D.600 in a 15ml volume, use simple calculate: 
'''volume culture = (0.1/<font color=red>O.D.600</font>)*15ml'''
*With the calculated volume of culture add pre-warmed M9 media to make total volume of 15ml
*Spin the 15ml culture in a centrifuge for 10 mins at 300 to 2000g minutes(check). Cells will form a pellet in the bottom of the tube.
*Carefully remove the liquid in the tube (supernatant) to leave just the pellet. 
*Re-suspend the cells in 15ml of prewarmed M9 Amp and gentle vortex.
**<font color=green> This is to supply fresh media, ensures the cultures remain in the exponential phase</font>

'''Fluorometer Plate Reader'''
*Retrieve the Plate
*Remove 200μL of the culture from the 15ml into 10 wells.
*Pipette samples into a 96 well plate
*Add 2μL of pre-prepared AHL solutions to relevant well (Follow schematic)
*In addition want the following control wells:
#200μl of growth medium.
#Cultures without vector.
#A 200μL culture with 2μL of 0.2mM AHL
*Place into the fluorometer and set time intervals to relevant settings to give 50 time points.
