=='''Our Results'''==

:During the run of the summer 2006, we had time to study six 2-dimensional Dynamical Systems. Unfortunately we lacked time to carry out a thorough analysis of the 3D model.In order of complexity, the 2D models are:
<br><br>
:*<font size="4"> '''2D Model 1: Lotka – Volterra''' </font size="4">
:::[[Image:Model1.PNG]]
::*Lotka-Volterra is the first (and most famous) model for prey-predator interactions and is notoriously endowed with some very appealing properties. Lotka-Volterra also was a major inspiration for the design of the molecular predation oscillator.

<br><br>
:*<font size="4"> '''2D Model 2: Bounded Prey Growth'''</font size="4"> 
:::[[Image:Model2.PNG]]
::*Lotka-Volterra is far too simple to yield essential results on the complex 2D model. 
::*We start to investigate the influence of various components of the system by bounding the growth of the preys.

<br><br>
:*<font size="4">  '''2D Model 3: Bounded Predator and Prey Growth'''</font size="4"> 
:::[[Image:Model3.PNG]]
::*Bounding the growth of the preys only stabilises the system to the extent we cannot make it oscillate anymore. 
::*We now seek ways to obtain oscillations by bounding the growth terms of both preys and predators.

<br>
:*<font size="4">'''2D Model 3bis: Bounded  Prey Growth and Prey Killing '''</font size="4">  
:::[[Image:Model3a.PNG]]
::*We have studied this model in parallel with Model 3.
::*Instead of bounding the production of the predator, we bound the degradation of preys
::* In both cases the goal was to investigate whether the various terms of the model could balance each other and yield oscillations.

<br><br>
:*<font size="4"> '''2D Model 4: Bounded Predator and Prey Growth with Controlled Killing of Preys'''</font size="4">
:::[[Image:Model4.PNG]]
::* Bounding growth and killing yielded oscillations; bounding prey and predator growths did not.
::* We now combine both previous models and get one step closer to the final system 
::*<b>[[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2006/project/Oscillator/Theoretical Analyses/Results/2D Model4| Detailed Analysis for Model 4]]</b>
<br><br>
:* <font size="4">'''Final 2D Model : 2D Model 5'''</font size="4">
:::[[Image:Model5.PNG]]
::*Model 4 can be made to oscillate but also exhibits some very unrealistic properties.
::* Fortunately experimental conditions lead us to introduce a final dissipative term –eU to the derivative of the prey population.
::*We investigate the properties of this final 2D model and prove that the new dissipative term confers it some very interesting characteristics.
