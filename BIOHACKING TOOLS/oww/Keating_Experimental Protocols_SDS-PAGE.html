'''recipes'''

'''2x loading buffer'''

100 mM Tris-Cl pH 6.8

4% SDS

0.2% bromophenol blue

20% glycerol

200 mM DTT (add right before using)

'''5x Tris-glycine running buffer'''

25 mM Tris

250 mM glycine pH 8.3

0.1% SDS

'''Coomassie stain (1L)'''

2.5 g Coomassie dye

500 ml methanol

400 ml water

100 ml glacial acetic acid

'''destain (1L)'''

500 ml methanol

400 ml water

100 ml glacial acetic acid

'''To make 5 acrylamide gels:'''

*wash 5 glass plates and 5 white plates with ethanol
*get 10 side spacers and 5 well spacers
*stack components in multiple gel caster in order:

top caster, 5x (glass plate, 2x side spacer, white plate), glass plate, bottom caster

*clip caster in place

*make resolving gel and stacking gel solutions with following recipes

*pour the resolving gel into the gel caster
*add 200 ul of N-butanol to each gel to smooth out surface
*wait ~20 min to let solidify
*pour out butanol and rinse thoroughly with water
*add the stacking gel to each gel and insert well spacer
*let solidify
*release clips carefully to prevent bubbles in gel
*wash off excess gel
*wrap gels in wet paper towels and plastic wrap
*store at 4 C for no more than 2 weeks

'''To run gels:'''
*make aliquots of protein samples
*dilute with 2x SDS buffer
*make enough for loading 15 ul/well for 15 well spacers or 20 ul/well for 10 well spacers
*boil samples at 95 C for 5 min
*take out a gel from fridge and remove well spacer
*clean out excess gel from top of gel
*clip into gel apparatus and pour in 1x SDS running buffer in reservoirs
*load samples into wells, including 5 ul of marker
*run at 10-15 amps until samples past stacking gel, then run at 20-25 amps
*run until dye at bottom of the gel
*remove gel from apparatus and stain

'''To stain gels with Coomassie:'''
*add gel and some Coomassie stain to an empty pipette tip box
*incubate on rocker overnight or heat in microwave 30 sec, rocker 10 min, x 2-3
*rinse gel with water
*add destain and incubate 3-4hr or overnight
*remove destain and add water to let gel enlarge
*take picture in Bell lab w/ transluminating white light
