== Preparation ==

*Almost 24 hours prior to the screen, plate HeLa cells (or cells of choice) 
**in 96- or 384-well Corning flat bottom plates (Corning 3614 or 3962, respectively) 
**at a density of ~4000 cells/well in 50 µl of DMEM/10%FBS. 
*If you have to infect cells to express your protein of interest, let infection proceed for ~24 hours prior to screen.
 
== Compound Treatment ==

*On the day of the screen, add 100 nl of library compounds to a final concentration of 10-40 µM. 
*Allow cells to incubate with compound for 1 hour at room temperature. 
*For visual-based immunostaining screens, wash cells with PBS and proceed through immunostaining procedure as described [[Silver: High-throughput immunostaining|here]].
