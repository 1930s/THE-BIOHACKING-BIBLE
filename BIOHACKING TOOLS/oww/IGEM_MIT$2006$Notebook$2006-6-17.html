#check BL21 plates for transformants -- '''TONS of transformants!  They were borderline overgrown, even in the 20&mu;L plates.  I put them in the fridge; I will start liquid cultures sometime this afternoon.'''
#make D, E, F liquid cultures in LB Kan from each plate (assuming possible) -- '''Did this at 8PM; I chose 3 colonies from each of the 3 plates (20&mu;L BAMT, SAMT, and BSMT), and cultured them in 9 tubes.  I put them near the center of the rotating tube holder in the 37 degree room (for whoever comes in tomorrow...they're labeled with what they contain + VV + 6/17...it's hard to miss them :))'''
#put in 37c room with shaking for about 16 hours -- '''so...noon-ish sunday'''
#will remove next am
