=BioBrick&trade; Standard License v0.2=

The BioBricks&trade; Foundation is working to develop a framework that can be used to define the means by which BioBrick&trade; standard biological parts can be shared, distributed, modified, and used.  Our goal is to provide the designers and users of BioBrick&trade; standard biological parts with zero transaction cost ''options'' for controlling the terms by which BioBrick&trade; standard biological parts are developed and deployed.<br>
<br>
The BioBrick&trade; Standard License v0.2 (aka, BSL v0.2) is based on options.  And if you wait just a minute you'll get to see them and provide comments!
