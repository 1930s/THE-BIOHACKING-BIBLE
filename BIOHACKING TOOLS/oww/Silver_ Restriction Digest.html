==Digestion of PCR product==
# Mix:	 
#*All of PCR product DNA (~28 µL if PCR purification was eluted in 30 µL) 
#*3.5 µL 10x BSA
#*3.5 µL 10x buffer (see [http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/tech_reference/restriction_enzymes/double_digests.asp? NEB website] for optimal double digest buffer choices)  
#*0.2 µL enzyme 1 (20 units/µL)
#*0.2 µL enzyme 2 (20 units/µL)
#*distilled water to 35 µL total volume
#*Note: keep the glycerol concentration below 5%, the volume of both restriction enzymes added should not exceed 5% of the total reaction volume.
# Incubate at least an hour (better overnight) at 37 °C.
# Purify digested insert using PCR product purification kit.

==Digestion of BioBrick vector: Recommended Procedure==
# Mix: 
#*700 ng BioBrick vector (BBa_V0002 or BBa_V0100) 
#*1 µL 10 x BSA
#*1 µL 10x buffer (see [http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/tech_reference/restriction_enzymes/double_digests.asp? NEB website] for optimal double digest buffer choices) 
#*0.2 µL enzyme 1 (20 units/µL)
#*0.2 µL enzyme 2 (20 units/µL)
#*distilled water to 10 µL total volume
#*Note: To keep the glycerol concentration below 5%, the volume of both restriction enzymes added should not exceed 10% of the total reaction volume.
# Incubate overnight at 37 °C.
# The next morning, add 0.1 µL CIP (10 units/µL) and incubate for 1 hr. at 37 °C.
