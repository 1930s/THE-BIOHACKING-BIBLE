''See [[Colony PCR]] for general information about this protocol and other variants''
==Protocol==
*Use a sterile toothpick or pipet tip to resuspend a plated colony in 50 &mu;l sterile water.
*store the colony resuspension at 4C so you can start cultures if necessary (should be OK for a couple days, if   you need it to last longer you should use an [[Index plate]].

===Reaction Mix===
Use the following reaction mix for each PCR reaction:
*1 &mu;l 10x Thermo polymerase buffer
*1 &mu;l 10x dNTPs (10x = 2.5 mM each dNTP)
*0.15 &mu;l 40 &mu;M FWD primer
*0.15 &mu;l 40 &mu;M REV primer
*0.1 &mu;l Polymerase (taq or vent)
*6.6 &mu;l H<sub>2</sub>O
*1.0 &mu;l template suspension

===PCR protocol===
*95 C for 6 minutes (disrupt cells, separate DNA)
*Cycle 35 times:
**95 C for 30 s (melting)
**53 C (or whatever temperature is appropriate) for 30 s (annealing) 
**72 C for X s (elongation)
*72 C for 10 minutes (final elongation)
*4 C forever
*For long amplicons, X = 1 minute + 2.5 s per 100bp
*For shorter amplicons, under ~1kb, this can be shortened judiciously.
