==Function==
*To provide a landing site for ligand.
*To cause dimerization/conformational change in the Receiver.
*To transmit signal to Receiver.
*Will use anti-fluorescein scFv for test phase.
*Ultimately use anti-rabbit scFv for system.

==Experiments==
*To test whether the scFvs are expressed? How?
*We need constitutive promoter with RBS upstream of it. There is one in the library available. Biobrick scFv onto RBS/promoter, and it should express. Do a western blot to see if protein expression by using FLAG tag. We need anti-FLAG antibody (ask Natalie).
