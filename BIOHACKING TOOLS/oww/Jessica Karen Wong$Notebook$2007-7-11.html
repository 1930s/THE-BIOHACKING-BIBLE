==I2057==
*1AK3
**Overnight plate had tons of very small colonies - jason said it's probably not right
**Colony PCR'ed 4 samples
**Ran on gel - didn't show (the middle 4 lanes on top)
**Spun down rest of transformation and replated
*3K3
**Overnight plate had many colonies that looked good
**PCRed 4 samples
**Ran on gel - looks the right size (1st 4 lanes on top after ladder)
**Made overnights to prep for sequencing

==I2056==
*Saw no growth on both I2056-1AT3 and I2056-1AC3 plates
*Spun down rest of transformation and plated
*Got sequencing back - still not built

==I2055==
*Got sequencing in for the religation 
**Only matches at 110 - aka still doesn't contain the promoter
*Redid the colony PCRs (scarred product w/ pcr'ed in promoter in 1AK3)
**Used vent and a 1:30 ext time
**Comparing with a positive control of P1010 in 3K3

==E0240==
*Overnight plate of E0240-3K3 had a large number of colonies
**Colony PCRed 4 samples
**Ran on gel - all look to small
**Made overnights to prep for sequencing
**Got old E0240-3K3 sequencing back
** was messed up but only part there matched some of E0040 (GFP)
*Ran overnight BB PCR of E0240-1AK3 on a gel
**Of samples that showed up (we ran out of DNA) they were very smeary
**The only bright band on the gel is from our pos control P1010
**RePCR'ed overnight with Phusion at 53.5 w/ 1 min ext time
*Got sequencing of E0240-1AK3 back
**Sequencing was a bit messed up, but the Nsi/Pst site was scarred
**Sending for sequencing again just to make sure  but Most Likely Scarred!

==T9002==
*Good haul on both overnight plates T9002-1AK3 and T9002-3K3
**Col PCR 4 samples of each
**Ran gel (bottom row) - all products were too small
**Made overnights to sequence
*Got sequencing back for T9002-3K3
**Sequence only matched some of the 3K3 plasmid
