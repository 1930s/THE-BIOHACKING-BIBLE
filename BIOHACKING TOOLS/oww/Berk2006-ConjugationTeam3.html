Conjugated EC100d with
#J01064 db1K0 #1
#J01064 db1K0 #2
#J01064 db1K0 #3
#J01064 db1K0 #4
#J23015-J01064
on Tri Amp

Also I made TriK and TriA plates

==JL_10/09/06==
#Mate J23016 with Ec100D (see if the trbC knockout transfers its
plasmid, so plate on TriK)
#Do genomic minipreps of J23087 (4 clones)
#Mini and map J23086 (4 clones)
#Mini and map J23088 (2 clones)

==JL_09/29/06==
#Preperative digest of pJ23006-J23006 (AlwnI/Spei, 2068 Long)
#Preperative digest of psB1A2-J01003 (AlwnI/Xbai, 925 short)
#4 Analytical digests(AvrII/SpeI) each of J23074 (want band at 23097) and J23075 (want band at 824)
#grow up J23016

==JL_09/22/06==
Today's to do list:
#stock and mini pSB1AG0-J23078, map EcoRI/SpeI 
# grow up J23055 #1 for electro comp
#grow up J23016 (trbC::Cm)  for the knockout (later gen. mini and PCR with JL16/17)
#Rlam/J23057 x pSB1A2-J01003 redo

==JL_09/20/06==
Today I...
- mini-preped  J23074 and J23075, and pSB1AKG0-b0015
- gen. mini and PCR J23055
- grew up Rlam/J23057
- analytical digest of J23074 and J23075

Four clones were spotted the other day, all 4 were ampS and camS.  The JL3/4 PCRs were done on genomic preps today. Jen setup and sam ran PCRs of J23055 clones 1 and 2.  Clone 1 looks correct, it was stocked and replated to make comp cells.<br>

==JL_09/18/06==
Today I have to:
#Grow up J23074 and J23075 (4 clones each)
#Grow and spot J23055 (43 degrees J23015 x pCP20)
#Run PCR of J23069 with your traG 20mers
