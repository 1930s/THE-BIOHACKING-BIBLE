==Linking the genes: inferring gene network models from gene expression data==

by

Alberto de la Fuente

Genome wide gene expression profiling enables discovery of regulatory
relationships between genes. Depending on the experimental design behind
the expression data, undirected (correlational) or directed (causal)
network models can be extracted. In this tutorial I will introduce the
concept of gene networks and review many important methods that have
been applied to characterize such network models from gene expression data.

Proposed content:
- What are gene networks?
- Inferring gene networks: Pair-wise vs. global model search
- Undirected gene network models - measures of association, graphical
Gaussian modeling
- (Partially) directed gene network models - Bayesian networks,
Structural Equation Modeling
