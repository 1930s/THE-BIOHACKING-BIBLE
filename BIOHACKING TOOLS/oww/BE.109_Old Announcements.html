==Module 2 Announcements==
*'''Oral Presentations''': Talks will be from 1-5, with a snack break midway through the afternoon. The Tuesday/Thursday section will present in <font color="red">56-602 on Thursday March 23rd </font> and the Wednesday/Friday section will present in <font color="red">56-614 on Friday March 24th</font>.

*<b>03/08/2006</b>: A map for finding building E17 (or E18) where we will perform a flow cytometry analysis is available at the [[Talk:BE.109:DNA engineering/FACS analysis#Directions to flow facility | discussion page for Module 1 Day 8: FACS analysis experiment]].
*<b>03/04/2006</b>: Congratulations on getting the delta5 clones! Gel images are now posted on the [[Talk:BE.109:DNA engineering/Restriction map and tissue culture | discussion page for the Module 1 Day 6: Restriction map and tissue culture experiment]].
*<b>03/01/2006</b>: Class data from ligations/transformations is posted on the [[Talk:BE.109:DNA engineering/Examine candidate clones | discussion page for Module 1 Day 5: examining candidate clones]]. Some discussion about the efficiency calculation is there as well.  
*<b>02/27/2006</b>: You can download the introduction slides for manuscript discussion from [[Talk:BE.109:DNA engineering/Restriction map and tissue culture | discussion page for Module 1 Day 6: Restriction map and tissue culture experiment]]. If you have any trouble, please email to Yoon Sung (yoonsung@mit.edu) ahead of time.  
*<b>02/27/2006</b>: Check out the [[Talk:BE.109:DNA engineering/DNA ligation and bacterial transformation | discussion page at Module 1 Day 4: DNA ligation and bacterial transformation]] if you are having trouble deciding on enzymes to use for your diagnostic digests. 
*<b>02/24/2006</b>: nice results from yesterday's ligation and transformation experiment! Everyone has some candidates to screen next time....
*<b>02/23/2006</b>: a few hints to help you plan your ligations have now been posted at [[Talk:BE.109:DNA engineering/DNA ligation and bacterial transformation | discussion page at Module 1 Day 4: DNA ligation and bacterial transformation]].
*<b>02/22/2006</b>: If you're not sure how to take the log10 of the length of the DNA ladder, clarification is posted at [[Talk:BE.109:DNA engineering/Agarose gel electrophoresis | discussion page at Module 1 Day 3: Agarose gel electrophoresis]].
*<b>02/19/2006</b>: Images of your gels with recovery results have been uploaded to the [[Talk:BE.109:DNA engineering/Agarose gel electrophoresis | discussion page at Module 1 Day 3: Agarose gel electrophoresis]].'''
*<b>02/16/2006</b>:The images of your gels from lab have been uploaded to the [[Talk:BE.109:DNA engineering/Agarose gel electrophoresis | discussion page at Module 1 Day 3: Agarose gel electrophoresis]].  More gel images to assess the recovery of your fragments will follow. Congratulations on such nice work! --[[User:Nkuldell | Natalie]]
