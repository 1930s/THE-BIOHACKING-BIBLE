==Preparation of Stock Solutions==
*1x 1 litre of 2xYT medium in Duran bottle
*3x 1 litre of 2xYT medium in conical flask
**Sent to autoclave
*1x 10 ml of pre-incubation solution for preparation of cell extract
*6x 20 ml of 1mM IPTG stock

==Preparation of Cell Extract==
#Picked a BL21(DE3) colony from Tet plate
#Innoculated in 100 ml of 2xYT + Tet medium
#Incubated overnight at 37 °C

==Cloning of Biobricks==
#Placed 5 ml of LB in a 15 ml tube
#Added appropriate antibiotics into the tube
#Picked a colony from the fresh overnight plate
#Innoculated the colony in the LB media
#Incubated for 6 hours during the day
#*2x 6 Biobricks cloned

==Cloning of Biobricks (for Midiprep)==
#Placed 50 ml of LB in a 250 ml conical flask
#Innoculated 1 ml of culture into LB media in flask
#Incubated overnight at 37 °C

==Pilot Preparation of Vesicles==

*The suspension prepared the [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Notebook/2007-8-13#Pilot Preparation of Vesicles | day before]] was used to produce vesicles enclosing Tris and NaCl buffer only.

*There was a mistake in following the protocol: instead of preparing the interface with 2ml of the DOPC-mineral oil suspension and then adding 100&mu;l of emulsion to it, the emulsion was prepared according to protocol, and then 2ml of emulsion was used to create the interface.

*'''Results''': A sample was briefly looked at under a light microscope, but no vesicles were observed.
