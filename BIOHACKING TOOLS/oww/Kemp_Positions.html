'''Postdocs'''
<br>
Qualified candidates should contact Melissa Kemp about potential employment opportunities. 
<br> <br>
'''Graduate Students'''
<br> 
Graduate students who have been admitted to either the BME or Bioengineering graduate programs may contact Melissa Kemp about opportunites to rotate with or join the lab. Depending on background and experience, graduate students in other disciplines (i.e. ChBE , Biology, Bioinformatics) may also be eligible to join the group. ''Dr. Kemp does not serve on any graduate admissions committees and cannot tell you based on your GRE or TOEFL scores whether you will be admitted.'' <br> <br>

'''Undergraduate Research Assistants'''
<br>
Undergraduates interested in conducting research with the lab need to submit the following materials electronically to Dr. Kemp for consideration.

1) A resume, including work history and references <br>
2) A copy of their academic transcripts (unofficial okay) <br>
3) A brief statement about why they're interested in working in the lab <br>

Only the best students who are highly motivated and responsible will be considered. Undergraduate researchers are expected to commit to a minimum of 2 semesters and 10-15 hours/week if they seriously want to conduct research in the lab. We would love to provide undergraduate research opportunities for the many outstanding students, but unfortunately have limited positions available at any time.
