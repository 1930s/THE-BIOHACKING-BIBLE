==Introduction==

Bacterial biofilms provide systems of the complexity needed to
exemplify many of the generic features of multi-cellular behaviour,
without such complexity at once becoming overwhelming. They are in
addition of enormous environmental, industrial and medical
importance. Many processes in biofilms operate at the macroscopic scale and are
thus susceptible continuum modelling approaches. It is essential,
however, that models incorporate in an appropriate way information
about the micro-scale behaviour and their results must in turn be
coupled back into the rules adopted in the cell-scale modelling,
motivating the use of agent-based modelling. The simulation of
such complex systems typically requires huge
computing resources. The Grid provides an unrivalled technology
for large scale distributed simulation and is exceptionally well
suited to addressing the challenges raised by integrative-biology. In
this paper we present BacGrid, a system for performing distributed
simulation of bacteria using the High Level Architecture (HLA) and the
Grid. We present the bacterial model and show results from initial
experiments investigating the role of quorum sensing molecule (QSM) in
the development of the bacterial colony. We go on to sketch out the
design for the distribution of bacterial simulation components across
the grid and indicate how this technology can be used to create large
scale simulations. We conclude with a discussion of the current status
of the system and our plans for future work and experiments.

==Bacterial Model==

BacGrid models a 3D biofilm reactor, with bacteria growing inside a
rectangular box with periodic x and y boundaries. Bacteria, substrate
and other material is assumed to be washed away once they reach the z
boundary (detachment layer). BacGrid is a simulation in which agents are particles that
represent collections of bacteria cells. The size of these particles
can be varied, from a minimum size where each particle represents a
single cell, to a size where a single particle may represent hundreds
or even thousands of cells. Particle based simulation <cite>Kreft04</cite> has
the same advantages as individual based models (IBM) while reducing
the computational requirements for such simulations. We model
substrate uptake, growth and maintenance of each individual particle
using equations from <cite>Kreft98</cite>. Particles are contained within
voxels, which are 3D volumes of constant pressure, substrate and QSM
concentration. Substrate and QSM diffuse between voxels and particles
a transferred between voxels when there is a sufficient pressure
difference.

Our initial experiments are investigating the role of QSM in the
development of bacterial colonies, in particular we are looking at how
QSM inhibitors can be used to prevent the up-regulation of cells. <cite>King02</cite>. To fully investigate the
effect of QSM molecules on colony development it is necessary to
simulate large bacterial colonies with tens of millions of
bacteria. Executing such large scale simulations is sometimes
impossible on single machines and therefore it is necessary
to investigate applying techniques from parallel and distributed
simulation field to bacterial simulations.

==Distribution==

Parallel and Distributed simulation is a well established field of
research<cite>Fujimoto00</cite> which has been applied in a wide variety of
areas. The High Level Architecture (HLA)<cite>HLA</cite>, is a simulation standard developed by the US department of defense, Defense Modelling and Simulation Office (DMSO) (now IEEE standard 1516) which describes a set of services which define a common language which different simulators can
inter-operate. In the context of distributed simulation and distrbuted computing in general the GRID offers potentially unbounded computational resources, 
the development of HLA_GRID <cite>HLA_GRID</cite>
allows HLA simulations to inter-operate across the GRID, the result is
the ability to run large scale simulations across the grid.

The BacGrid simulation has been developed using the MASON <cite>Mason</cite>
agent toolkit and is designed to be HLA compliant, which
means the simulation (Federation in HLA terms) can be split into
multiple simulation components (Federates). Using HLA_GRID it is then
possible to execute different parts of the BacGrid simulation on
remote machines connected across the grid. A BacGrid model is
decomposed into two component types, a Diffusion federate and a model
region federate. To do this the BacGrid model is decomposed into model
regions which are collections of voxels, the model regions then
execute on remote machines and communicate with each other and the
diffusion federate through HLA_GRID.




==Future work==

Current work involves completing the distribution of the model and upgrading the implementation of HLA_GRID.
The hope is to try an improve on the overheads found in <cite>HLA_GRID</cite>, this will
hopefully make it feasible to execute experiments across the GRID
between Nottingham, Singapore and Birmingham. One of the goals of GRID enabled simulation is the ability to compose
models automatically allowing experimenters to use or combine their
models with existing models, possibly creating multi-scale (both in
time and space) models. This is an area of work we would like to
investigate in the future, integrating BacGrid with
individual cell models creating bacterial simulations that execute
from the sub-cellular level all the way up to the level of the colony.
