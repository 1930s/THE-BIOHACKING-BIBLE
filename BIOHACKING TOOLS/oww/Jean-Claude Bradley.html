I teach organic chemistry at [http://www.drexel.edu Drexel University].  Two of my courses [http://chem241.wikispaces.com CHEM 241] and [http://chem243.blogspot.com CHEM243] are made available mainly as open courseware with full screencast and podcast recorded lectures.<br><br>

I think that there is a tremendous opportunity to leverage the open sharing of knowledge in reasearch as well as teaching.  To this end, I initiated the [[UsefulChem]] project.  We can handle much of the synthesis tasks in my lab.  Collaborators are sought for other tasks, such as the in vitro testing of our inhibitors. <br><br>
