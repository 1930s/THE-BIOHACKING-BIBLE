===Oscilloscope Lab===

----
'''Setup'''

Plugging in and turning on the oscilloscope and signal generator were the initial steps.  After that was connecting the BNC cables to the correct positions.  I initally plugged the channel 1 BNC cable into the <b>SWEEP</b> output on the function generator, which did not work at all.  The correct plug was the 50 ohms port which Devon located for me.  Fiddling commenced and a reasonable amount of fiddling resulted in a very fine looking sine wave.

'''Measuring Characteristics'''
{{Side comment|comment=[[User:Steven J. Koch|Steven J. Koch]] 01:20, 5 September 2007 (EDT): This is most likely a problem with the scope thinking you were using a "10x" probe...I should have mentioned this before the lab started, but I think we discussed this later in the afternoon...}}
1. '''Grid Lines'''  

Adjusting the <b>Volts/Div</b> knob essentially zoomed in on the sine waves, but actually made it more difficult to get a reasonable guess (because of necessary position adjustments, etc.).  I stuck with 20 V as my Volts/Div.  Approximating by sight and the grid lines I figured the amplitude be <u>~85 volts</u>.  I placed the approximate frequency at <u>200 Hz</u>, based on the frequency that is displayed on screen.

2. '''Cursors'''  

Hitting the <b>CURSOR</b> brought up some bars on the O-scope that could be moved vertically and horizontally by adjusting their respective knobs.  Using the same 'resolution' as I was before, I measured the frequency to be <u>200 Hz</u>(with a period of 5 ms) and the amplitude to be <u>87.2 V</u>.

3. '''Measure'''  

Using the <b>MEASURE</b> button and setting the type to <b>Freq</b>, the o-scope gave me exact value for the frequency: <u>200 Hz</u>.  I set the type to <b>Period</b> and it produced the value <u>5.004 ms</u>, which is 4/1000<sup>ths</sup> off from the approximation that was produced from the cursors.  Very high precision indeed.

We must keep in mind the O-scope is giving us a digital display, and there are inherit limitations to displaying information using a finite resolution.  When I crank up the frequency to anything higher than 20KHz and the <b>Volts/Div</b> is set above one volt the image is nonexistent.  On the other hand, if I set the frequency to below 10 Hz, the O-scope doesn't really register anything.

'''Triggering'''
{{Side comment|comment=[[User:Steven J. Koch|Steven J. Koch]] 01:22, 5 September 2007 (EDT): yes, I believe you loved re-reading that article.  It is great the way you referred to Zane's notebook and gave him credit--good science practice!}}
1. Re-read article; loved it.
2. '''Rising Edge'''  From the article, I am led to believe the the rising edge triggering is when the sweep stops after the input signal begins rising past a predetermined voltage.  Referring to Zane's Notebook led me to play with the triggering functions and I was really able to see what rising edge meant.  As he states, falling edge just appears to display the opposite.

'''AC Coupling'''

I set the O-scope to a low frequency (~6Hz) and zooming into 5V @ 25ms did several trials at different amplitudes to get a decent spread of data.

*Amplitude(A) @ 10 V
*:10% of 10V=1 V
*:time to reach=51 ms

* A=11.5 V
*:<math>\Delta\,</math>V = 8V
*:10%=.8 V
*:time=34.8 ms

* A=4 V
*:<math>\Delta\,</math>V= 10.6 V
*:10%=1.06
*:time=53 ms

* A=2 V
*:<math>\Delta\,</math>V = 11V
*:10% = 1.1
*:time=68 ms

<b>RC Constants</b>
I read Bradley's notebook and found this: (<math>RC=\tau=\frac {t_r}{2.197} </math>):
Using that to find the RC constants I get:
*23.21
*15.84
*24.12
*30.95

These average out to about 24 s.
