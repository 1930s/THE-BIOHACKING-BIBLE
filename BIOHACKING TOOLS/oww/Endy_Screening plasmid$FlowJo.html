*For the beads .fcs file, gate on the beads population (should be bigger than cells in FCS vs. SSC plot) and calibrate FL1 (GFP) and FL7 (RFP) with the values found [[Endy:FACS_calibration_with_beads#FlowJo_Calibration|here]] on FlowJo.
**When calibrating the peaks, there's an option for "Use original dynamic range" - not sure what this is for, leaving it unchecked for now
*Use the negative control (CW2553/pJat8 only) to gate a positive region.
