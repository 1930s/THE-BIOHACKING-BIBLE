==Osmosis==
* pressure given by van't Hoff law ([[../2006-09-18/|prev lecture]])
* <math>\pi(x,t)= RTC_\Sigma(x,t)</math>
* semipermeable membrane reflects solutes <math>\Delta\pi \rightarrow \Delta p</math>
* osmotic pressure exactly the same as hydraulic pressure except opposite in sign
* only have to consider <math>p-\pi</math>
* <math>\Phi_V = L_V((p^i-\pi^i)-(p^o-\pi^o))</math>
* Note that the volume flux of <math>\Phi</math> is different from the normal flux <math>\phi</math> in its units. <math>\Phi</math> has units of m/s whereas <math>\phi</math> has units of mol/(m^2 s). As we are considering a volume of incompressible fluid (water), we can convert one to the other using a conversion factor (e.g. 55 mol/L for water).

== Osmosis in cells ==
* only water crosses membrane
* <math>p^i=p^o</math>
* <math>\frac{dV^i}{dt} = -A(t)\Phi_V = -A(t)RTL_V(C^o_\Sigma(t)-C^i_\Sigma(t))</math>
* equilibrium: <math>\frac{dV^i}{dt} = 0 \rightarrow (C^o_\Sigma(\infty)=C^i_\Sigma(\infty))</math>
** solution is <math>v_c(\infty) = v_c' + \frac{N^i_\Sigma}{C^o_\Sigma}</math> (perfect osmometer)
** ''non-linear'' relationship between <math>C^o_\Sigma</math> and volume of cell
* Experimental data for many types of cells agrees with this equation
