==Debrief==

===Vesicles===
Should the testing and characterisation of vesicles be pursued?
====Reasons to abandon====
*Process of formation not very predictable - not even with same protocols
**variation would affect characterisation
*May not be able to carry out all tests for the applications
**not enough time or resources (finances and equipment)
*No method of counting vessicles - but can get less accurate results by population analysis
*Found non-toxic pore protein - expensive
*ID lagging in terms of testing of constructs - can use the man power in the lab
*Would need a lot more man power to carry on research and do experiments - may still not finish on time!
====Reasons to pursue====
*GFP may degrade after a few hours in-vitro - vessicles would increase life-span to ~ 3-4 days
**life-span of at least a few days required for the CBD construct to fulfil current specification
**but can modify the specification - threshold device rather than thermal history?
*Haven't yet tried the cell extract in vessicles - may get better results!

===Experiments===
*Phase 2 started - testing CBD constructs for temperature 
*Experiments going ok - but may run over in terms of the budget
*ID construct - purification of LuxR may take time

===Wiki===
*Tidy up 'public wiki' - seperate from 'working wiki'
*Protocols hard to understand for outsiders - make more readable
*Calender??
*Anthony and Alex to re-design the wiki
