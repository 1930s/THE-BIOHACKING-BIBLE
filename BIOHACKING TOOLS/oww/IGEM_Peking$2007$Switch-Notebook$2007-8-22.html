==organize double promoter==
we have already got 9 promoters with prove of sequencing:
2 Rec, 1 lac, 3 SS1, 2 SS2, 2 SS3, 4 SD2, 1 SD3, 2 RD1 and 1 RS3
we still need 8 kinds of promoters:
sulA, SD1, RD2, RD3, RS1, RS2, CD1 and CD2

==re-PCR CD1, CD2 and SulA==

==plasmid mini-prep of lacI-pcc009==

==re-ligation of lacI-PMD18-T and transformation== 

==ligation of SS1, RS1, RS2, RD2, lacI with pcc009==

==colony PCR to test lacI-pcc009==
primers are pkan-lam-F and pcc-test-R
