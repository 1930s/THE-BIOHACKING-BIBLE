== Background on the Lead Sensor ==
Public health concern: Lead in soil, paint, water, dust
Lead Poisoning is often caused by ingesting contaminated drinking water, or soil. It can cause neurological and gastrointestinal disorders, especially among children.

The legal limit of lead in drinking water is 15 parts per billion.

Current ways of testing for lead either require expensive chemical lab analysis or involve inaccurate home kits. 

So why do we want a biosensor?
	- Cheap
	- Sensitive
	- Quick
	- Specific

Our system involves a Lead detecting promoter, an amplifier, and an output of GFP. We're also working on a system to remove false positives.
