==Overview==
This is a protocol to anneal and ligate oligo's to construct short DNA fragments for cloning (~100 bp)

==Materials==
*3 oligo pairs with 4-5 base pair overlaps
**''Austin suggests 6 bp overlaps.''
*T4 DNA ligase
*T4 DNA ligase buffer
*T4 polynucleotide kinase

==Procedure==
#[[Knight:Reconstituting primers|Resuspend primers]].
#Kinase treat each oligo using the following reaction mix for each primer.
#*2 &mu;L primer (5 &mu;M final concentration)
#*1 &mu;L 10X T4 DNA ligase buffer
#*6.5 &mu;L H<sub>2</sub>O
#*0.5 &mu;L T4 polynucleotide kinase
#Incubate at 37 &deg;C for 1 hr 30 mins
#Heat kill at 65 &deg;C for 20 mins
#Mix all 10&mu;L of kinase treated oligo with its pair to make duplex oligos.
#Heat to 70-75 &deg;C and cool to anneal oligo pairs.
#Mix all 20 &mu;L of each duplex together in one tube.
#Make up ligation reaction
#*1 &mu;L of the oligo mix
#*50 ng [[Knight:Restriction Digest|digested]] vector backbone
#**The assembled oligo construct should have complementary ends to the prepared vector
#*1 &mu;L 10X T4 DNA ligase buffer
#*H<sub>2</sub>O to 10 uL
#Add 0.5 &mu;L T4 DNA ligase
#Incubate for 1hr 30 mins at 16&deg;C.
#Transform.

==Notes==
*I did not include 5' phosphates on the flanking primers to decrease the likelihood of forming multimers.
*Pete Carr recommends PCR construction and assembly since ligation methods can be unreliable.
*Too much ligase may adversely affect the reaction.
