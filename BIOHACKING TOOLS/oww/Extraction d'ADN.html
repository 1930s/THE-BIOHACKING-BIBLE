Get a fresh culture of E. huxleyi (e.g 500 ml)
Centrifuge 10 min at 20000 g
Add 50 to 100 µl og GITC Buffer*
Mix it gently using fingertip knock
Keep it frozen (-20°C) if you want to stock the sample or proceed the following instructions
Add a volume of phenol pH 8
Incubate for 5 min at RT
Save the aqueous phase in a clean tube
Add 1 volume of phenol-chloroform-alcool isoamylic (25:24:1), invert the tube three times
Incubate 5 min at RT
Centrifuge 10 min at 8000g
Save the aequous phase in a clean tube
Add 1 volume of chloroform
Incubate 5 min at RT
Centrifuge 10 min at 8000 g
Save the aqueous phase in a clean tube
Add 1/10 volume sodium acetate 3M pH 5.2 and 2 volume of 100% ethanol
Keep the tube from 30 min to 1 hour at -80°C or ON at -20 °C
Centrifuge 20 min at 9000 g
Remove the supernatant
Wash the pellet in 500 µl  70 % ethanol
Centrifuge 10 min at 7500 g
Remove the supernatant
Resuspend the pellet in 50-100 µl sterile water
Keep it on ice for 1 hour at 4 °C

GITC buffer:
100 g guanidine thiocyanate in 100 ml distilled water
10.6 ml 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.6)
Stir ON at RT (it takes usually several hours, don't forget to put a cover when stirring the solution)
Add 21.2 ml 5% sarkosyl and 2.1 ml beta-mercaptoethanol
Adjust the volume to 212 ml in distilled water
Store at 4°C in a brown bottle or wrap in aluminium foil
