because electrons are bound, total energy is zero...
therefore, kinetic energy of electrons = potential energy of electrons.
kinetic energy is 1/2mv^2
change in potential energy of the electron =  charge of electron x change in electrical potential of the anode

1/2mv^2=eV

electron travels in a circle, because there's a magnetic field toward us, and the velocity is tangent to the circle, and magnetic force on the electron is -evxB.  toward center.

and centripetal force is always the same: mv^2/r

so equate those:
evB=mv^2/r
e=mv/rB
e/m=v/rB
