===Promoter Test Construct===
The promoter pLux is to be tested at 8 varying ranges of inducer concentration.
*pLux will have a range of 0 to 100μM  AHL added at intervals of 12.5μM [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Projects/Hrp System/Systems/Hrp Device 1/TestingValidation/Protocolplux| Protocol]]

===Device Test Construct===
For this test construct we initially need to run a preliminary test in order to find out the time intervals and input ranges we need. We will start the preliminary test using the range of concentrations used initially for promoters.
