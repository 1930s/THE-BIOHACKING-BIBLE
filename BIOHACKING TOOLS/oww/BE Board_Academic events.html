==Bioengineering in Society Discussions==
The BE Board is trying out an event series focused on the impacts of biotechnology on society.  Discussions are led by outside experts on subjects such as intellectual property, national security, or public perceptions.  Contact the academic representatives (be-academic[at]mit.edu) with any ideas for topics or speakers.
