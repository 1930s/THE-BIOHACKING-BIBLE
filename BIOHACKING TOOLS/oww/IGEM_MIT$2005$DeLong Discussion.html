*Rhod. in E.Coli, grabbing free proton from interior of cell, through shuttle mech. in retinal, producing proton. 
*Source of protons can come from anything (fermentation, example). 
*Rates: Can do calculations by looking at graphs. dpH in 5 minutes -.05 of 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. appx. -.01 pH drop/min.
*Maybe engineer the host that you put it in.
**Membrane vesicles possibly
**We should do this: look at ATP pool in the cell (flux) to see if the proton pumping with light actually affects the nucleotide...(something)?
**Can we get sustainable proton flux over reasonable amt time? Reasonable production?
***Just a flash? No worries. 
**The proof of principle is more important than how sustainable the cell is. That can come later.
*E.coli gets reducing power (NADH) from foodstuffs, fermentation from LB, perspiring aerobically, biochemical mechanisms that produce protons itself. 
*Need retinal in the media in order to express something and make it work.
*Real concern whether you can take those protons and do something with it.
