This species was described by Greene, but has not been subsequently recognised. It appears to be restricted to a small area of Calaveras County, California. It is obligately annual and appears to be self-fertilising. We found it growing on the basalt and conglomerate at the top of Table Mountain, Calaveras Co, in a situation M. guttatus would be unable to grow.
