'''This is a wishlist of vectors that we would like to have but are not currently available.'''

==pSB2*==

===pSB2AT3-P1010===
purpose: inducible copy number plasmid to be used in the three antibiotic selection
assembly technique.
===pSB2AK3-P1010===
purpose: inducible copy number plasmid to be used in the three antibiotic selection
assembly technique.
===pSB2AC3-P1010===
purpose: inducible copy number plasmid to be used in the three antibiotic selection
assembly technique.

==pSB4*==
Randy would like to have the full complement of low copy vectors for assembly purposes.

Here is what they might look like using a pSC101 origin:

Randy would like to have the full complement of low copy vectors for assembly purposes.

Here is what they might look like using a pBR322 origin:
