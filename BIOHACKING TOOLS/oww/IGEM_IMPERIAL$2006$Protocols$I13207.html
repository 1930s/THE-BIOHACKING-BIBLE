==I13207 AiiA Test Construct Protocol==

*Culture bacteria (DH5a) in LB medium, incubate overnight
*Transfer plasmids with desired part via electroporation
*Incubate overnight
*Transfer colonies into liquid medium (amp resistant, 2ml)
*Wait until optical density is 0.1

*Make 20mL of 1% arabinose LB solution 
*Then make the following solutions:

*Transfer arabinose solutions into 5 different labeled tubes
*One well is filled with pure LB media in all experiments as a control
*Transfer 2 mL of each arabinose solution into separate clear tubes
*Add 200ul of DH5a culture into the tubes
*Assay with an automatically repeating protocol of absorbance measurements (600nm filter, 0.1 second absorbance through approximately 0.5cm of fluid)
*Fluorescence readings (488nm excitation filter, 525nm emission filter, 0.5 second, CW lamp energy 12902 units) 
*Shake (1 mm, linear, normal speed)
*Time between measurements should be 20 minutes
*Time period for measurements should be ~5 h

*'''Perform 2 tests: one with 0.5ml of 0.5M ZnCl2 in the LB medium and one without'''
