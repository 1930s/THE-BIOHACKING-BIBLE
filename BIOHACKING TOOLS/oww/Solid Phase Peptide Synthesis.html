This protocol uses Fmoc chemistry ([[#note 1]]).  The reaction mixture and calculation is based on 0.1mmol of resin, with a target peptide yield of 50-100mg.

==Reagents==

===Stock Solutions===
*0.6M HoBt in DMF (0.81g/10ml)
*0.6M PyBOP in DMF (3.12g/10mL) ([[#note 2]])
*30/70(v/v) Piperidine/DMF solution  ([[#note 3]]), ([[#note 4]])

===Ninhydrin Reagents===
*15g phenol in 4.5mL ethanol
*0.0002M KCN in pyridine  ([[#note 5]])
*500mg ninhydrin in 10mL ethanol

===Other Reagents===
*Dichloromethane (DCM)
*Dimethylformamide (DMF)
*4-Methylmorpholine (NMM)

==Procedure==

===Preparing resin===
Weigh out the desired amount of resin and place in a peptide synthesis vessel with a glass frit.  Swell the resin in DCM or DMF for at least an hour, preferrably two.  The resin can be swelled overnight for use the following morning.

===Deprotection===

Initial deprotection is only necessary if the resin is attached to a protecting group; however, this is quite likely to be the case.

#  Swell the resin with 30% piperidine (~ 3ml) for 2 min, stirring occasionally
#  Swell the resin with 30% piperidine (~ 3ml) for 20 min, stirring occasionally
#  Wash with at least 30 ml DMF using slow flow to remove piperidine

===Coupling===

#  Weigh out 3 resin equivalents (0.3 mmol) of amino acid.
#Add 500&mu;L HoBt and  500&mu;L PyBOP to amino acid, vortex to dissolve.
#  Add 5.4 eq (60&mu;L) NMM.  Can use up to 6 equivalents.
#  Mix by inversion and allow to react for 30-40 seconds.  The solution should turn slightly yellow.
#*no reaction time needed for Asp, Glu, Cys, or His
#  Add amino acid mixture to resin.  Allow to react for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
#  Try the ninhydrin test.  If unsuccessful, repeat the test in 30 minute intervals until coupling is complete.  If test shows no change after 2 hours, repeat coupling procedure using the same amino acid.

===Ninhydrin Test===

#  Aliquot 20&mu;L of resin from the reaction tube into a filter tube.  ([[#note 6]])
#  Wash the resin aliquot with DMF and DCM, fast flow.  Be sure to rinse well.
#  Dry the aliquot until it is a powder, then transfer it into a glass culture tube.
#  Add 40&mu;L phenol/ethanol + 40&mu;L KCN/pyridine + 20&mu;L Ninhydrin/EtOH to the resin aliquot.
#  Heat the tube at 95 Â°C for 2-5 minutes.  A bluish color indicates an unfinished reaction.  A completed reaction looks pink.

===Capping===

#  Wash the resin with 30mL of DMF (slow flow)
#  Repeat deprotection procedure to remove the N-terminal Fmoc group
#  Add 5ml of 10% acetic anhydride/10% NMM in DMF. React for 30 min.
#  Use the ninhydrin test to check for completion.
#  Wash resin with 30 mL DMF, slow flow.
#  Wash resin with DMF, DCM, and hexane in fast flow.
#  Dry the resin, store in a vial at 4&deg;C until ready to cleave from resin.

==Notes==
<div id="note 1">1.  In Fmoc chemistry, the peptide is synthesized from C-terminus to N-terminus.  Keep this in mind when determining the amino acid order of addition.
</div>
<div id="note 2">2.  The coupling reagents HoBt and PyBOP lose effectiveness if stored for extended periods of time.  For best results, remake for each new synthesis.
</div>
<div id="note 3">3.  Piperidine is a restricted substance due to its potential use in the synthesis of a controlled substance.  If your lab has never ordered it before, request it far in advance; there may be significant paperwork to submit before order processing.
</div>
<div id="note 4">4.  Many of the reagents and solvents can dissolve/corrode plastics.  Either pipet quickly, or use glass or organic-compatible pipetmen to prevent equipment damage.  Similarly, be careful of storing solutions in plastic containers.
</div>
<div id="note 5">5.  KCN is insoluble in pure pyridine.  To make the solution, dissolve an excess amount of KCN in water, then dilute the solution to the desired concentration using pyridine.
