== Additional ==
* for more on the ideas of ''independence'' and ''reachability'', look into control theory.  Richard Murray at Caltech is working on a text, which is online: [http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/books/AM05/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page Feedback Systems - An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers].  Also, the idea of ''observability'' is interesting to think about, in terms of what cellular processes we can study and understand.

* Also, the slides are best viewed with the soundtrack of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC_Hammer  MC Hammer's] [http://lyriki.com/index.php?title=MC_Hammer:U_Can%27t_Touch_This  U Can't Touch This], a thoughtful piece on man's ability to use tools (symbolically the hammer) to manipulate and understand nature.
