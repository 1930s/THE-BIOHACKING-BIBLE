==Sequencing Redos==
*I2057-EX-VR failed again
*I2057-ES-VF failed again
*E0240-ES-VF forward is perfect until 260, all is fine except for the 1bp mutation around 700
*I2056-2-F still has the 1bp insertion at around 20, rest is fine
*I2056-3K3-1F has a 1bp deletion at about 60, rest is fine
*I2055-3K3-1-F perfect until 758, full coverage and scarred
Made overnights of 4 new colonies of I2056 (#4-7), I2057-ES, I2057-EX

==I2055==
*PCR cleaned overnight digest and RBS digests (B0030, 31, 32)
*Has complete go ahead
*Ligated:
**I2055-NOT-EX closed
**I2055-Not-SX closed
**I2055-EX-B0032
**I2055-SX-B0032
**I2055-SX-B0030
**I2055-SX-B0031

I2056 - overnight plates had no growth, seq was bad, will be sending in colonies 4-7 to seq

==I2057==
*Minipreped I2057-ES and I2057-EX and digested E/S and E/X respectively
*Didn't get enough DNA so making another overnight to use
*Also overnighting to seq
*Digested I2057-ES that had been sealed with Not1, cut E/S
*Ligated PCR product cut either ES and EX w/ promoters
**I2057-ES-R0040
**I2057-EX-R0040
**I2057-EX-J100
**I2057-EX-J116
*PCR cleaned I2057-ES E/S digest from today

Made new Kan plates

==F2620==
*Ran gel of overnight PCR - looked good
*PCR cleaned
*F2620-3K3 plate from overnight had no growth
*Digested PCR product Mfe/Xba in buffer 4
*PCR cleaned digest
