==Debrief==
===Testing of DNA constructs===
*Raw results up on the wiki
*Refinfed data and graphs currently being put up
*Data to be given to modelling team for analysis
*Problems with staggering of experiments - results not very useful
**Talk to supervisors
**Try to get longer access to equipment (fluorometer, incubator etc)
**Find out methods to reduce error and variability in results

===Cloning===
*pTet and pLux constructs have been cloned
**> 300&micro;g of each DNA made - enough for all experiments
*LuxR arrived - might be transformed by Wed
**Protocol team to talk to clonning team about details
*pT7-GFP construct being cloned in BL21

===Vesicles===
*New procedure being adapted which works well- not leaving overnight and using 10ml suspension
**Saves ingredients
**No need to leave overnight
*Cell extract will be tested in vesicles tomorrow
*FACS machine for counting vesicles - not sure if can get access
*No concrete decision yet made on where vesicles fit into the project
**Meeting between Dirk (captain vesicles), Ben (captain ID) and Alex (captain CBD) to discuss feasibility of vesicles

===Wiki===
*In the process of being redesigned - Alex and Anthony
**Make wiki more organise and facilitate navigation for visitors
**Talked to Vincent
**Talking to individual groups about sections relevant to them and proposed layout

===AOB===
*'''Characterisation of chassis''' - need to focus on it a bit more
**Modelling and testing within in-vitro and vesicles
**Use literature rather than experiments to characterise chassis being used
**Use the information in in-veso teams(old oraganisation) page
