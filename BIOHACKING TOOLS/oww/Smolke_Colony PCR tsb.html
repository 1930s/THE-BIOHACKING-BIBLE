==Overview==

Colony PCR from yeast, either to check inserts etc. or for sequencing.

==Materials==

*Lyticase (from Sigma)
*TE
*PCR buffers, primers, polymerase, etc.

==Procedure==
The basic idea is breaking the cells with lyticase and heat, then doing PCR.


#Dilute stock of lyticase to 50 U/mL in TE.
#Aliquot lyticase in 50uL quantities
#Pick colonies (I use a pipette tip) and add to lyticase aliquots, pipette up and down or agitate to break up colony
#Incubate at 37&deg;C for 30 min
#Incubate at 95&deg;C for 10 min
#Use as template for PCR - I use 5uL of the cells in a 50uL PCR reaction


==Notes==
*I use this protocol to PCR off the chromosome for sequencing... I clean up the rxn with a Zymoclean kit afterwards.
*The amount of yeast doesn't seem to matter much.  I get success with very small colonies or with loads of cells.
