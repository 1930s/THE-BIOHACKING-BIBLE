*Took out overnight plates of I2056 transformation and saw no more colonies
*PCR of I2055 also evaporated, redoing with 20ul and different tube 
*Got I2057 sequence which matches registry

*Preped colonies 3, 4, and 6 of I2055 for sequencing
**Minipreped and eluted with 30 ul pH 8.5 water instead of EB
**used the 8-tubes, 2 samples of each colony, VR and VF
**Mix: 2ul primer, x ul DNA to make b/t 200 and 500 ng, (10-x)ul water
**Submitted order on dnalims.mit.edu
**Building was locked so it's in the 4 degree

*Digested T9002 with Mfe1
**used buffer 4 and 11 ul T9002

*Need scarring primers for I2056, I2057
**I2056:

**I2057:
***F: CTTAGTAG CAATTG TCACACAGGAAAGTACTAGATGGC (52.1)
