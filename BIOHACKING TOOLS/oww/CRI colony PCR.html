==General Info==
This SOP is a how to guide for PCR from a single colony selected by hand using a toothpick.

==Materials==
*Toothpicks
*Orbital Incubator Shakers
*PCR tubes
*PCR reagents
*MJ Research PCR machines

==Procedure==
#Toothpick colonies/glycerol in 1.2 ml 2 x YT + 50µg/ml Kan for 2 h at 37 ºC shaking in orbital shaker (JGL-SOP-XXX). The medium should look only slightly turbid. Do not grow the cultures for longer because the accumulation of metabolites will interfere with the PCR reaction.
##Remove 2.5µl and return to incubate o/n for Plasmid/Cosmid DNA minipreps of positives for sequencing
##Revise antibiotic for specific vector
#Prepare PCR Mastermix
##25µl total reaction volume
##1.25µl DMSO
##2.5µl WhiB-F primer (1.5µM 10ng/µl)
##2.5µl WhiB-R primer (1.5µM 10ng/µl)
##12.5µl Qiagen Hotstart Mastermix
##6.25µl dH20
##Adjust for number of samples required + one for volume/carry over error. 
##Include positive control DNA sample and negative control no DNA sample.
#Dispense 22.5µl of Mastermix into PCR tubes 
#Add 2.5µl of each bacterial culture into PCR tubes
#Run the PCR reactions using the following programme: 
#PCR Programme: Beth-Colony
##15 min 95ºC x 1 cycle
##30 sec 94ºC |
##45 sec 53ºC |   x 29 cycles
##30 sec 72ºC |
##10 min 72ºC x 1 cycle
##~ 4ºC
##Adjust annealing temperature to the optimum for the specific primers 
##Adjust extension time to the optimum for the product size (30 sec/500bp)
#Run 5µl of PCR product on an E-gel (JGL-SOP-035 and JGL-SOP-036)for 15 min.
