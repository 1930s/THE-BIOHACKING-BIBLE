==DNA Constructs==



===Promoters===
*'''T7 Promoter'''

[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_J34814 BBa_J34814]

Short description: To be used with T7 polymerase BBa_J34811

[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_J34811 BBa_J34811]

*'''pBad Promoter '''

[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_I0500 BBa_I0500]

pBad is an E. coli promoter that is tightly controlled by: 

Inducer: arabinose

Repressor: AraC apparently acts as the repressor 

One study concluded that arabinose can change the conformation of araC and prevent it from successfully binding to and repressing pBad. 


===RBS===
*'''RBS (Elowitz)'''

[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_B0034 BBa_B0034]

Short description: This is the most efficient RBS in the registry, and sets the 1.0 efficiency standard. It is based on the Elowitz repressilator.


===Reporter Gene===

*RFP

*DsRed

*&beta;-Galactosidase

*Luciferase


===Terminator===

*'''Double terminator (B0010-B0012)'''

[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_B0015 BBa_B0015]

Short description: Double terminator consisting of BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012. This is the most commonly used terminator. It seems to be reliable.
forward_efficiency: 0.984  
reverse_efficiency: 0.295

==Other Materials==

*'''Plasmid Vactor pBAC874t'''

[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_J61036 BBa_J61036]

Short description: 



*'''T7 RNApol'''

[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_J34811 BBa_J34811]

Short description: To be used with specal tRNA loading glutamate instead of stop codon (Part BBa_J34812).

*'''tRNA loading Glutamate on stop codon TTT '''
