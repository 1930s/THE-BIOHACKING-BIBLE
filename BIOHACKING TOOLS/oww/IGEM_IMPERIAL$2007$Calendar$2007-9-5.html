==Debrief==

===Data Analysis===
*Currently being carried out by the modelling team
*Some issues with staggered data and the pTet results
**Need to figure out why the results are so variant
**Can only carry on tests on pTet once reasons for the problems are figured out
*Degradation curves seem fine
*Still in the process of putting all the results on the wiki
*Some issues with the way the data is saved and caculations made in excel
**Modelling and experimental design team need to resolve these issues

===Experiments===
*Tested pLux construct with [AHL] of: 3nM, 5nM and 7nM
*Fluorescence seemed to be higher than in earlier experiments even though the concentrations of AHL were higher before
**May be as the DNA used earlier was mini-preped whereas that being used now has been midi-preped
**Need to look into it further
*'''Purification of LuxR''' - growing cells at the moment
**Will make the buffers tomorrow
**Might be done by Friday

===Cloning===
*pT7 has been cloned
*Quality check:
**In-vivo - works
**In-vitro - will be tested on Monday (DNA preparation - Friday)

===Vesicles===
*Home-made cell extract was put in to vesicles
**A lot of green fluorescence was seen but not sure if it was GFP being expressed
*Need working cell extract - exact amount needed to be calculated
**Can use the T7 cell extract and test the pT7 construct in the vessicles (as not enough of the commercial S30)
*Pore protein - found somewhere to buy from cheaply
**If use this one need to change the phospholipid currently being used - and the new phospholipid will need to be tested
**Otherwise need to keep looking for a new pore protein

===GFP===
*The GFP from regisrty E0040 is not wild type - actually a mutant: GFP-mut3b
*Can't get GFP-mut3b from GeneArt, thus can't get the right calibration and degradation curves
