*Reviewed sequencing results:
**None of E0240 worked except E0240-EX, E2. Not sure about ES, M2.
**F2620 isn't right, should try re-ligating and transformibg in DB3.1
**55-SX-B0031 was backwards
**57 ES r0040 #1 is good.
**57 EX "J116" (actually 102): #1 has mutated beginning, #2 could be a poor read
**57 EX R0040: both (1&2) are good.
*Should try more colonies of E0240

*making o/n of B0034 (S/X) I2055. two colonies worked.
**perhaps the S/X construct is too difficult to use?
