== Computational Resources ==

Computational Biology is a big part of our lab.  To facilitate this work, we use two beowulf clusters.  One cluster is a 32 node dual athlon CPU system, the other newer cluster is a 48 node dual Intel CPU system.  For more information, see the [[Computing/BioMicro Cluster|cluster section.]] In addition to the production level clusters, we have an 8 node dual Intel "mini-cluster" for testing and smaller jobs.
