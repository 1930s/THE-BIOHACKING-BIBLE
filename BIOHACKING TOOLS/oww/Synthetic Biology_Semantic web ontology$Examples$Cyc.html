[http://www.cyc.com/technology/whatiscyc_dir/whatsincyc Cyc Knowledge Base] is a formalized representation of a vast quantity of fundamental human knowledge: facts, rules of thumb, and heuristics for reasoning about the objects and events of everyday life.
*[[Wikipedia:Cyc|Cyc]] Wikipedia article
*[[Wikipedia:CycL|CycL]] is the formal language used for knowledge representation
*[http://www.opencyc.org/ OpenCyc] is the open source version of the Cyc technology
*[http://research.cyc.com/ ResearchCyc] has the complete (non-proprietary) content of the Cyc knowledge base

Cyc contains 10s of thousands of predicates, 100s of thousands of concepts and millions of assertions (as of 2006).

Knowledge hiereachy: Upper ontology -> Core theories -> Domain-specific theories -> very specific information

Inference engine consist of 1000 agents that attack every problem & sub-problem

Cyc does not provide definitive proofs: only arguments for and against

Architecture:
*UI - query by people
*Knowledge entry tools - input
*API - query by applications
*External datasources (web pages, other KBs, etc) - machine input

Reasoning: deduction, abduction (inference in reverse) and induction

Public versions:
*OpenCyc - vocabulary of 100,000s terms
*ResearchCyc - everything
