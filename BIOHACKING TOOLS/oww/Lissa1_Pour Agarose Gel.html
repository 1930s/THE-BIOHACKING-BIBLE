#Get the 1% agarose out of the warmer.
#Get a small flask.  Flame the bottom of it.
#Pour around 50 mL of agarose in to the flask.
#Go in to the gel room.  Add 2 uL of ethidium bromide to your flask, using new gloves, and the pipettes in the gel room.
#Pour your gel in to its mold.
#Put in the comb that you need.
#Load your samples.
##Preparing samples:
###Put 4 uL dots of 1x loading buffer on parafilm.
###Add 200 ng of DNA to each dot (works out around 4 uL usually), except for a ladder - add only 1 uL of the ladder.
#Load samples in to gel.
#Run gel at 85 V. 
#Image gel!
