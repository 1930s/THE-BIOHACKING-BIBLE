'''''Caveat emptor!'''''    

This page and protocols were developed by Virginia Rich, graduate student in the DeLong Lab, derived from protocols used in other labs. These derivations are noted within the protocols. 

Please note, microarray protocols can be notoriously tricky. These protocols work for me, but moving between labs previously, etc., I have had to adapt them - sometimes your water source, local level of ozone, humidity, etc. etc. can have an impact on whether your array protocols work.

If you find errors, or can suggest improvements or clarifications, please email me at vrich $at$ mit ^dot^ edu. Others within the lab who develop their own variants of these protocols are encouraged to post them here too with their contact info.
