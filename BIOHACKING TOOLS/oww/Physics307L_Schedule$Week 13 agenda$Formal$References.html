__NOTOC__
==Citing '''original research articles''' (not encyclopedia) is critical for your formal report==
===Most of your references will go in your Introduction and Methods, with a few elsewhere===
===If a wikipedia (or other website) has a particularly good article that helped you, you should also cite it (cite the "permalink" for wikipedia).===
==Example: Speed of light==
===Citations within wikipedia not great===
===[http://scholar.google.com Google Scholar], Start with "Essen"===
===When you find good references, add them to wikipedia!===
