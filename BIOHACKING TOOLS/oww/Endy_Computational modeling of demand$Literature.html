Harcum <cite>Harcum</cite> built a structured but non-segragated metabolic model to examine the effect of recombinant protein production on amino acid supplies.  Her model built on the earlier Cornell <cite>Shuler1984</cite> models and the later models developed by Bentley, Ramirez and Kompala<cite>Bentley</cite>.  The species modeled were - 5 amino acid pools, native proteins, recombinant proteins, chromosomal DNA, plasmid DNA, ribosomes, lipids and nucleotides.  Glucose was the only substrate modeled.  Growth rate was calculated from the accumulation rate of the species pools.  The effect of producing two different proteins was examined and the shortages in amino acids that resulted agreed with earlier experiments.
