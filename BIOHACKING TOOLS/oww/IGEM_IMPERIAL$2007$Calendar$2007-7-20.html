== Proposals ==

== Task List ==
==== Students ====

Continue expanding list of new HRP literature <br>
Continue characterization of HRP <br>
Expand on contingency ideas (propose 3rd project) <br> 
Expand on HRP application ideas <br>
Develop outlines of proposal presentations for Monday <br>
Discuss proposal for database of experiments <br>
Discuss considerations raised during Thursday's debriefing: <br><br>

'''Considerations''':
<br><br>''Glucose/Insulin System'' 

*Currently proposed receptor: for Glucose-6-P. Receptor available for glucose? 
*Nature of signal required to secrete insulin - pulse or other?

<br>''Thermogenic System''
*Will this plasma-based enzyme system lead to clumping (due to hydrophobicity) - efficiency issues
*Look into alternative enzyme system which could be located intracellularly
*Investigate actual thermogenic reaction - will the reaction catalyzed actually produce heat? Literature based?

== Questions ==


== Debriefing ==

====Presentation/Discussion of Ideas====
<br>
'''1.  pH sensor ''' (new)<br>
<br>
''Problems/Considerations''
*Effects of environmental pH on
**cell growth
**induction of Pcad

*Time-scale of operation <br>
Currently proposed system takes approximately 7 hours to reach steady-state. Look into faster/better pH sensing system

*Possibility of incorporating a control system for pH
<br>

'''2.  Thermosensing-Thermogenic system '''<br> 
<br>
''Problems/Considerations''
* Check genebank for sequence of J45503?
* Possibility for implementation of ATC?
* Time scale. Propose different mechanism to accelerate this function
* Incorporation of cold-shock element
**Look into exploitable endothermic reactions
* Range of operation (currently 30-37 degrees Celsius). Look into extension of range
<br>
'''3.  Biofilms ''' (new)<br>
<br>
''Problems/Considerations''
*Adhesion mechanics - pili, fimbrae, other?
*Applications?

<br>
====HRP Characterization====
* A indirect method for measuring PoPS in/out was proposed, using a GFP/RFP system. This was discussed with Frank.
* The experiments, including equipment to be used, required were also discussed with Frank
* Continue expanding on literature related to HRP 
** Research the strength of repression offerred by HrpV
** Leakiness of promoters involved in HRP system? 
** Look into relevant parameters involved in characterization

====Modelling====
*Look into available programs, including CellDesigner
*Look into stochastic pi-calculus?
*Start drawing model involved in HRP characterization, e.g. relation of PoPS IN/OUT to [GFP]/[RFP], etc.

====Presentation Details====
*Details of presentations taking place on Monday were discussed
