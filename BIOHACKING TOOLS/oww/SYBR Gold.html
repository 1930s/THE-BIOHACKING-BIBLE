'''Recommended by [[Molecular Cloning]] as the best of the SYBR dyes from Molecular Probes.'''

==General information==
*ten-fold more sensitive than ethidium bromide.
*greater dynamic range.
*penetrates gels quickly.
*Stains both DNA and RNA in conventional neutral polyacrylamide and agarose gels and in denaturing gels using urea, glyoxal or formaldehyde.
*stain gels post-electrophoresis because SYBR Gold likely binds the charge phosphate backbone of nucleic acids altering the electrophoretic mobility significantly.  (DNA bands can come out curved).
*low background so no destaining is necessary.
*can be excited at by standard transillumination at 300nm.
*stained nucleic acids can be transferred to membranes for Northerns or Southerns.
*doesn't inhibit most enzymatic reactions except PCR.  PCR is sensitive to high dye concentrations.  Address this issues by adjusting Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration or remove stain via ethanol precipitation.
*very expensive
*supplied at 10,000X concentration in anhydrous DMSO.
*operates most efficiently between pH 7-8.5
*stock solution is stable 6 months to 1 year at <= 20&deg;C
