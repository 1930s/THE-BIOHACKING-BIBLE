==Sequencing==
Made glycerols, minipreped, and sent for sequencing w/ VF and VR
*E0240-1AK3 Colonies 1 and 2
*I2055-1AK3 #4 and #16 
*E0240-3K3 #9
*I2057-3K3 #2 and #4
*I2055-3K3 #3
*and 2 of Jason's 507 and 528
Also sent T9002-3K3 #12 for seq with VF, VR, and internal primers

==PCR==
*Made 8 cell suspensions of I2055-3K3 and ran 10ul rxns of them w/ taq and a 1:30 ext time
*PCR'ed I2056 to scar and add in promoter
**Diluted I2056_R0040_F to 40 ul
**Also used I2055_R
**1 100ul rxn at 53 w/ vent
*PCRed E0240 portion of T9002 1 100ul rxn w/ vent at 54
*Set up overnight BB PCR of E0240-3K3
**1 100ul w/ vent at 53.5, 2:30 ext time

==F2620==
*PCR cleaned digests of F2620 (M/N), 1AK3 (E/P), 3K3 (E/P)
*Ligated F2620-1AK3 and F2620-3K3
*Transformed 3ul of each ligation and plated

==Gels==
[[Image:07.07.17.jpg|thumb|left|Gradient T9002-E0240 PCR]]
*Ran gel of overnight gradient pcr of T9002_E0240 (gel 1) - looked good
*Ran gel of today's pcr's 
**Loaded: Lad, Sp, I2056, Sp, I2055-3K3 (colonies 1-8)
*Made an overnight of Colony #1 to sequence
