== Planned courses: ==

Univ. of Ljubljana, Slovenia: Marko Dolinar and Roman Jerala plan to start a course within MSc Biochemistry programme (i.e. 4th year Biochemistry equivalent) 

Technical University of Valencia, Spain: Emilio Navarro and Arnau Montagud prepare a 40-hours course that will run as an open course for students with different backgrounds either biological or technical, from whichever University. It is planned to be a basic 'Introduction to SB' that will cover the 'topics one must know' to be an iGEM competitor.

Univ. of Lethbridge, Canada: Hans-Joachim Wiedner plans to start a course in 2009-10 within Nano-science multidisciplinary major.
