=Liver Tissue Crosslinking=
Revised 20 May 2007 -- Odom laboratory @ CRUK CRI

===This is a simplified protocol===


Note: We will FedEx you the correct amount of Solutions A, B, C, D in advance.

Process a maximum of 5mls of minced tissue in a 50ml starstedt tube.
*Do not pool livers from different individuals into one tube.  

Step 1: Mix Solution A with Solution B.
*Add 1 volume of Solution B (caution: contains formaldehyde) into 9 volumes of Solution A for a 1:10 dilution.
*For example: for 4 mouse livers you would mix 20 mls solution B with 180 mls Solution A.
*Mix the right amount of solution A+B no more than 5 minutes before the procedure.
*Anesthetize animal terminally, and begin procedure after complete non responsiveness.

Step 2: Flush liver and quickly flash freeze small portion of tissue.
*If possible, flush liver with Solution D (optionally adding heparin if you have it on hand) to remove blood (this step is preferred, but optional).
*Remove approximately 4, 0.5mm chunks of tissue and flash freeze in a well-labeled eppendorf tube (dry ice or liquid nitrogen if available).
*This will be used for RNA isolation so avoid cross contamination between samples if possible. 

Step 3:  Continue to mince liver into Solution A+B.
*Mince/slice liver into pieces thinner than 3 mm with razor blade or scalpel.
*Place tissue in a 50ml tube and immediately add Solution A+B. No more than about 5-6 ml of tissue should be added to a 50 ml tube.
*It is important to get the minced tissue into Solution A+B as quickly as possible.

Step 4:  Incubate 20 minutes.
*With occasional gentle shaking/stirring, let the tissues sit in Solution A+B for exactly 20 minutes at room temperature.

Step 5:  Rinse with Solution C.
*Drain off the Solution A+B by pouring off the solution through the metal collander provided.
**The liver should remain in the 50 ml tube, but if it doesnâ€™t the colander will catch it and you can place any lost bits back into the 50 ml tube.
*Cover the minced liver with 50 ml of solution C. Let sit for exactly 10 minutes with occasional gentle shaking/stirring.

Step 6:  Rinse with Solution D.
*Drain the Solution C off as above, rinse for 1-2 minutes with Solution D, drain, and freeze on dry ice or in LN2 in well-labelled tubes.
*On the tubes, please have the animal tracking number, and date of liver processing.  

Step 7:  Freeze and ship!
*Plastics and leftover solutions can be disposed of as desired. Please ship us the tissues on dry ice.
