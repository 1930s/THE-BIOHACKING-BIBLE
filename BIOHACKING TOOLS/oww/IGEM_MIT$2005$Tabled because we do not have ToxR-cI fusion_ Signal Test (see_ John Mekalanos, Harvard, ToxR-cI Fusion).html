*scFv-ToxR-cI-Reporter fusion
**Check for fusion of scFv doesn't cause dimerization or block dimerization
**Then test for different length linkers of fluoreceins. (can be synthesized for us invitro)
***Which one cause transcription of reporter? (test constructs)
**[http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1365-2958.1999.01173.x ToxR co-operative interactions are not modulated by environmental conditions or periplasmic domain conformation, Michelle Dziejman]
*When ToxR dimerizes, the proteins attached to ToxR can bind to DNA to bring it together or not. 
*Can see BetaGal or not. 
**(plates) Xgal -> "x" = blue + galactose
**(liquid) ONPG -> ONP (yellow A420) + galactose
***Parallel: build ctx promoter with reporter.
*<b>We can test this now</b>. We just need the plasmid and strains. .
*Does it autodimerize? Figure out natural behaviors
