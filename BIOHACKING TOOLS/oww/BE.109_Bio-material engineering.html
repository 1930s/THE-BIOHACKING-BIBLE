==Module 4==

'''Instructors:''' Angela Belcher and [[Natalie Kuldell]]

'''TA:''' [[Eileen Higham]]

In this experimental module you will study an unusual protein, one that allows yeast to bind a metal, gold. Over the next few weeks you will purify yeast based on this binding property, and then you’ll vary some experimental condition to improve the yeast/gold interaction. Using your optimized conditions, you will screen a library of yeast to isolate a new gold-binding strain. The DNA encoding your new gold-binding protein will be sequenced and, with any luck, you’ll elucidate some amino acid requirements for the yeast/metal interaction.
