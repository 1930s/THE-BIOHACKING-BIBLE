 
'''Plant material:'''In vitro plants of Nicotiana tabacum L. cv Wisconsin 38 
 
'''Day 1 Prepare bacteria:''' 
• Streak YM plus antibiotic plates with bacteria. 
• Incubate plates for 2-3 days at 28°C. 
 
'''Day 3 Transformation:'''

• Measure about 20mL Minimal A medium for each bacterial strain. 

• Scrape or wash bacteria from plate with sterile loop and suspend in 
20mL of Minimal A. 

• Adjust density to an OD600 0.9-1.0. 

• Take first healthy fully expanded leaves from 4-5 week old tissue 
culture grown tobacco plant, cut into 0.5cm squares (or can use a cork 
borer, which is about 1.0cm diameter) in deep petri dish, under sterile 
RMOP liquid medium. Store tissue pieces in RMOP in deep petri dish. 

• Transfer leaf pieces (about 20 per transformation) to deep petri dish 
containing bacterial suspension.  

• Swirl to ensure bacteria has contacted cut edge of leaf and let stand for 
5 minutes. 

• Remove leaf pieces from suspension and blot dry on filter paper or on 
the edge of the container. 

• Place leaf pieces with adaxial side (upper leaf surface) on solid RMOP, 
about 10 pieces per plate. 

• Incubate plates in dark at 28°C for: 
2-3 days A. tumefaciens 
5 days S. meliloti 
5 days M. loti 
5-11 days Rhizobium sp. NGR234 
 
'''Day 6-14 Selection:''' 

• Transfer leaf pieces onto solid RMOP-TCH, with abaxial surface (lower 
surface of leaf) in contact with media. 

• Incubate plates for 2-3 weeks in the light at 28°C, with 16 hours 
daylight per day. 

• Subculture every 2 weeks.  
 
'''Plantlet formation:''' 

• When shoots appear transfer to MST-TCH pots. 

• Incubate plantlets with 16 hours daylight for 1-2 weeks. 

• When roots form the plants can be transferred to soil in the 
glasshouse.  

• Plants can be maintained in tissue culture but will need to be 
subcultured every two weeks. This is done by cutting the growing tip of 
plant, removing excess leaves and transferring this to fresh media.
