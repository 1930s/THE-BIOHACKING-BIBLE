Looks like hit SS @ ~15,000 cells in the reactor volume (10nL).  This is 1.5*10^9 cells/ml.

== Experiment on 6/9 to 6/13/05 ==

===Experimental Conditions===
*Strain: [[Genotypes#MC4100|MC4100]]
*Device: I7101
*Media: [[Knight:M9 supplemented media|Supplemented M9]] + [[Ampicillin|Amp]]
*Temp: 37C

===Chemostat Operating Conditions===
*Same as [[SortoStat#Experiment on 06/07/2005|6/7 experiment]].
**Except dilution rate varied from D=0.3 to 0.6 and the min pump period for D=0.6 was set to 50s.  Cleaning period and sorting period varied for each dilution rate.

''Darker lines are moving average with 10 time point window.''

Looked pretty good.  Probably should have left longer at D=0.5 (first time) to see where the SS was exactly since it looks like the cell count may still have been decreasing.  Cell counts were determined by processing of FL images as shown [[Sortostat Image Processing|here]].
