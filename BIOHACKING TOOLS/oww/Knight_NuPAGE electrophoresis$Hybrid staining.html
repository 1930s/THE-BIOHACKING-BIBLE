==Overview==
A fast protocol for visualizing bands on a polyacrylamide gel via coomassie-like staining.

==Materials==
*Deionized water
*[http://www.invitrogen.com/content.cfm?pageid=9869 Invitrogen SimplyBlue SafeStain]
*Microwave
*Plastic tray
**''Use lid of a 1000&mu;L pipette tip box.''
*Orbital shaker
*Kimwipes

==Procedure==
#Add 100mL deionized water in staining tray.
#Microwave staining tray loosely covered for 30 secs on high.
#Shake staining tray for 1 min on orbital shaker at room temperature.
#Discard water.
#Repeat steps 1-4 two more times.
#Add 20mL SimplyBlue SafeStain (enough to just cover the gel).
#Microwave staining tray loosely covered for 20 secs on high.
#Shake staining tray for 5 mins on orbital shaker at room temperature.
#*''You should now be able to see most of the bands on the gel.''
#Place staining tray with gel inside a ziploc bag to limit evaporation.
#Incubate overnight on orbital shaker at room temperature.
#*''Overnight incubation will yield better sensitivity due to darker staining.''
#Discard SimplyBlue SafeStain.
#Add 100mL deionized water.
#Add 2 kimwipes.
#Shake staining tray for 2-3 hours on orbital shaker at room temperature.
#Take gel picture.
#Add 20mL 20% NaCl for at least 5 mins.
#*''Only do this step if you aren't planning on drying the gel!  Otherwise, when the gel dries, you will see a white salt precipitate.''
#Gel can be stored in salt solution for several weeks.
