==Day 2 - Fixation/Spheroblasting/Dehydration/Primary Antibody Incubation/Secondary Antibody Pre-Absorbing==

*Important notes 
**No Triton in buffers 
**Fix cells before spheroplasting, do not use coverslips – just use humid chambers (even gentle removal of coverslips will strip the cells right off your slides)
*Before Immunofluorescence
**Polylysine coat slides by adding 10 µl polylysine solution (1mg/ml in H<sub>2</sub>O) to each well on slide. Dilute the lab stock of polylysine from 0.3% to 0.1% to make 1mg/ml.  Incubate at room temp for 10 min.  Remove the polylysine and wash 2x with H<sub>2</sub>O and allow to air dry
**Make 20% paraformaldehyde (takes ~30 min, see below)
**Make YEPD/1.2 M Sorbitol
===Fixation===
#Fix cells in growth medium for 10 min at 30°C in 4% paraformaldehyde (PF) before spheroplasting.  To a 50 ml culture, add 10 ml of 20% PF
#*For 50 ml 20% PF:   
#**10 g PF
#**30 ml ddH<sub>2</sub>O
#**50 µl 10N NaOH
#***Dissolve at 62°C in closed tube for about 30 min shaking
#***Once dissolved, add 10 g sorbitol and ddH<sub>2</sub>O up to 50 ml
#Transfer cells to 50 ml conicals (mostly fits, lose ~1 ml)
#*pellet 2,400 rpm for 5 min at RT
#Resuspend the pellet in 40 ml YEPD/1.2 M sorbitol, then pellet the cells for 5 min at 2,400 rpm
#*For 500 ml YEPD/1.2 M sorbitol 
#**400 ml YEPD
#**110 g sorbitol
#***Dissolve sorbitol (needs heating)
#***Bring volume up to 500 ml with YEPD
#***Filter
#Resuspend the pellet in 1 ml YEPD/1.2 M sorbitol and transfer to 1.5 ml tube
#Pellet at 2,000 rpm for 2 min at RT and remove supernatant
===Spheroblasting===
#Resuspend the cells in 1 ml of 100 mM EDTA-KOH pH 8.0 and 10 mM DTT
#*For 50 ml
#**39.5 ml ddH<sub>2</sub>O
#**10 ml 0.5 M EDTA-KOH (pH 8.0)
#**500 µl 1 M DTT
#Incubate the tubes at 30°C for 10 min with no shaking, gently invert a couple times
#Collect the cells by centrifuging at 2,500 rpm for 2 min at RT
#Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of YEPD/1.2 M sorbitol.  To resuspend evenly, start with 500 µl
#Add lyticase to 1000 Units/ml and zymolase (100T) to 400 µg/ml of fixed cells
#*For 1 ml of cells add
#**20 µl lyticase (50 Units/µl)
#***Resuspend 50,000 units lyticase (one bottle) in 1 ml ddH<sub>2</sub>O – gently pipet, do not vortex – makes 50 Units/µl
#**40 µl zymolyase (of 10 µg/µl)
#***Use 10 mg/ml zymolase (stock)
#Incubate at 30°C with no shaking.  Monitor spheroplast formation at 5, 10, 15, and 20 min. (~ 10 min works well)
#To check, mix 4 µl of cells with 4 µl 1% SDS on a glass slide and observe the number of cell "ghosts" under microscope.  This is very hard to do – usually just go on timing  
#Harvest cells before complete spheroplasting (~80%)
#Centrifuge for 1 min at 2,500 rpm at RT
#Wash twice in 1 ml YEPD/1.2 M sorbitol.
#Resuspend spheroplasts in 0.8 ml YEPD.  This concentration of cells should be such that only one layer of non-confluent cells will adhere to the slide
#Leave a drop on each spot (~10 µl) of a super-Teflon (pre-polylysine coated) slide for 5 min to allow the spheroplasts to adhere to the glass surface.  Do not throw away unused spheroplasts – keep on ice for later pre-clearing of secondary antibody
#Take away as much liquid as possible using a pipette and let air dry for 2 min
#Check that cells are there by light microscopy
===Dehydration===
#Perform methanol and acetone washes in Coplin jars (blot off extra liquid from ends of slides)
#Put the slides in -20°C methanol for 6 min
#Transfer the slides to -20°C acetone for 30 sec
#Air dry for 3-5 min
===Primary Antibody Incubation===
#Cover each spot with 10 µl of 1x PBS/1% ovalbumin for at least 10 min 
#*For 10 ml
#**9.0 ml ddH<sub>2</sub>O
#**1 ml 10x PBS
#**100 mg ovalbumin
#*After this step the cells should appear transparent and the nucleus can be seen as a dark spot.  This is an indication of good spheroplasting
#Pipet off PBS/1% ovalbumin and cover each spot on the slide with 10 µl of the appropriate antibody diluted in PBS (antibody originally used for NPC staining was MAb414)
#*Found that a strain containing a myc-tagged NPC component gave much better NPC staining at the end when using an anti-myc antibody rather than MAb414
#* For MAb414 1:5000 in PBS
#**1 µl MAb414 
#**5 ml PBS/1% ovalbumin (see above)
#Incubate for 1 hr at 37°C in humid chamber or overnight at 4°C 
#*Humid Chamber
#**We use tip boxes – soak paper towels and place them under the tip holder - place slide on top of tip holder – tape top and bottom together to seal the box
===Secondary Antibody Pre-absorbing===
#Use the remaining fixed spheroplasts by washing them 3 x 1 ml in cold PBS and resuspending them in 1 ml of cold PBS
#Dilute the secondary antibody (594(RED) anti-mouse for MAb414 - stock is usually 1 mg/ml) 1:1000 in the spheroplast suspension and incubate for 1 hr on a rotating wheel in the dark
#Centrifuge at top speed, collect the supernatant (containing the secondary antibody) and store at 4°C

==Day 3 - Washes/Secondary Antibody Incubation and Fixation/RNase A Treatment==
*Make fresh 20% paraformaldehyde before starting
===Washes===
#Carefully remove the slide from the humid chamber
#Wash each spot 3 x 5 min (10 µl) in 1x PBS at RT
===Secondary Antibody Incubation and Fixation===
#Pipet off washes and cover each spot with 10 µl of the pre-absorbed secondary antibody and incubate at 37°C in the humid chamber in the dark for 1.5 hr
#Wash each spot 3 x 5 min in 1x PBS at RT
#Post-fix the cells by adding drops (10 µl) of 4x SSC + 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at RT
#*Important when continuing with FISH as the primary and secondary antibodies tend to dissociate under the harsh conditions of ''in situ''
#*For 1 ml 
#**200 µl 20x SSC
#**200 µl 20% paraformaldehyde (made fresh)
#**600 µl ddH<sub>2</sub>O
#Wash each spot 3 x 3 min in 4x SSC (10 µl per spot)
#*For 1 ml 
#**200 µl 20x SSC
#**800 µl ddH<sub>2</sub>O
===RNase A Treatment===
#Apply 4x SSC + 20 µg/ml RNase A to each spot
#*For 1 ml
#**200 µl 20x SSC
#**2 µl 10 mg/ml RNase A (10 mg/ml, breboiled)
#**800 µl ddH<sub>2</sub>O
#Incubate overnight at RT (in the dark – humid chamber)

==Day 4 - Dehydration/Probe Hybridization==
===Dehydration===
*Use Coplin jars for ddH<sub>2</sub>O wash and dehydration
#Wash slides in H<sub>2</sub>O
#Dehydrate slides in Coplin jars containing 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% ethanol (-20°C) for 1 min each 
#Air dry
#Add 10 µl per spot 2x SSC + 70% formamide (cover ALL the spots – lots of liquid)
#*For 1 ml
#**100 µl 20x SSC
#**700 µl deionized formamide (100%)
#**200 µl ddH<sub>2</sub>O
#Incubate at 72°C for 5 min
#*Our trick is to place the slide on top of an aluminum block that is partially submerged in a 72°C water bath.  Allow a few drops of water to spread under the slide by capillary action – in between the glass and aluminum – for better heat conductance
#Dehydrate slides in Coplin jars containing 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% ethanol (-20°C) for 1 min each 
#Air dry
#Check that you still have cells, unfortunately this is not a joke :)
===Probe Hybridizing===
#Make hybridization solution
#*For 800 µl of hyb solution
#**500 µl deionized formamide
#**200 µl 50% dextran sulfate
#**100 µl 20x SSC
#Resuspend each pellet with 40 µl ddH<sub>2</sub>O
#Combine resuspended pellet with 160 µl of hyb solution
#*200 µl total gives probe concentration of 10 ng/µl if started with 2 µg
#**The optimal concentration of probe depends on the sequence and must be determined empirically.  Put hyb solution (without probe) on other spots to keep enough moisture around
#Apply 10 µl of the pellet/hyb solution mix to each spot
#Incubate for 10 min at 72°C
#Incubate for 24-60 hr (greater than 40 usually) at 37°C in dark
#*Place in humid chamber with several drops of hyb solution (without probe) in the wells to maintain internal humidity.  Tape everything shut to avoid evaporation

==Day 5 - Washes/Secondary Antibody Incubation Round 2/Coverslip==
===Washes===
#Preheat 0.05x SSC at 40°C (water bath) – also preheat aluminum block in water 
#*For 1 ml   
#**2.5 µl 20x SSC
#**997.5 µl ddH<sub>2</sub>O
#Remove slides from humid chamber and wash twice with 0.05x SSC for 5 min at 40°C (10-20 µl drops on each spot) – place on partially submerged aluminum block in water bath
#Keep the hyb chamber in the 37°C incubator (keep it warm – will need it at 37°C again later)
#Incubate spots in BT buffer (0.15 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5) + 0.05% BSA for 2 x 30 min at 37°C in the dark – don’t immerse slide, just place drops on individual spots
