== General comments ==

This protocol is used to clone DNA fragements and PCR products into the yeast genome by homologous recombination. It is a much simplified version of the [http://www.umanitoba.ca/faculties/medicine/units/biochem/gietz/method.html| high efficiency yeast transformation protocol]. This protocol works usually fine to replace selection markers, create knockouts or add tags via homologous recombination.
To transform yeast with plasmids we use the [[Freimoser:Protocols:FastYeastTransformation|fast yeast transformation]] protocol.


== Preparation of "competent" yeast cells ==

# Make a 3 mL overnight culture of the required strains in YPD
# The next day inoculate 5 mL YPD medium with 1 OD<sub>600</sub> yeast cells (so that the final OD<sub>600</sub> will be 0.2)
# Let this culture grow for 2-3 h (the OD<sub>600</sub> should be 0.8-1.2, often we take the culture after 3 h without measuring the OD<sub>600</sub> since this proofed fine for most strains)
# spin down the cells and resuspend the pellet in 5 mL H<sub>2</sub>O
# spin down the cells and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL 100 mM LiAc
# spin down the cells


== Transformation ==

# Add the following to the pellet (in the order indicated):
## 240 μL PEG
## 36 μL LiAc (1M)
## 50 μL carrier DNA
## x μL DNA
## 34-x μL H<sub>2</sub>O
# vortex 1 min (if the pellet is not resuspended use a pipette)
# heat shock: 42°C, 40 min
# spin: 6000-8000 rpm, 15s
# remove liquid, add 800 μl YPD and leave 2 h at 30°C
# spin down cells (5000 rpm, 3 min) plate everything


== Material: ==

*carrier DNA: salmon/herring sperm DNA in H<sub>2</sub>O, 2 mg/ml stock, 500 μl aliquots, heat-inactivated at 95°C for 5-6 min and put on ice before use (has to be done once).
*50% poly-ethylen-glycol (PEG) (MW 33-50) solution, filter-sterilized
*1 M Li-Acetate, autoclaved
*0.1 M Li-Acetate, autoclaved
