*Took out overnight transformation plates
** both the sequential and double digests of T9002 and 3K3 had lots of colonies
**E0240-3K3 had lots of colonies, E0240-1AK3 had two
**I2055-1AK3 had lots of colonies, I-1AT3 and I-1AC3 had none


*Made cell suspensions of 4 T-3K3 colonies, 4 I-1AK3 colonies, 4 E-3K3, and 2 E-1AK3
*Did a 10 ul colony PCR on each cell suspensions
**Used 2min elongation time because T9002 is 2261bp b/t VF and VR


*Ran gel of I2055 and got a bright band just under 1kb
**Not sure if it contains promoter or not
*PCR cleaned I2055
*Double digested I2055 with Mfe1 and Nsi1 
**Used buffer 2 and 4ul DNA


*Overnight liquid cultures of I2056 still didn't grow (maybe lost Amp resistance?) 
*Made new overnights of I2056 containing only Tet


*Did a 2-way ligation of T9002 and 1AK3
*Transformed 3ul of the ligation and plated on Kan
