==Michaelis-Menton Kinetics==

===Introduction===

Michaelis-Menten kinetics describes the kinetics of many enzymes. 

[[Image:icgems_steadystate.png|frame|Reaction at Steady State]]

Assumptions of Model:
*[Enzyme] is much less than the [Substrate]
*Enzyme is not allosteric.
*Reaction is in steady state
*Equilibrium favours product over transition complex.

===Derivation of MM===

Consider the following reaction:

[[Image:icgems_mm1.png|200px]]

k<sub>1</sub> and k<sub>3</sub> are forward rate constants.
k<sub>2</sub> and k<sub>4</sub> are backward rate constants.


1. Rate of formation of ES: '''k<sub>1</sub>[E][S] + k<sub>4</sub>[E][P]'''

However, we assume k<sub>3</sub> ≫ k<sub>4</sub>, i.e. the equilibrium favours product over transition complex, so we ignore the term with k<sub>4</sub> in it.


2. Rate of removal of ES: '''k<sub>2</sub>[ES] + k<sub>3</sub>[ES]'''


3. In the steady state, rate of formation of ES = rate of removal of ES:

'''k<sub>1</sub>[E][S] = k<sub>2</sub>[ES] + k<sub>3</sub>[ES]'''

If we rearrange this to get all the rate constants on one side and all the concentration terms on the other, we can define a constant called Km, which is the Michaelis constant:

'''K<sub>m</sub> = (k<sub>2</sub>+k<sub>3</sub>) / k<sub>1</sub> = [ES] / [E][S]'''


4. We can’t measure [E] (free enzyme) or [ES] easily, but we do know the total enzyme concentration, as that is what we will have added when we made up our enzyme solution.

'''[E] = [E]T – [ES]'''

If we substitute this into our definition of Km and rearrange it, we get:

'''[ES] = [E]T[S] / ([S]+K<sub>m</sub>)'''


5. The overall (initial) reaction rate V is

'''V = k<sub>3</sub>[ES]'''

If we substitute this into the last result, we get: 

'''V = k<sub>3</sub>[E]T[S] / ([S]+K<sub>m</sub>)'''


6. When the enzyme is saturated, [ES]=[E]T, so we can define a maximum velocity, V<sub>m</sub>:

'''V<sub>m</sub> = k<sub>3</sub>[E]T'''


And this gives us our final result:

===MM Parameters===

[[Image:icgems_mm0.png|frame|Michaelis-Menton Kinetics]]

V<sub>m</sub> (or Vmax) is the maximum rate at which a certain mass of enzyme can work, and equals k<sub>3</sub> (the rate constant for [ES] degradation to product) times the total enzyme concentration [E]T. Fast enzymes have higher V<sub>m</sub>. V<sub>m</sub> is not a constant, because it is dependent on the amount of enzyme present in a solution, and on the volume of this solution. It is measured in mol s<sub>-1</sub> or more usually μmol min<sub>-1</sub>.

K<sub>m</sub> is (k<sub>2</sub>+k<sub>3</sub>) / k<sub>1</sub> = [E][S] / [ES], i.e. K<sub>m</sub> is the K<sub>eq</sub> for the non-productive dissociation of the ES complex back to E and S. A low K<sub>m</sub> indicates the enzyme has a high affinity for its substrate. Therefore efficient enymes have lower K<sub>m</sub>. K<sub>m</sub> is a constant: it equals [S] at ½V<sub>m</sub>, and is measured in mol L<sub>-1</sub>, or more usually mM.
