==To Do==
*Digest E0240 with Mfe1 and Nsi1
*PCR Clean E0240
*Ligate E and 3K3, transform?
*Colony PCR green T, and redo blue C gel
*Miniprep B0032?

==Overnights==
*B0032 has good growth
*Also saw colonies on green T (promoter tester on Tet)

==Digest==
*NEB recommends not double digesting Mfe1 and Nsi1
*Doing a sequential digest Mfe1 then Nsi1
*used 3ul of the scarred E0240 in the Mfe1 digest and all of the digested product in the 2nd (Nsi) digest
*Mfe1 requires buffer 4 and Nsi1 requires buffer 3
*Did a PCR cleanup in between the two digests

==Colony PCR==
*Did a colony PCR on the 2 green (promoter tester) T colonies
*Redid the colony PCR on the 7 blue (RBS tester) C colonies
*Used VF and VR 40 uM primers
*Made new 2.5uM dNTP's
