===General Updates===
*Who's leaving? Who's coming back? When
:Jen - leaving today - back when school starts
:Maxine - leaving Tuesday
:Annie - leaving Tuesday
:Will - ?
:Ray - left due to illness
:Jessica - back on Monday
*Semester meeting schedule - Let's try Friday at 5pm. The meetings will necessarily be short. We can always try something else.

===Subteam Updates===
====Input-Maxine====
*Doing experiment on microscope today
*Is there any access to any other fluorescent microscope?  I waited a few days to use it.

====Head Unit-Jen====
*Backtracked a few weeks, decided to not just use the PCR product, but instead put it into vector
*Made new Biobricks (need to be specified) consisting of ATG-scFv (x3)
*To do: assembly with promoter::RBS construct, western blot testing.
*Does someone want to take over? If so we need to talk about it <b>today</b>.

====ToxR-Will====
====FecA-Annie====
*Construction of FecA Pro-RFP, FecA Pro-GFP
:Failed once
:Did again and got lots of colonies for Feca Pro-GFP, but 2 - controls got some colonies as well.
:-Having Registry assembling as well
*PhoA
:2nd QuikChange no colonies
:Problems:
::Optimized version of PhoA in Registry, 81% similarity by BLAST
::PhoA Registry has 1 PstI & 1 EcoRI site. PhoA NCBI has 2 EcoRI sites. Diagnosis digestion confirmed this. 
::All primers designed for PhoA (PCR & restriction sites removal) were based on PhoA Registry
:Solution:
::Reorder primers to PCR and remove restriction sites to get the "real" PhoA
*FecA
:3rd QuikChange resulted in no colonies
:Doing 3-step PCR (running gel to confirm)
*scFv-Linker
:confirming whether or not Linker was added
:ordered primers for sequencing

====Signal Processing-Ray====
====Actuator-Jessica====
*ToxR system:
:ctx assembled w/ GFP
:ctx assembling w/ RFP
*FecA system: parallel
:FecA Promoter assembling w/ RFP
:FecA Promoter assembling w/ GFP
