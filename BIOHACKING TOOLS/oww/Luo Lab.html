'''Welcome to the Luo Lab wiki at OpenWetWare''' <br>



We are a newly formed research group in the Department of Biomedical Engineering of Peking University in Beijing China.  The primary focus of the Luo Lab is using interdisciplinary strategies to develop functional biomaterials that can interact with tissues and cells through controlled mechanisms at the molecular level.  New materials are designed, synthesized and fabricated into various forms for different biomedical applications.  We are especially interested in developing technologies for stem cells, regenerative medicine and targeted drug delivery.  The Luo Lab carries out both fundamental and applied research and is dedicated to bridging knowledge boundaries for discovery and development of new methods and therapies.
