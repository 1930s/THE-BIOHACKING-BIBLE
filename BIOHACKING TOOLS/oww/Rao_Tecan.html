=Overview=
The Tecan Safire2 is a multi-functional microtiter plate reader useful for the measurement of bulk absorbance, fluorescence and luminescence. In the our lab, we primarily use this instrument to measure bulk gene expression in live bacterial cells using fluorescence (fluorescing proteins) or luminescence (bacterial luciferase - <i>Photorhabdus luminescens</i> lux operon). Advantages of these systems versus traditional Î²-galactosidase (lacZ/bgaB) measurements include: i) the ability to correlate gene expression in bulk to single cell measurements (flow cytometry, quantitative microscopy) ii) the ability to make convenient time -course gene expression measurements under a varied set of environmental conditions.

=Usage=
To use the Tecan Safire2 in the Rao Lab, here are a simple set of instructions. If you need more explicit methods or
