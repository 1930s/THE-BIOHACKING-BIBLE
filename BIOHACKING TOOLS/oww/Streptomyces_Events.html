The first biannual, one day Streptomyces meeting was held on 17th September 2007, at the University of East Anglia (UEA) and was sponsored by the Norwich Research Park.
These events will be hosted alternately by UEA and the JIC (John Innes Centre) within the NRP (Norwich Research Park). They will consist of a series of short talks by postgrads, postdocs and invited speakers. 

All are welcome.
