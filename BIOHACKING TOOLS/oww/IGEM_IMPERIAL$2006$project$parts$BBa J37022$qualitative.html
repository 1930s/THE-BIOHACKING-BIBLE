==Aims==
*'''To show that the aiiA can degrade AHL'''

==Outline==

*Culture <bbpart>J37022</bbpart> overnight with AHL
*The next day mesure AHL content of the media.
*Observe reduction in AHLconc as a result of the aiiA being produced by J37022
*'''Controls'''
**Un-modified DH5a
**Blank media
**No AHL (+ and - J37022 cells)

==Protocal==


===Evening of Day 1===

*Make up all tubes to 2ml in '''BIG''' tubes according to this table
*Culture (8ml) J37106 to test the AHL tomorrow
* Those + AHL should be made to a final concentration of 1 micromolar AHL
* Thos + IPTG should have 100ul of IPTG added

===Day 2===

*Make fresh Day culture of J37016, OD = 0.1, (25ml)
**Wait 2 hrs
*Pipette 1.5ml of each culture into labeled eppindorphs.
**Centrafuge down the cells for 3 min
*Pippette 1.5ml of J37016 cells into 15 labeled eppendorfs
**centrafuge down the cells for 3 min
*Disgard J37016 supernatent
*Transfer the supernatent from the test tubes into the now empty J37016 tubes
*Resuspend the j37016 cells in the test supernatents
*Incubate for four hours. in the 37{{c}} shaker
*Pippette the J27016 cells into a 96 well plate and mesure with flourmeter
