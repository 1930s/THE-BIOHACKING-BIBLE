==About the Requirement==

*To fulfill this requirement you must read the entire Biology Department Safety Plan.
*You do not need to memorize the information within this document, but you do need to read it and familiarize yourself enough with the contents so that you would be able to easily look up information if ever needed.
*Please make sure you complete the questionnaire found within the Safety Plan.  You do not need to turn the answers in (or even write them down, mental answers will suffice).
