Work to be Done:

1. DpnI digest, PCR cleanup and transform 30.bat2.30.thi3 muts

2. Digest the original 30.bat2.30.thi3s with XP and connect them to ES cut R0011 in AC backbone and 3K3 backbone '''-done'''

3. Also, transform the ligation said above (in both plasmids) with the BSGD devices using triple antibiotic plates  '''-done'''

4. Ligate and transform SAGD and WGD together '''-done'''

5. Check the two sequencing results '''-done, both good (kb), should LC w/substrate and smell to be extra sure tho'''

6. Maybe religate and transform ATF1 into yeast plasmid '''-done'''


I can come in for only a little bit on Sunday unfortunately.  Who else can come in?  It'd be great if we could do this all this weekend.
