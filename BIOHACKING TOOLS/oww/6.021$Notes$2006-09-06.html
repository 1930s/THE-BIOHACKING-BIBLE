==Administrative==
* Recitation @ noon cancelled
* MIT press has not printed enough textbooks
** Get copies from Janice 36-825 with ID
** Janice is only in on Tuesdays/Thursdays

==Notes==
* Engineering approach to studying basic physical processes that underlie how cells work
* Interdisciplinary
** Assumed pre-reqs: math, engineering, physics
** Not assumed: anatomy, physiology, biochemistry
* Cell membranes
** Focus of class
** Keeps stuff in and out and lets stuff in and out
** Like a castle: has walls but also gates
** Transport of water, ions, nutrients, waste, signals, building blocks, products
*Eukaryotes
** Environment is maintained by body
* Example: Digestive system
** Lots of skin folded up in small intestines
** All nutrients need to pass through skin
** More membrane -> more nutrient flow
** Epithelial cells in intestines are very tightly connected so nutrients have to flow through cells
** Example of coupling sodium transport with glucose
