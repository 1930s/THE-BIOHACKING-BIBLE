==Minipreps==

*Ran minipreps for J37022, J37020, J37018 and J37025
*The results were not promising -  a couple looked ok, but most of them had bands all over the place.
*Will re-do tomorrow

==Cre-Lox==

*Minipreps not totally conclusive, but we will continue as the chances are that they are correct, so they can now be transformed into a registry plasmid - pSB1A2
