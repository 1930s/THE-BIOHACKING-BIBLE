==totalRNA extraction from cells (in 6-well plate) with Trizol==

:1.  Remove medium and wash 2x with 5ml PBS. <br>
:2.  Remove all traces of PBS and lyse the cells by adding 0.5 ml Trizol. Pass several times through a pipet. <br>
:3.  Incubate homogenates for 10 min at RT. <br>
 it is possible to interrupt here and store the tubes at -80˚C
:4.  Add 100μl CHCL3 (Chloroform) per 0.5ml Trizol. Mix by shaking vigorously for 15" (by hand). <br>
:5.  Centrifuge samples at 12krpm, 4˚C for 15min. <br>
:6.  Transfer the colorless upper phase into a fresh tube and add 300μl iso-propanol. <br>
:7.  Mix well and incubate at RT for 15min. <br>
:8.  Spin at max speed, 4˚C for 15min. <br>
:9.  Remove supernatant and wash pellet once with 1ml 70% Ethanol. <br>
:10. Mix by vortexing and spin at max speed for 5min, 4˚C. <br>
:11. Remove supernatant and dry pellet (in speed-vac or 37˚C). <br>
:12. Resuspend pellet in 50μl H2O (RNAse free). <br>
:13. Run 1μl on >1.5% agarose gel and determine the OD at 260nm (dilute ~1:200 if not using the [[Nanodrop]]). <br>
