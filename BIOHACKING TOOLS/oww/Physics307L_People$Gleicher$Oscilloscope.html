1) The experiment we performed is detailed on this page [[Physics307L:Labs/Oscilloscope]].

2) The data I obtained is on my page [[Physics307L:People/Gleicher/Notebook/070827]].

3) The errors were measured by estimating the amount that the fall time would vary around a center 

value. Unfortunately I have not been able to plot this yet.
{{SJK comment|label=1|comment=[[User:Steven J. Koch|Steven J. Koch]] 00:50, 31 August 2007 (EDT):In your lab notebook, you have three measurements for the fall time.  You can use the mean of those as your estimate of the "true" value.  You can derive an estimate for the error in your measurment from the spread in those three measurements (we will talk about this in the next lecture).}}

4) In the process of performing the lab I learned more about the wiki format, and got a refresher on how to use a scope.

5) I didn't explore much outside the procedure but performed measurements several times to make sure my data was reasonable.

6) One word: Barcaloungers
* How come [http://barcalounger.com/index.php these people don't have their TV lined up straight]? Do barcaloungers do something to your eyesight?--[[User:Steven J. Koch|Steven J. Koch]] 00:47, 31 August 2007 (EDT)
