I am an associate professor at the University of Delaware.  See my [http://udel.edu/~schmidtc site]

While much of my laboratory focuses on the study of herpesviruses that cause lymphoma in chickens, a second area of interest is bioinformatics.   I was curious to see if '''Openwetware''' could serve as a collaboration site for life scientists to describe new bioinformatics applications and services that we anticipate would facilitate our work. In the past, I have found it very helpful to describe to computer scientists my ideas of how a particular application would work in a "perfect world".  Subsequently the computer scientists tell me what parts of that vision are attainable and the effort that would go into developing such an application.    Consequently I have started a [[Bioinformatics Discussion Group]] where I hope we can discuss the development of future bioinformatics applications.
