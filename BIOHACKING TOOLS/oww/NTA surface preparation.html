==Overview==

The purpose of this protocol is to provide a detailed method for the preparation of an NTA chip for the Biacore S51.  

==Materials==
*NTA Sensor chip with an un-used Flow Cell
*Reagent Rack 1
*Small Plastic vials (4) , type BR-1002-12
*10mM Glycine pH 2.2 (150ul)
*50mM NaOH (150ul)
*BiaNormalization Solution (200ul)
*52ug/ml MgCl2 (30 ul)


==Procedure==
#Put at least 150ul of 10mM Glycine pH 2.2 in to a small vial and place in the Biacore rack
#Put at least 150ul of 50mM NaOH into a small vial vial and place in the Biacore rack
#Create new or re-use a small vial of BiaNormalization Solution and place in into the rack at position F6
#Eject the rack currently in the Biacore and replace with the rack containing Glycine and NaOH.
#Start and interactive run with a PBS-P(0.005%) mobile phase
##Flow rate = 30
##Flow Cell = The new Flow Cell
##Spots = 1 & 2
#Enter the Glycine and NaOH  into the solutions table
#Mark the appropriate settings
##Prepare the flow system if necessary
##Normalize the detector
##Drag the samples to their appropriate locations
#Preform 3 alternating 1 minute injections (30 ul) of  Glycine and NaOH
#Check the NTA surface by starting another interactive run and inject 52ug/ml MgCl2 for 1 minute at a flow rate of 10 ul/min.
