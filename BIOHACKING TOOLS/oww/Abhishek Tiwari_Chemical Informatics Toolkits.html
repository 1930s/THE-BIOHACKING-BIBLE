"Any idiot can stand up and say that virtual screening doesn't work. It takes real brains to show how to improve it!" - Mark McGann

Currently a lot of toolkits (Daylight Toolkit, Chemaxon Toolkit, OpenEye Toolkit, MOE SVL, Accord, CDK, JOELib etc) are available from different vendors and organization. Most of them are equally good but choice may vary based on user prospective. I will try to give a summarized overview of some commonly used Chemical Informatics Toolkits. For academics user Chemaxon JChem (which is free for academic user) and Open Source Toolkits like CDK and JOELib will be a better choice. If your budget permits then you can use Daylight, Accord , OpenEye, MOE SVL or any other depending on your needs but Chemaxon and MOE are low budget high quality options.

JChem Base is a Java tool for the development of applications that allow for the search of mixed structural and non-structural data.JChem Base will integrate with a variety of database systems (Oracle, MS SQL Server, DB2, Access, etc) with web interfaces and offers fast substructure, similarity, exact and superstructure search engine using 2D hashed fingerprints. Structures are stored in database tables. Structural and non-structural data can be combined. SDF, SMILES, etc. can be imported and exported. JChem Base also supports ChemAxon's Chemical Terms language to enable complex chemical queries, expressions and rules. The system includes Marvin, a Java based chemical editor and viewer. Using the JChem Cartridge for Oracle the user can access many JChem functions such as structure storage and search, property prediction, structure canonicalization and Chemical Terms directly from Oracle's SQL.


'''Chemical Computing Group'''(''Free Evaluation License'')  http://www.chemcomp.com

Scientific Vector Language (SVL) is the built-in command language, scripting language and application development language of MOE(Molecular Operating Environment). SVL is a "chemistry aware" computer programming language with over 1,000 specific functions for analyzing and manipulating chemical structures and related molecular objects. SVL is a concise, high-level language and SVL programs are typically 10 times smaller that equivalent programs written in C or Fortran. SVL source code is compiled to a "byte code" representation, which is then interpreted by the base run-time environment making SVL programs inherently portable across different computer hardware and operating systems.


'''The Chemistry Development Kit'''(''Free & Open Source'')  http://cdk.sf.net/

The Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) is a Java library for structural chemo- and bioinformatics. It is now developed by more than 40 developers all over the world and used in more than 10 different academic as well as industrial projects world wide.In the past few years, the CDK library evolved into a fully blown chemoinformatics package with code reaching from QSAR descriptor calculations to 2D and 3D model building. Programs like the 2D structure editor JChemPaint and NMRShiftDB, a database of organic molecules and their NMR spectra are based on the Chemistry Development Kit (CDK).

Unfortunately this open source toolkit has a lot of problems and is still needed to improve. For developers it is a great opportunity to join hands with CDK team and bring new modules. Existing modules are not much reliable. For naive developer and academic users it is a good option to explore toolkit programming.


'''Daylight Chemical Information Systems'''(''Free Evaluation License'')      http://www.daylight.com/

Daylight is very first company which introduced concepts like SMILESTM, SMARTS® and it can be consider as Parent of Chemical Informatics Systems. Daylight provides cheminformatics toolkits, applications, and database systems that are infinitely customizable to accommodate the needs of a wide variety of specialized scientific applications. Daylight toolkits provide an object-oriented programming library used to deliver cheminformatics capabilities to in-house applications. Currently Daylight provide 2 toolkits

'''Digital Chemistry/Barnard Chemical Information (BCI)''' http://www.bci.gb.com

Digital Chemistry offers a rich set of components which allow users to develop custom applications exploiting a wide range of chemical informatics techniques.BCI toolkits provide support for Third Party Toolkits and Standards which makes it unique. Available toolkits from Digital Chemistry
*Markush Toolkit Components
*Clustering Toolkit Component
*Diversity Toolkit Component
*Fingerprint and Dictionary Generation Toolkit Component
*MOLSMART Toolkit Component

Individually, each Toolkit Component allows developers to quickly create applications in specific areas of chemical informatics such as clustering or fingerprint generation. However, the Components are also highly integrated with the output of each being freely interchangeable with others. For example, the Fingerprint Component can be used to generate structure fingerprints for sets of molecules, or the Markush Components to calculate physicochemical properties or fingerprints for the library members. These data may then be passed to the Clustering or Diversity Components for further analysis.

A number of language wrappers are available allowing the development of applications which may be subsequently deployed in any single, or multi-tiered architecture. Each language wrapper follows the same implementation pattern, making use of different languages as easy as possible. Currently Language support is available for: C/C++, Java, Visual Basic (6 and .NET), PERL and PYTHON.


'''JOELib2'''(''Free & Open Source'') http://www-ra.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/software/joelib/
