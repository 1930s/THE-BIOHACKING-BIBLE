===Gel Electrophoresis w/ 2% Gel===
1. Protocol
    - mixed 2 g Ultrapure agarose w/ 100 mL 1X TBE in plastic flask
    - heated for 1.5 min in microwave w/ top loosely screwed on
    - added 3 microL EtBr
    - poured into gel frame and let set for 20 min
    - placed into running box and submerged w/ TBE
    - wells loaded
    - ran gel @ 130 V, 45 min
2. Samples
    L. 1: 1 kB ladder
    L. 2 and 3: DNA nanostructure
    L. 4 and 5: neg control w/ no oligonucleotides
