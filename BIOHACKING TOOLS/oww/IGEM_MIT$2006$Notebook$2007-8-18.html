=Things to Do Today=

1. Fluorescent experiment setup:

* After 20 hours of growth, dilute 1:250 in 25-mL cultures in 250-mL flasks and shake for 4 hours at 220 RPM at 37C- DONE

* Take OD600s of those 25-mL cultures- DONE

*Dilute the cultures 1:25 in 25-mL culture in 250-mL flasks adjusting for OD600 and shake for 50 mins at 220 RPM at 37C- DONE

*Calculations: 

R0040.E0840- 0.42 OD600- 2.667 mL to 22.3 mL media

J45995- 1.02 OD600- 1.098 mL to 23.9 mL media

J45996- 1.12 OD600- 1 mL to 24 mL media

B0015- 0.48 OD600- 2.333 mL to 22.7 mL media

*Extract 200 uL from each culture three times and make triplicate cultures for each part- DONE

2. Obtain B-PER for GC lysis experiment- CONTACTED TOM AND AUSTIN, SAID TO ASK SAUER LAB, ASKED SAUER LAB (THEY HAVE IT BUT ONLY AS PERSONAL STOCK), EMAILED BIOSTUFF (NO RESPONSE)

3. Start a time course for J45120 and J45181 late at night- CAN"T DO WITHOUT LYSIS SOLUTION

4. Smell J45250 1AT3 culture with added precursor- DONE (SMELLS!)

5. Make LC out of a colony from streaked out J45250 1AT3 plate- DONE

6. Contact Lily about specifics of GC run tomorrow- DONE
