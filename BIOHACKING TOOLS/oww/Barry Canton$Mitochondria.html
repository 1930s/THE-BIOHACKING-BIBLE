==Nucleic acid import into mitochondria in vivo==
===DNA===
*Author - method - mitochondria type
*Souza et al. - DQAsomes, DNA-MLS conjugate - in vivo mammalian mitochondria
**DQAsomes release DNA near to mitochondria.
**MLS is conjugated to the dsDNA via a commercial "genegrip".
**Doesn't work if you use a liposome rather than a DQAsome.
*Khan et al. - PTD-MLS-TFAM-DNA conjugate - in vivo mammalian mitochondria
**Similar idea to Souza et al. but they use a PTD to get it into the cells.  Does the MLS not need to be on the end?  They use TFAM instead of "genegrip".
*Koulintchenko et al. - linear dsDNA - isolated plant mitochondria
*Vestweber et al. - 5' DNA crosslinking with signal sequence - isolated yeast mitochondria
*Seibel et al. - mid-sequence amino-modified deoxythimidine crosslinking with signal sequence - isolated rat liver mitochondria
*Yoon et al. - bacterial conjugation - isolated mouse mitochondria
*Koulintchenko et al. - natural competence - isolated mammalian mitochondria

===RNA===
*Yeast tRNA - protein complex - in vivo yeast mitochondria
*MRP complex - short RNA-protein complex - in vivo yeast, mammalian mitochondria
*Bhattacharyya et al. - tRNA-like aptamers - Leishmania, isolated mitochondria.
