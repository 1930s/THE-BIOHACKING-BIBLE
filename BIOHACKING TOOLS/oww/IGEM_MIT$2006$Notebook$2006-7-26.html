==Silent mutation to eliminate PstI site in pchA==
*Diluted pchA mutation primers to 25&mu;M
*did a PNK step on the primers (they're in little tubes in the freezer, if we want to re-do mutation without re-doing PNK)
*Used pchBA miniprep + primers & followed the stratagene site-directed mutagenesis protocol
*did a pcr cleanup after digesting old template dna with DpnI 

==Miniprep B0015==
Did 3 minipreps of the terminator for general use

==Digest R0040 and B0030(2)==
Digested R0040 with E,S and B0030 with E,X<br>
(We want to hook the promoter and RBS to each other)

==Digest B0030(2) and CDS+Terminator==
Cut B0030(2) with SP and CDS+Term with XP to hook up the two
*'''will cut B0030(2) tomorrow b/c ran out of miniprep'''

==Digest ATF1 for hooking up to B0030(2)==
ATF1 cut with EX, cut again with P to hook up to to SP cut B0030(2)

==Cut B0015 with EX==
Will hook up later

==Cut backbone with EP==
EP backbone for inserting the SPP

==LIGATIONS==
#promoter R0040 + rbs B0030
#promoter R0040 + rbs B0032
#stationary phase promoter osmY + backbone pSB1A3-1

==Transformations==
#ROO40+B0030(amp backbone) on '''AMP''' plate
#ROO40+BOO32(amp backbone) on '''AMP''' plate
#osmY promoter + pSB1A3-1 on '''AMP''' plate

==Liquid Cultures==
End of the day liquid cultures for future use: ATF1, R0040, B0030(2)
