5 plates in fridge across cyano freezer, kaib pelleted in freezer

for the pcr's, 1 gel on summer cyano table.  use this instead of e-gel (1% agarose, 15 lanes).

''to do: wed'' 

:*find out which stand is j36011.  
:**may I have your attention please? may I have your attention please? will the real j36011 please stand up?  i repeat, will the real j36011 please stand up?  we're gonna have a problem here..
:*inoculate real j36011 

''to do: thurs''
midi of fo' real j36011, kaib (~3.5 h)
sequencing be4 4


==results of electroporation==
As exptected; no growth on term or J36012, most likely because of ARC error. Next time diluting the ligation mixture and only using 1uL.

==checking for kaiB==

Checking Nick's original plate to see indeed if any of them match his notebook entry or resemble KaiB.

==col pcr from nick's plates results==

Nothing matches =(

==verification of what we have==

Using AlignX and Vector NTI, verified nucleotide for nucleotide that we indeed have J36000 and J36002, beyond a doubt.
