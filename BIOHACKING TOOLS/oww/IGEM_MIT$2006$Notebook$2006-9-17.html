===To do===
*make a/c LCs of transformants from yesterday (6 plates)
*transform mutagenesis (going to have to be creative like i was today: either get new cells from Knight Lab or dig in the temporary freezer upstairs for our box)
*pull out LCs of any good J45014-yeast assemblies from 37 room. make glycerols --(can hopefully miniprep if time)

==Results==
*No transformants J45120-J45320 (1) 
*No transformants J45120-J45320 (2) 
*No transformants osQ-J45119-J45320 (1)
*No transformants osQ-J45119-J45320 (2)
*No transformants omsY-J45219
