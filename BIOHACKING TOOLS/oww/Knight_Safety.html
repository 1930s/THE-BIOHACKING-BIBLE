==Information and training==

See Heather's very complete explanation of all the [[Endy:Safety_Training | safety training]] you need to do.  The only adjustments for the Knight lab are that you should read the CSAIL chemical hygiene plan (not the Biology one) and you should do the Knight lab specific chemical training.  Both of these are linked below.

===General safety resources===

Much of the labs safety references including MSDS's (Material Safety Data Sheets) are kept on the short bookshelves in the hallway between [http://www.csail.mit.edu/resources/maps/3/311.gif 32-311] and [http://www.csail.mit.edu/resources/maps/3/321.gif 32-321].

Heather has written up a lot of useful safety information [[Endy:Safety | here]].

EHS course materials can be found at http://web.mit.edu/environment/training/materials.html

===CSAIL emergency preparedness plan===

[http://www.csail.mit.edu/resources/emergency/ Emergency Preparedness Materials]
*includes floor evacuation maps and an explanation of the Stata Alarm system

===CSAIL chemical hygiene plan===

Everyone in the lab has to read through the CSAIL Chemical Hygiene Plan.  It is linked below and also available as a paper copy on the shelves in the hallway between [http://www.csail.mit.edu/resources/maps/3/311.gif 32-311] and [http://www.csail.mit.edu/resources/maps/3/321.gif 32-321]. To make changes to the document, contact [[User:Austin|Austin Che]] or edit the [[Knight:Chemical Hygiene Plan|source]].

'''[http://openwetware.org/index.php?title=Knight:Chemical_Hygiene_Plan&action=latexdoc&ext=pdf CSAIL Chemical Hygiene Plan]  <--Read and familiarize yourself with this.''' <br> (Template from Barry Mendes, EHS,  x3-1665.  Modified and extended by Austin.)

Once you've read this document, print and sign the [[Media:MITKnightCHPRoster.pdf|compliance form]].  Give this to Reshma to be sent via campus mail to the EHS lead contact Carolyn Stahl.

===Lab chemical training===

If you've never had lab specific chemical training before, have Tom or [[Reshma Shetty | Reshma]] take you through it.  For renewal training (done on a yearly basis), you can just read through the lab specific chemical training linked below.  It is also available as a paper copy on the bulletin board outside  [http://www.csail.mit.edu/resources/maps/3/306.gif 32-306] and on the shelves in the hallway between [http://www.csail.mit.edu/resources/maps/3/311.gif 32-311] and [http://www.csail.mit.edu/resources/maps/3/321.gif 32-321].  If you have any questions or want to suggest modifications, talk to Reshma.

'''[[Knight:Lab chemical training | Lab specific chemical training]] <--Read and familiarize yourself with this.''' <br> (Template from Kathleen Gilbert, EHS,  x3-8409.  Modified and extended by Reshma.)

Once you've completed this training, print and sign the [[Media:MITKnightLSCHRoster.pdf|compliance form]].  Give this to Reshma to be sent via campus mail to the EHS lead contact Carolyn Stahl.

==Procedures==

MIT's standard operating procedures on a variety of topics can be found at the [http://web.mit.edu/environment/ehs/topic/sops.html EHS SOPs, SOG, Fact Sheets, Programs, etc.] site.

===Safety checks===
*[[Knight:Biohazardous waste | Autoclave validation]]
*[[Knight:Level I checklist | Level I checklist]]
*[[Knight:Level II inspection | Level II inspection]]

===Waste disposal===

===Chemical storage===

====Acetic acid and other organic acids====
From Kathleen Gilbert, EHS,  x3-8409

Acetic acid is tricky because it is an organic acid that is ignitable and it is more compatible with other organic flammables than with inorganic acids.  Acetic acid can be stored with the flammables in a flammable cabinet without a secondary container.  If Acetic acid is stored with inorganic acids, it should be in a separate secondary container since it is incompatible with inorganic acids.  Trifluoracetic acid is also an organic acid so the same rules apply as with acetic acid.  

You do not need the acids stored in a closed [secondary] container.  A gray bin is fine.
