Average = 11.5 -> 115,000 cells/ml<br>
Diluted by 1:100 -> 1,150 cells/ml<br>
Plated 3 ml/well -> 3,450 cells/well
===General Formula===
<math>
\mbox{Expected Cells} = \mbox{Number Plated} * \mbox{Plating Efficiency} * 2^{\frac{\mbox{Time Since Plating} - \mbox{Seating Time}}{\mbox{Doubling Time}}}
</math><br>
===My plates===
*Number plated = 3,450 cells/well
*Plating efficiency = .25
*Time since plating = 48 hr
*Seating time = 24 hr
*Doubling time = 24 hr
*Expected cells = <math>
3450\ \frac{cells}{well} * .25 * 2^{\frac{48\ hr - 24\ hr}{24\ hr}} = 1725\ \frac{cells}{well}

Although this mutation doesn't look like much, it is enough to destabilize the fluorophore and make the protein fluoresce yellow instead of green.
