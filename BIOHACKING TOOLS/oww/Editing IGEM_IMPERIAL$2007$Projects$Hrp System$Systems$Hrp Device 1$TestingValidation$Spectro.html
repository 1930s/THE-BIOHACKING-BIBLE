*Add 4ml of the M9 Amp medium to a curvete using a 5ml pipette.
*Use this as the blank to zero the O.D.600
**<font color=green> This is to calibrate any absorbance from the medium </font>
*Then remove 4ml of our culture and read the O.D.600. Measurement should be carried out quickly to avoid the cells sinking to the bottom of the tube and giving an inaccurate O.D.600
*Return the 4ml to the culture.
