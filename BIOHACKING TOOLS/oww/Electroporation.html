==Specific Protocols==
*[[Knight:Electroporation]]
*[[Endy:High-efficiency electroporation]]

==Notes==
*If you are in a hurry and your selection marker is ampicillin, you can go ahead and plate immediately because ampicillin takes a while to be pumped into cells at a high enough concentration to have an effect.
*The [[Endy Lab]] is trying to use a standard positive control to better compare (and hopefully improve) the transformation efficiencies in the lab, you can check it out [[Endy:Standard transformation positive control|here]].
