==Biobrick Primers==

*E0240:
**F_New (incl E0240, Spe1): CTTAGTAG.ACTAGT.TCACACAGGAAAGTACTAGATGCG (53.1)
**R Same as before (incl 3K3/1AK3, EcoRI): TCAGCGAT.GAATTC.CAGAAATCATCCTTAGCGAAAGC (54.2) 


* I2057:
**F (incl I2057, Spe1): CTTAGTAG.ACTAGT.TCACACAGGAAAGTACTAGATGGC (52.1)
**R: same as E0240

T9002 E0240 piece
*E0240-F     8mer spe1 TCACACAGGAAAGTACTAGATGCG 53.1
*Same as E0240_BB_F


==PCR/Gel==
*Ran a gel of E0240-3K3 BB PCR and E0240_T9002 tails PCR  - nothing showed up
*Made a Colony PCR of the 1 colony of F2620-3K3
**Ran a gel of it and looks good - minipreped for sequencing
*PCR'ed another 100ul E0240_T9002 tails PCR at 51 with vent and a 1:30 ext time


==Sequencing==
*Got some of the redone sequencing from monday
*E0240-3K3 looks scarred on both sides
*I2055-3K3 is scared but has a random 1 base insertion towards the end
*I2055-1AK3 still has no promoter
*Minipreped I2055-3K3 (that we're pretty sure contains the promoter) for seq
*Shouldn't put too much faith in these b/c these results still aren't the ones we made glycerols of
