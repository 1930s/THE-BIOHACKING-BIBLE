===Purification of LuxR-His===
*The SDS-PAGE gel of the soluble protein fraction was checked in the morning. The gel showed bands at 28kDa, the size of LuxR-His, in the soluble fraction and the insolble fraction. In addition, from the soluble fraction that was run through the column it can be seen that there is also this band present in some of the fractions. From these results we decided to try to purifiy a large amount of the LuxR-His from the soluble fraction of 1 litre cells.
