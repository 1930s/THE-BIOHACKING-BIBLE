==Heavy Metal Binding Proteins/Peptides==


There are several classes of metal binding proteins to consider.  (for review, see Cobbett02, below) 

First, those that bind to many metal types (Cd, Hg, Pb, Cu, Zn, etc).  These are nice in that they are multifunctional, but the disadvantage is that they will also bind non-toxic ions like Zn, thus decreasing their efficiency.

**Metallothioneins (MT's) -- small animal proteins which contain many cysteine motifs (usually CxxC) 
**Phytochelatins (PC's) -- plant peptides of the form (EC)n-G where n=# repeats (usually 2-10, but can be as many as 20) (see the Bae papers)

Also, certain artificially selected sequences bind selectively to certain metals.  
**The MT-like motif CCAA was found to highly selective for Hg, while CAAC had broad specificity (see DeSilva02)
**The motif (CGCCG)3 was found to bind both cadmium and mercury (see Pazirandeh98)

Seems that Mejare01 does a nice job of comparing the different Cd-binding methods which have been tried.  According to them, the methods which gave the biggest increase (>60-fold) in binding capacity were those that expressed entire MT proteins (or domains of them).  '''However, they did not consider the papers where PCs were used, which seem to have much higher binding capacities.''' 

The Bae papers seem to indicate that the EC20 motif can bind both Cd and Hg (higher affinity for Hg), and the absolute accumulation is higher than for the MT-derived peptides.  Also, EC20 binding still works in the presence of up to 200mM salt and even EDTA.  Might be a good idea to ask them for their Lpp-OmpA-EC20 expression construct!  


'''Binding Sequences To Try'''
*The full Pazirandeh98 Hg/Cd-specific binding sequence (CGCCG) is:  CGCCGKGHCGCCGKGHCGCCG
*For good non-specific binding, best bet seems to be the PC-derived EC20 sequence: (EC)20-Gly

*From DeSilva02, the MerP-derived Hg-specific binding sequence (GMTCCAA) could be repeated 3x:  GMTCCAAGMTCCAAGMTCCAA
*For Cd-specific binding, could later use the CadA-derived sequence (GFTCANC)

==Cadmium==
===Summary===
*Cd causes damage to cells primarily by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which causes single-strand DNA damage and disrupts the synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins. Cd is also an inhibitor of the DNA mismatch repair systemâ€¦Results of this study confirmed that Cd toxicity caused profound changes in gene expression in which several stress response systems were induced simultaneously.
*known carcinogen
