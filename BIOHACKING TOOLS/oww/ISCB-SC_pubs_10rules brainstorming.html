== Before the Conference ==

* '''Choose an appealing theme/topic'''
** general scientific topic but focus on a particular question that students are interested in eg. academia vs. science, future of the field, etc. or pick a particular scientific topic that is just emerging (see BioSysBio)
** regular annual conference typically run by large societies???
** make decision whether you want a general conference or an event that focusses on a particular topic - make sure you have a sufficiently wide range of topics in the former case

* '''Choose the right date and location'''
** either long before or after other major conferences in the field or as part of a major conference
** teaming up with a larger event will save the delegates a lot of money
** Locations should be easy accessible (train and plane, also local public transport)
** budget accommodation should be within reasonable distance.
** choose a place where attendees can make of it a holiday


* '''Create a balanced timetable'''
** Allow a significant proportion of the timetable to submitted, reviewed and accepted material
** Give ample time for socialising during the conference
*** allows people to meet their peers
*** colloborations
** confirm keynote speakers very early
*** they are busy so the book out quickly
*** having the names of keynote speakers helps to promote the event
** mix top senior scientists in the field and young PIs
** find a good mix and people that are committed to the student community
** Young PIs can give good insight into what it takes to get faculty or postdoc positions
** Top senior scientists usually have a great overview of the field and can comment on developments that are to be expected in the future and how current topics fit into the bigger picture
** big names makes your conference more attractive
** Surveys of your target audience can tell you what are the most suitable speakers
** Panel discussions where keynotes show they personal side are most inspiring to young researchers
** include social activities and time for networking

* '''Select carefully your key helpers: the organising committee'''
** Wide set of skills required
*** website and printed materials
*** reviewers from a wide range of areas
*** finances and fundraising
*** organization
*** marketing
*** evaluation
*** managing/organisational skills
*** local organization
** should be large enough to handle all aspects but not too large
** try to avoid having free loaders on your committees
** involve local organizations by inviting a speaker from the local community
** involve local organizations by inviting representatives from local companies (you might want to offer one spot for an industry talk as a means to raise money)
** will help to give easier access to venues, local organizing team/volunteers, etc
** Sponsors from the local area might be easier to target
** local organizations could take over administrative tasks (registration, find accommodation)
** give credit where credit is due: recognize contributions by sponsors, speakers, OC, PC, etc.

* '''Allow plenty of planning time'''
** 9 months to a year because:
*** Submission deadlines need to be considered
*** production deadlines as well
*** confirming invited speakers and other aspects of the agenda
*** spreading the word (ie. marketing)
*** fundraising
** give enough time for people to get their visas and book their travel in advance for cheaper fares and accommodation
** get better rates on venues


* '''Study all potential financial issues affecting the event'''
** approach sponsors early
** make clear how they will benefit
** find best matching spnsors to your audience
** even of this timee your approached sponsor does not support your event, keep the contact for the future
** make an estimate of you cost for conference venue, meals, 
** make an estimate of how many people you expect
** set registration fee appropriately
** fellowships for people who could otherwise not come
** awards for outstanding contributions
** allow publication of abstracts in a journal, etc.

== During the Conference ==

* '''Meet everyone from the OC the day before the event'''
** inspect the facilities
** discuss responsibilities if you haven't done so before
*** contact point
*** registration (this needs to happen earlier i guess)
*** speaker liaison

* '''Have contact information for all relevant 3rd party people'''

*** caterers
*** building manager
*** main conference organizer if you are having your event as part of another conference

== After the Conference ==

* '''Wrap-up all information aspects that may have a lasting impact in your community'''
** particularly important if you are planning to have a similar event in the future
** make evaluation publicly accessible
** submit abstracts to journal
** upload photos of the event to the website (videos too, if you have any!)
** post names of winners of awards and travel fellowships on the website'
** make an evaluation to improve the focus (if desired) of the conference
** identify issues that you were not aware of - i.e. what people didn't like

* '''Send one last email'''
** to all delegates informing them about the things that have happened since the conference
** include announcements for the next event if you are planning one
