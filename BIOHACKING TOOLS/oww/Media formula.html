==TAP (Tris-Acetate Phosphate)==
To make one liter of TAP:

*10 mL 2M Tris-acetate (pH 7.0)
*10 mL Phosphate buffer (pH 7.0)
*10 mL nutrient stock
*10 mL trace metals (10x dilution)
*Bring to 1 liter with distilled water
===Variations===
*For plates add 15g agar per liter (1.5%)
*For TAP-sulfur substitute MgCl<sub>2</sub> for the MgSO<sub>4</sub> in the nutrient stock and omit trace metals
==Materials==
===2M Tris-acetate stock===
*242 g Tris base
*Dissolve in 600 mL water while titrating to pH 7.0 with glacial acetic acid.
*Bring to 1 liter
===Phosphate buffer===
*10.8 g K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>
*5.6 g KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>
*Bring to 1 liter
===Nutrient stock===
*40 g NH<sub>4</sub>Cl 
*10 g MgSO<sub>4</sub>·7H<sub>2</sub>O
*5 g CaCl<sub>2</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O
*Bring to 1 liter
===Trace metals===
Making this is a complex proceedure so (unless you think you will be using a lot of it) there are a couple of alternatives.
*Make a soil extract by shaking a few grams of soil in water
*Use a small amount of Job's plant food spike
*Use tap water rather than distilled.

This makes a liter of full-strength, enough for 1000 L of TAP. Dilute an aliquot tenfold and use the diluted stock in making TAP

#Dissolve 50g of acid free EDTA in 250 ml of ddH<sub>2</sub>O. Heat to dissolve.
#Dissolve the following, one by one, in order, heating to approximately 100° in 550 ml ddH<sub>2</sub>O.
#*11.40 g BO<sub>3</sub>H<sub>3</sub>
#*22.00 g ZnSO<sub>4</sub>·7H<sub>2</sub>O
#*5.06 g MnCl<sub>2</sub>·4H<sub>2</sub>O
#*4.99 g FeSO<sub>4</sub>·7H<sub>2</sub>O
#*1.61 g CoCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O
#*1.57 g CuSO<sub>4</sub>·5H<sub>2</sub>O
#*1.1 g Mo<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub>(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>·4H<sub>2</sub>O (Ammonium Molybdate)
#Mix the two solutions (1 & 2) together. The resulting solution should be blue-green.
#Heat to 100°C. Cool slightly, but don't let the temperature drop below 80°-90°.
#Adjust pH to 6.5 to 6.8 with 20% KOH (approximately 83 ml). Don't let the temperature drop below 70° until after the pH is adjusted.
#Make up to 1L and let stand in a 2L Erlenmeyer flask, stoppered loosly. The color should change from green to purple over a period of days.
#Remove the rust-coloured precipitate by filtering, with suction, through 3 layers of Whatman #1 filter paper in a Buchner funnel. Repeat until no more precipitate is seen on the filter paper
#Store in a brown bottle at 4°.
