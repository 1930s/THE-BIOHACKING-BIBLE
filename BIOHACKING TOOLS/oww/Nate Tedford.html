BPEC: Non-viral gene delivery studies in primary liver cells and tissue-engineered liver bioreactors. Quantitative studies of vector/plasmid trafficking and expression of gene payload for the development of a mathematical model describing gene delivery in a three-dimensional tissue construct. Further analysis and optimization of model parameters could provide insight for increased non-viral transfection efficiency and development of novel polymer carriers.
