REPETITIVE STRUCTURES.

 Repeats are indicated for two alphabets: the 20-letter amino  acid  alpha-
 bet,  and  a  reduced  11-letter  alphabet in which the major hydrophobics
 LVIF, the charged residues KR and ED, the small residues AG, the  hydroxyl
 group  residues  ST,  the amid group residues NQ, and the aromatics YW are
 treated as combined letters.  For each alphabet, three classes of  repeats
 are  distinguished: separated repeats, simple tandem repeats, and periodic
 repeats. The separated  repeats  are  largely  non-overlapping.  They  are
 displayed  in  groups  of  matching  blocks  (exceeding a given core block
 length of contiguous  exact  matches)  and  intervening  spacer  distances
 (which  may  be  negative,  signifying  a partial overlap). The core block
 length in case of the amino acid alphabet is set to 4 for sequences up  to
 500  residues,  to 5 for sequences between 500 and 2000 residues, and to 6
 for longer sequences (same values increased by 4 for  the  reduced  alpha-
 bet).   Simple  tandem  repeats  are  displayed  in  similar  layout,  but
 separately. Sequence segments that are highly repetitive  with  relatively
 short repeats are displayed as periodic repeats.

MULTIPLETS.

 Multiplets refer to homooligopeptides of any length (e.g., A2, Q7,  etc.);
 altplets  refer  to  reiterations  of  two  different  residues (e.g., RG,
 EAEAEA, etc.). The  multiplet  composition  of  the  protein  sequence  is
 evaluated  for  both the amino acid and the charge alphabet. (High) Aggre-
 gate altplet counts are evalued only for the charge alphabet.  The  multi-
 plet  sequence  is  displayed  whenever  the  total multiplet count of the
 sequence falls outside the expected range (i.e., beyond 3 standard  devia-
 tions of the mean). Printed are also the histogram of the spacings between
 consecutive multiplets (differences between starting positions) as well as
 clusters  of multiplets (multiplet clusters are determined in the same way
 as charge clusters are determined; the  binomial  test  is  applied  to  a
 compressed sequence over the alphabet {M,S}, where M signifies a multiplet
 and S signifies a singlet; i.e., the amino acid sequence AADFFFGHRRT... is
 translated  as MSMSSMS..., and the binomial cluster test is applied to the
 latter sequence). Multiplets and altplets of specific residue content that
 individually show an unusually high count are indicated, and the positions
 of all multiplets exceeding a minimum length of 5 residues are shown.

PERIODICITY ANALYSIS.

 The program identifies periodic elements of periods between 1 and  10  for
 the amino acid alphabet, for the charge alphabet, and for a hydrophobicity
 alphabet. Each periodic element consists of an error-free core pattern (of
 length  at least 4 for the amino acid alphabet, 5 for the charge alphabet,
 and 6 for the hydrophobicity alphabet)  which  is  extended  allowing  for
 errors.   The  numbers  of  errors are given for each position in the con-
 sensus of a periodic pattern involving more than one letter. The displayed
 periodic patterns would generally not be statistically significant but are
 listed for the sake of a general interactive appraisal  of  the  sequence.
 Periodicities  of  exceptionally  high copy number are indicated with a !-
 mark.

SPACING ANALYSIS.

 The spacings between consecutive residues of the same type (all  20  amino
 acids,  +  and - charge, and combined charge *) are evaluated for signifi-
 cantly large or small maximal and minimal spacings. The output is  ordered
 by  the beginning point of the significant spacing. Entries are identified
 by the residue type, spacing (number of amino acids between the identified
 positions),  rank  of  the  displayed  spacing  (e.g.,  50 alanines in the
 sequence induce 51 spacings, ranked by decreasing length from  1  to  51),
 and  p-value  (probability  of exceeding the displayed spacing). A maximal
 spacing with p-value 0.01 or less is  considered  significantly  large;  a
 maximal  spacing  with  p-value 0.99 or larger is considered significantly
 small. Similarly, a minimal spacing with p-value 0.99 or  larger  is  con-
 sidered  significantly  small,  and a minimal spacing with p-value 0.01 or
 less is considered significantly large (excluding doublets). If the  first
 maximal  spacing  (rank  1)  of a residue is significantly large or small,
 then also the second maximal spacing (rank 2) is evaluated. Large  maximal
 and small minimal spacings indicate clustering effects, whereas small max-
 imal and large minimal spacings indicate excessive evenness in the distri-
 bution of the residues.
