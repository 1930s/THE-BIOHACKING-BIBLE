This is the list of the most important articles of this wiki. If you create an article in this wiki, just insert a link on this page. Not all articles need to be listed here, just do what feels right. There is also a space for  wanted articles. Also, see [[Special:Categories]] for all the categories which are used to tag articles, and [[Special:Allpages]] for all the pages.

== Wikiforum: open questions and wanted articles ==

Ask questions and build solutions collaboratively at [[wikiforum|our wikiforum]]. It is like a forum where threads would eventually evolve into clean tutorials: anyone can '''ask questions about bioinformatics'''. Just create a page where your specific question is asked. Once satisfying answers are given, the page can be moved to the list of articles above. 

Tip: you can get an email notification when a question is being answered, but you have to register:
# ''[[Special:Userlogin | create an account or log in]]'',
# ''confirm your email address'' in your ''[[Special:Preferences |preferences]]'',
# ''watch'' the pages that interest you.
