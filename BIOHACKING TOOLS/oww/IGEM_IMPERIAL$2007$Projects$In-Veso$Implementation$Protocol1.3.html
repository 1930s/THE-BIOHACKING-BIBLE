==1.3 Protocol for Adding Cell Extract into Vesicles==

===Day 1===
====Equipment====
* Glass vial x1
* Gilsson pipette (200µl) + pipette tips
* Nitrogen tap
* 1000µl pipette tip
* Desiccator connected to a vacuum
* 25ml Glass pipette x1
* Sonicator with medium-sized probe
* 25°C incubator

====Reagents====
* 10ml of dodecane
and
* 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) 20mg/ml in chloroform, ≥99.0%
or
* 1-Palmitoyl,2-oleoyl-sn-Glycero 3-phosphocholine (POPC) 20mg/ml in chloroform, ≥99.0%



'''Preparing the lipid-oil suspension for the inner leaflet'''
# Place 25 µl of the 20 mg/ml DOPC or POPC solution in a glass vial. '''(Equipment should generally be made of glass and not plastic so as to prevent adsorption of lipid molecules to plastic surface)'''
# Using plastic tubing and a 1ml pipette tip, evaporate the chloroform under nitrogen to obtain a dry, thin lipid film. '''(Rubber tubes are not recommended as they are more likely to emit debris into the lipid film)'''
# Put the vial in a desiccator connected to a vacuum for 1hr. '''(This is to remove the chloroform)'''
# Add 10 ml of dodecane to reach a final lipid concentration of 0.05 mg/ml.
# Place the vial containing the suspension in the ice bath.
# Sonicate suspension for 30 min (Pulse 1, ~10 Amp). '''(This is to disperse the phospholipids)'''
# Leave overnight at 25°C to ensure that the lipid molecules are fully dispersed in dodecane.

===Day 2===
====Equipment====
* Small tubes
* Aluminium foil
* 20µl pipette + tips
* 200µl pipette + tips
* 1000µl pipette + tips
* Tabletop centrifuge
* Vortex machine
* Syringe + stainless steel needle
* Glass slide + cover slip
* Optical microscope with phase contrast
* Fluorescent microscope

====Reagents====
* Commercial S30 E.coli extract
** E.coli complete amino acid mixture
** S30 premix without amino acid
** S30 extract circular
** Nuclease-free water 
* Plasmid DNA wtih pTet-GFP construct


'''Preparation of Reaction'''
# Add 5µl of E.coli complete amino acid mixture into a tube.
# Then add 20µl of S30 premix without amino acid.
# Next add 15µl of S30 extract circular.
# Add an appropriate volume of plasmid DNA depending on DNA concentration. '''(How many DNA molecules are needed in this step?)'''
# Finally add nuclease-free water to bring final volume to 100µl.


'''Formation of mono-layer vesicles'''
# Add 1µl of reaction into another tube containing 200μl of lipid-oil suspension.
# Vortex gently for a few seconds. '''(This is to break up the small aqueous droplet to form an extract-oil emulsion)'''
# Leave to stand for a few minutes. '''(Microdroplets will be stabilized by a monolayer of phospholipids at the oil–extract interface)'''


'''Formation of bi-layer vesicles'''
# Place 50μl of the extract-oil emulsion on top of 25μl S30 premix with amino acids.
# Leave to stand for a few minutes. '''(A monolayer of phospholipids will form at the interface of the biphasic solution)'''
# Centrifuge at 120 x g for 10 min.
''(Note: Alternatively, centrifuge at 30 x g for 20 min)''


'''Collecting the vesicles:'''
# Using a syringe with a stainless steel needle, collect some of the S30 premix.
# Expel some of the premix to remove all air from the syringe and needle. '''(Expelling most of the S30 premix would ensure a less diluted solution of vesicles)'''
# With the tip of the needle in the aqueous phase, gently expel the premix contained in the syringe. '''(This prevents the extraction of the lipid-oil suspension when the needle is plunged into the tube)'''
# Gently recirculate the solution several times.
# Aspirate most of the solution into the syringe, and remove the needle from the solution. '''(Be careful not to aspirate the lipid-oil suspension)'''
# Wipe the tip of the needle clean.
# Unload the vesicle suspension into a tube and store in the dark.
# Use optical microscopy to check that the vesicles obtained were not deformed or aggregated.
Ideally, the protocol should yield a few hundreds of vesicles and aggregates of 1 to a few tens of micrometers diameter. '''(Caution: Over-exposure of light under the microscope would bleach the GFP!!)'''

===Notes===
* Time required for Day 1: ~ 2h; for Day 2: ~2h.
* The protocol is based on [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=15591347 A vesicle bioreactor as a step toward an artificial cell assembly] by Vincent Noireaux and Albert Libchaber.
*Modifications to protocol:
** The original protocol uses mineral oil instead of dodecane
** The original protocol uses egg lecithin instead of DOPC or POPC
** The original protocol does not use Span 80
