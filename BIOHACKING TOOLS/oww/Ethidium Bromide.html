'''Ethidium Bromide''', often abbreviated EtBr

*Intercalating agent that inserts itself between DNA base pairs
*Fluorescent under UV light

'''Caution: Carcinogen/Mutagen'''

'''Handle with Nitrile gloves'''

===Hazards and Precautions===

Ethidium Bromide (EB) is commonly used as a non-radioactive marker for identifying  and visualizing nucleic acid bands in electrophoresis and in other methods of  gel-based nucleic acid separation. EB is a dark red, crystalline, non-volatile  solid, moderately soluble in water, which fluoresces readily with a reddish-brown  color when exposed to ultraviolet light (UV). Its formula is 2,7,-Diamino-10-ethyl-9-phenyl-phenanthridium  bromide, CAS# 1239-45-8. Although it is an effective tool, its hazardous properties  require special safe handling and disposal procedures. 

====Hazards==== 

EB is a '''potent mutagen''' and moderately toxic after an acute exposure. EB  can be absorbed through skin, so it is important to avoid any direct contact with  the chemical. EB is also an irritant to the skin, eyes, mouth, and upper respiratory  tract. It should be stored away from strong oxidizing agents in a cool, dry place,  and the container must be kept undamaged and tightly closed. 

====Safety Precautions====

People using EB should follow several safety procedures. The laboratory's Chemical  Hygiene Plan should reference this Fact Sheet, which outlines safe handling of  EB and proper cleanup procedures. EB users should receive documented safety training  on its hazards. EB must appear on the laboratory's chemical inventory, with accurate  estimates of on-hand and yearly use quantities. Pure EB should only be handled  in a fume hood, with the user wearing protective equipment that includes a lab  coat, closed-toe shoes, chemically resistant gloves, and chemical safety goggles  (not just safety glasses). 

Nitrile is an effective barrier to short-term exposure to EB. Gloves, such as  Best Manufacturing's N-DEXÂ® or others made of 100% nitrile, are available  from most laboratory supply distributors. EB users should wash their hands after  removing their gloves, even if they are certain the gloves weren't punctured. 

An emergency eyewash and shower should be accessible nearby. Like all other toxics,  EB should be used in a specially designated area where no eating or drinking is  allowed. When using ultraviolet light to visualize EB, the user must wear UV-blocking  eyewear or work in a UV cabinet with shielding glass in place.
