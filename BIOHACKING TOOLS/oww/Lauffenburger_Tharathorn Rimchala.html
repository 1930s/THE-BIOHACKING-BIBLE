Research Summary:

'''Connectivity Analysis of Chemotactic Responses in Invasive Cancer in 3D'''

* Carcinoma cells in metastatic tumors are polarized toward and are attracted to nearby blood vessels or lymphatics by chemoattractants ([http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/64/19/7022 Wyckoff et al], 2004; [http://www.nature.com/ni/journal/v6/n9/abs/ni1238.html Dabes et al], 2005).  This chemotactic response is essential  for tumor cell intravasation and determines their metastatic capability. In breast adenocarcinoma, the cancer cells are attracted toward blood vessel by epidermal growth factor (EGF) released by macrophages in local blood vessels.

* The goal of my work is to establish a functional connectivity map of signaling proteins involved in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and regulators of actin organization in EGF-induced actin-based migration.
