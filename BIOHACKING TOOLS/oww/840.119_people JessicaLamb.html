My name is Jessica Lamb, and I am a senior social work major; I am getting a minor in biology. The reason I wanted to take this class is that when taking genetics last semester, I found myself very interested in biotechnology, especially the ways it can and has been used to help people. I'm most interested in gene therapy.
