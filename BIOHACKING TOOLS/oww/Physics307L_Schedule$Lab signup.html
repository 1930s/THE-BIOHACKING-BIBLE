==Guidelines==
We are likely to run into unforeseen difficulties and conflicting needs of students.  Please be courteous and we'll try to work things out.  In general, sign up below when you know what experiment you want to do.  It probably doesn't make sense to sign up more than one week ahead of time.  Try to work things out with other students face to face during class.

|e/m Ratio for Electrons (dark)
|Set up for this lab is extensive (3 total power supplies) & there is high risk of damaging apparatus
|
|--
|Electron Diffraction (very dark, and works marginally)

|--
|Mass of the Electron (MCA)
|Apparently we cannot do this lab because the instructor (Koch) hasn't had radiation safety training.
|
|--
|Speed of Light (MCA)
|
|
|--
|Oil drop experiment (charge of electron)
|This one looks fun, but wasn't offered in 2006 (why?)

|Other new experiments?
|If you know of one, we may be able to make a purchase or you could take on a project of setting it up
