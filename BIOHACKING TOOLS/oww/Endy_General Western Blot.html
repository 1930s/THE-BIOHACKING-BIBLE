==Transfer and Incubations==
*After running gel, cut away stacking gel, cut a corner to mark orientation, and soak in transfer buffer for 45 minutes.
*Cut PVDF and 3mm Whatman blotting paper to correct size.
*Cut corner on PVDF and wet with methanol, then soak 5 minutes in H20, followed by 10 minutes in transfer buffer.  Wet 4 pieces of blotting paper in transfer buffer.
*Set up transfer bottom to top: 2 pieces blotting paper, gel, PVDF, two pieces blotting paper.  Be sure to preserve orientation of blot and avoid bubbles.
*Transfer 2 mA/cm^2 until transfer is complete (i.e. rainbow marker is fully transferred to PVDF membrane).  For one 8.5 X 5 blot, this works out to 85 mA for about 2 hours.
*Block membrane for 1 hr with 5% milk/TBS-Tween (0.1 %).  Use the lid of a pipette tip box and 15 mL fluid to cover blot. (for two blots, use a large tip box and 25 mL fluid for all incubations/washes) Place blot on shaker table for all incubations.
*Incubate overnight with 1:10000 dilution of anti-GFP in 2% milk/TBS-Tween (0.1%)
*Wash 3X in 15 mL TBS-Tween (0.1%) for 10 minutes.
*Incubate 30 minutes with 1:10000 dilution of ECF secondary antibody in TBS-Tween (0.1%)
*Wash 3X in 15 mL TBS-Tween (0.1%) for 10 minutes.

==Analyzing Western==

*Turn on Fluorimager 30 minutes before use.  Put in 570 filter.
*Settings are  PVDF 488/570 df 30, PMT = 500.  Select area to scan.
*Place 1 mL/gel of ECF substrate on a transparency.  ECF substrate in buffer is stored in 1 mL aliquots at –80C.
*Using forceps, lay blot face down on top of substrate (no bubbles) for about one minute (less if bands become visible).  Transfer blot face down to fluorimager plate. 
*Insert plate into machine.  Scan image.  Remove plate immediately.
*Remove plate before shutting down scanner.  Leave software open if anyone is signed up within two hours.
*Clean plate with dI and kim wipes, then with ethanol from the glass bottle.  

==Quantification in ImageQuant==
*Use rectangle tool to draw object around band.  Copy and paste object so that all objects have the same area.
*It is not necessary to define a background in ImageQuant.  Do volume report without background correction, and set the negative control equal to 0 ng/lane for your standard curve. Alternatively, make a new object to define background and set background on all lanes equal to “object ave” for this object. (analyze>>”background correction” to set background correction, then analyze>>”volume report”) (“local average” sets background equal to the average pixel value of the object perimeter.  This will be problematic if bands are not well separated.)  
volume = (average pixel value – background value) * object area
*Double click report to make it an excel file.  Save images and excel volume report.
*Use standard curve to estimate ng gfp/lane for samples and calculate gfp/cell.  The     molecular weight of GFP-SsrA is about 28.3 kDa.
