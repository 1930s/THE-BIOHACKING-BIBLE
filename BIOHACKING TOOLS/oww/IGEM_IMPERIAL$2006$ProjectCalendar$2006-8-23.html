==Biosensor==

*Enzyme has arrived and we have a biosensor available to use, thanks to Dr. Danny O'Hare (unfortunately he is away till Friday!)


==AiiA==

*John C. has managed to track down the AiiA gene (from somewhere in Nottingham, I think). It should be arriving in a few days.


==HPLC==

*Will be discussing the details with Kirsten today. If we can figure out what buffers to used etc. this method may provice a viable alternative or check for our T9002 assay.
