==Myelinated axons==
* Schwann cells form sheath around neuron
* gap = node of Ranvier
* Internode (myelinated portion)
* Node is really small compared with length of internode
** node is less than 1 micron, internode length is about 1 mm
* Leaky pipe model
** At node, Hodgkin-Huxley model for membrane
** Internodes are completely insulated
* Saltatory hypothesis
** Current 'jumps' from node to node
* Experimental tests
** Use core conductor model to infer everything
** measure <math>I_o(z,t)</math> for all z and t.
** data shows decrease in <math>I_o</math> along internode so leaky pipe model not true
*** ''A lot of current is lost along internode''
** Two kinds of derived <math>K_m</math>
*** Biphasic Hodgkin-Huxley like responses (at nodes)
*** Monophasic outward current at internodes consistent with cable model
