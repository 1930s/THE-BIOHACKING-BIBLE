= Overview =
*Project Goal: To develop tools to aid in analysis of personal DNA sequences.   
We would like to develop software and documentation that will help people get from sequence to diagnosis.  At the moment, we are focusing on identifying and classifying SNPs, but we will broaden this identification to other things like large deletions or insertions or repeats when we have more expertise.  We are attempting to harness the power of other already existing tools, and we would also like to make this tool one that others can build upon.  Specifically, our program will eventually be able to determine location based on BLAST, determine any SNPs based on NCBI SNP, and give a prognosis based on OMIM and online medical databases.

= Project Summary =

This code takes the input from the user (a codon sequence) which is searched against the human database to look for SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms).  This codon sequence is found in BLAST SNP, and any SNPs are reported as an RS number<sup>1</sup>. The query is compared against the sequence in dbSNP to determine if the sequence is really a mutation; if this test passes, the RS number is then is used to generate mesh terms from PubMed, and determines which mesh terms are the most relevant.  The potential disease and the prevalence of this disease (derived from the California State Prevalence data) are extracted from the most pertinent mesh terms.  These mesh terms are then used to get updated news regarding the disease

<sup>1</sup>Aside: one portion of the code accesses BLAST SNP without using RS numbers.  The information acquired through this the BLAST SNP website is queried in OMIM, and the output is as follows: disease name, mutation, and name of the mutation.  The disease name is then used to search different websites for drugs, procedure, and experts regarding the disease, and is used to provide a list of web pages with the disease name searched.
