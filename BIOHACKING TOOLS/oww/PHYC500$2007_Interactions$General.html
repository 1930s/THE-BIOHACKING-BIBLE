==Presentation pre-views possible?==
===Suggestion from David===
Steve, is it practical for a summary, paper, or web link to be posted a few days before any given talk that can provide some preparation for students? 
===Response from Steve===
Hi David -- Yes, that is very practical and a really great idea (to put up "prep material" before the talk). I will see if I can find a published paper from Jeremy Edwards to post and will think about how to do this for future talks. The problem is that it is hard enough to recruit a speaker, much less get them to send us appropriate material :) --[[User:Skoch3|Skoch3]] 00:44, 25 January 2007 (EST)
