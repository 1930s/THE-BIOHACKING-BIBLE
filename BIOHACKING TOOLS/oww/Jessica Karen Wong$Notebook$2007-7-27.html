==Colony PCRs==
*Ran gel of F2620-3K3 and F2620-1AK3 overnight colony pcr's 
**Saw nothing, redoing the colony pcr's
*Overnight plates mostly looked good
**I2057-1AK3 plate had 7 colonies
**I2055-1AK3 had 5
**I2056-1AK3 had 1
**I2055-3K3 and I2056-3K3 had lots
**E0240 had none but looked dried out
**F2620-3K3 and F2620-1AK3 had none/way too small ones
*Spun down and replated E0240-1AK3, I2057-1AK3, I2055-1AK3, I2056-1AK3, F2620-1AK3
*Ran Colony PCR's of I2057-1AK3 (7 colonies), I2055-1AK3 (5 col), I2056-1AK3 (1 col), I2056-3K3 (8 col), I2055-3K3 (8 col)
*Ran overnight colony PCR's of 16 more I2055-3K3


==Digests and Ligations==
*Cleaned overnight digests: E0240-X Not1, E0240-S Not1, F2620 M/X, I2057-X Not, I2057-S Not
*Digested: E0240-X E/X, E0240-S E/S, I2057-X E/X, I2057-S E/S, CCDB in 1AT3 E/S
*Ligated: F2620-3K3, F2620-1AK3, E0240-X to close, E0240-S to close, I2057-X to close, I2057-S to close
*Transformed and plated each ligation
*Made new KAN plates
