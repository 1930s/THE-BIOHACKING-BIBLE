__NOTOC__


==Debrief==
===Protocols===
*Testing pLux in vivo tomorrow and also doing an initial test with the home made cell extract
*Clone tech purified sample of GFP is arriving wednesday and so calibration curves can be constructed on wed/thursday
*New results on our experimental design page
*'''Questions''':Need to look for the pka of the GFP we are using as our cell extract is a pH of 8.2 and thsi could affect the system.
===Vesicles===
*New POPC lipids arrived.
*Continue to make and test vesicles
*Next step is to claify that the suspected vesicles formed are vesicles not mineral oil drops. Look into buying fluorescent lipids to test this
===Lab===
*Continue to make the reaction buffer for our home made cell extract tomorrow and should have it finished tomorrow.
===Modeling Team===
*Normalising the equation for infecter detector
*Next step to look at cell by date and initial data that is coming through from the lab.
