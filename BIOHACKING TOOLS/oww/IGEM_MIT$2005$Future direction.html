:What we have done:
::Make a modular tool
::Input any external signal in a controlled manner
:How to improve:
::Modularity
:::ToxR needs to be "extended to outer membrane
:::Test with primary and secondary antibody setup
:::Use antigen that is not already a dimer
:::Test modularity by using different antigens, signal processing systems and actuators
::Usability
:::Activity must be characterized
:::Could be tested in other chassis
:::Feedback mechanisms and other downstream stuff to demonstrate usability
:System Applications:
::Biosensor
:::environmental application -- test for contaminates
::Research tools
:::Replace other antibody sensors (western blots), cell-cell signaling
:Long term impact
::extending and easing research in synthetic biology
