=== Red Food Coloring: Is it Fluorescent? ===
We added some red food coloring to all the dna we prepared for the iGEM 2007 part kits (1500 parts) to aid the process of visually confirming that 3uL had successfully been deposited in each well of each plate by our automation.  Unfortunately, the presence of the dye seems to disrupt sequencing reactions.

Fluorometric analysis indicates the red food coloring fluoresces at 550 nm when illuminated with white light.  The food coloring is from McCormick and the box is labeled ''Assorted Food Colors & Egg Dyes''.  The main ingredients are: Water, Propylene Glycol, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FD%26C_Yellow_5 FD&C Yellow 5], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allura_Red_AC FD&C Red 40], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brilliant_Blue_FCF FD&C Blue 1], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FD%26C_Red_3 FD&C Red 3], and 0.1% Propylparaben.
