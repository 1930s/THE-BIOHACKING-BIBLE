32-G449, MIT

==Topic of discussion==
Meagan Lizarazo will lead a discussion on automated assembly.


==Remote participation==

Mark Pearrow of CSAIL TIG has set of Kiva with essentially always-on media streams of a '''webcam in the back of the room''' and the video of anything connected to '''vga port 1'''.  Additionally, audio is captured from a lapel mike stored in the cabinet at the back of the room (on which the webcam is perched).  Mark recommends using VLC to connect to the two streams:

 http://xibalba.csail.mit.edu:8080 (main camera/speaker)
 http://xibalba.csail.mit.edu:8081 (slides from laptop input 1)

VLC on Mac OS X cannot open two media streams simultaneously, so Mark suggests making a duplicate copy of the VLC application with a name like 'VLC 2' and using it to connect to the second stream.

Mark is working on a similar setup for Star as well as a "suitcase" version that could be temporarily deployed anywhere.

Alternatives include inviting remote participants to iChatAV videochats, Skype videochats (preferably with the [http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2007/02/experimental_hi.html 640x480 high-resolution option] set) or using [http://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Streaming_HowTo/VLM vlc] or [http://www.apple.com/quicktime/broadcaster/ quicktime broadcaster] to provide similar streams to what Mark has set up.


When the PHPfreeChat is working it would be cool to use a second projector to display the chatroom off to the side.
