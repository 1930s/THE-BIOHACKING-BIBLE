=Things today=

1. Miniprep and sequence LC of J45250 1AT3- DONE (they said I'll most definitely get results by Monday morning, so I can hopefully start a banana time course; if not, I have the prepped DNA of the correct J45250 1AT3 whose LC I stupidly threw out, so I can transform that and start a new LC)

2. Data analysis of plate reader results- DONE (injector still broken; growth curves look like rainbows)

3. Run ALL 18 GC samples- DONE

4. Make the following cultures to prepare for GC tomorrow:

*25-mL J45200 w/ precursor

*25-mL J45250 (1AT3) w/ precursor

*25-mL J45200 w/o precursor (control)

*25-mL J45600

*25-mL J45900

'''Calculation of Precursor'''

We initially forgot to take into account isoamyl alcohol's density when deciding at which concentration to add isoamyl alcohol.  

We used 4.4 uL/10 mL because we assumed density to be 1 g/mL... Thus, .0044 g/.01 L*1 mol/88.2 g = 5 mM

To make the final concentration be 5 mM, we actually want 4.4 uL/.809 (g/mL density)= 5.44 uL.
