===Pathways in Disease===

Many signaling pathways employ spatial organization as a key part of their timing and response to environmental stimuli.  For example, the movement of key proteins in and out of the nucleus is often one of the downstream steps in signal response.  We have taken advantage of this spatial organization to screen for small molecules that affect signaling pathways in cancer cells.  This approach has been highly successful and has contributed to a widely used cell-based screening approach as well as lead compounds in cancer studies.

Currently, we are building on these findings to gain a more quantitative picture of how tumor cells respond to certain drugs.  We employ a combination of high resolution microscopy, genome association technology, modeling and cell-based screens.
