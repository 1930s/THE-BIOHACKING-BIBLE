Links to database items can be made simple thanks to the [[Wikiomics:Intermap]] feature which can be used to connect wikis, but also any web sites which use uniform URL patterns.

Example: <nowiki>[[go:0003777]]</nowiki> is rendered as [[go:0003777]] and points to the corresponding entry of the [http://www.geneontology.org/ Gene Ontology database] (GO). As usual, you can specify display some text instead of the link itself: <nowiki>[[go:0003777 | microtubule motor activity]]</nowiki> is rendered as [[go:0003777 | microtubule motor activity]].

See [[Wikiomics:Intermap]] to know which database shortcuts are available, and suggest yours.
