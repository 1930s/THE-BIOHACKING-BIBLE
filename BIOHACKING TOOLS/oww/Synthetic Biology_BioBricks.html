'''This is a portal for information relating to the [http://parts.mit.edu Registry of Standard Biological Parts]. Please add any information relevant to BioBricks protocols and standards.'''

==Introduction==

The Registry of Standard Biological Parts is a collection of parts: sequences of DNA with specific function that can be combined together to implement more complex functions.  These parts are called BioBricks.
