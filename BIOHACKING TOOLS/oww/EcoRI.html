NEBuffer EcoR I

==Notes==
* Improving the efficiency of [[EcoRI/SpeI Double Digest]].
* '''Reaction Volumes''' - I used to have very inconsistent results when digesting with EcoRI, using the 20&mu;l reaction volume. Using the Knight Lab's 50&mu;l mix has recently given good results.  I haven't tested this enough to say it is a statistically significant result.  --[[User:Bcanton|BC]] 13:39, 2 Jun 2005 (EDT)
* The custom EcoRI buffer provided by NEB contains Triton-X100.  This detergent is very inhibitory in transformations, so direct ligation and cloning of DNA cut in this buffer is problematic.  Remarkably small amounts of this buffer dramatically reduces transformation efficiency.
