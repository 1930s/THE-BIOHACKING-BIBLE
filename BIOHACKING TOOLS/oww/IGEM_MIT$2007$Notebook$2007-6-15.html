*All plates with colonies have feeder colonies

==Plan==

#Plate and look at them.
#At least a couple colonies.
#if lots, pick 2 colonies from each; doesn't matter 5 ul or 10 ul.  Just need 4 different types
#One colony into one tube, and repeat.  So we have 11 innoculation tubes; 2 for each type and all 5 for ddV/ddI. 
#Put LB amp into glass tubes with metal caps (flamed)
#Loop and insert colonies.
#Place plates in fridge
#Place tubes in 37°C room overnight
#Store in refigerator for mini-prep on monday

Tubes:
*2: U V
*2: dV
*2: dV + dI
*5: ddV + ddI
