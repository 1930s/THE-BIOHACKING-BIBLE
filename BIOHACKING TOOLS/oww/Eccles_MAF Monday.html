== '''MAF Monday''' ==

Staff are reminded of the following:
General lab safety/containment:

*Observe PC1/PC2 laboratory practices and procedures as described in AS/NZS 2243.3:2002 Safety in Laboratories Part 3: Microbiological aspects and containment facilities.
*Specifically: Wear lab coats / protective clothing
*Windows can be opened as long as this does not cause air flow into non-PC1/PC2 areas of the building, or pose a contamination/safety hazard.
*Do not use Virkon/Trigene for disposal of GMOs, only for surface decontamination.
*Also:
**check correct signage is evident in PC2 areas
**no coffee cups or evidence of eating in labs
**no lab books on wet areas of work benches - they should be on dry areas demarcated by tape
**lab coats should be worn or on hooks but not on chairs
**all doors closed, freezers locked etc.
