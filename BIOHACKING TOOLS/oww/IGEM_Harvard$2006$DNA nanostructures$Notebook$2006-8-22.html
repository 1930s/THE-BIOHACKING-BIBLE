===Design 5===
Realized that lid oligos were accidentally added in folding of c5.0.A on [[IGEM:Harvard/2006/DNA_nanostructures/Notebook/2006-8-20|8-20]]. Refolding c5.0.A to be just barrel oligos. Will use in PEG fractionation.

==Streptavidin Depletion Assay==
===Protocol===
'''Testing Conditions:'''
*''(A) Unbeaded''
*''(B) Beaded''
*''(C) Free-streptavidin incubated''
*''(D) Free-streptavidin incubated, then beaded''
'''Test Solutions:'''
*(1) c5.0.A (lidless barrel, no biotinylation)
*(2) c5.0.Eb (lidless, outside biotinylation)
*(3) c5.0.Fb (lidless, inside biotinylation)
'''Mix:'''
*''(B) Beaded''
<pre>
28uL agarose streptavidin beads
40uL of each test solution rxn

Spin down; remove supernatant to new tube.
Speedvac to ~40uL
Load 40uL in gel
</pre>

*''(C) Free-streptavidin incubated''
****Free-streptavidin concentration needed
*****1680pmoles on biotinylated boxes + 36pmoles of free biotinylated oligos = 1716pmoles = 1.7nmoles
*****free streptavidin @ 2uM = 2nmol/uL
*****thus, for safety, include 2uL of streptavidin
<pre>
2uL of 2uM streptavidin
40uL of test solution
26uL of H2O

Speedvac to ~40uL
Load 40uL in gel
</pre>

*''(D) Free-streptavidin incubated, then beaded''
<pre>
2uL of 2uM streptavidin
40uL of test solution

Wait 15 minutes

Add 28uL of agarose streptavidin beads
Wait 5 minutes

Spin down; remove supernatant to new tube.
Speedvac to ~40uL
Load 40uL in gel
</pre>

===Gel===
* Gel was 2% agarose in 0.5xTBE, 5uL EtBr, 10mM MgCl2.  Ran for 1.5hr @ 80V in 0.5xTBE supplemented to 10mM MgCl2.

*'''Preliminary Conclusions''':
**no difference seen after adding free-streptavidin, and then beading to the outside biotinylated box (lane 13)
***possible not enough free-streptavidin used
**also, no difference in gel band brightness from untreated to beaded - agarose beads either do not work as well as expected (maybe should use magnetic beads), or the amount used was too low
