==Plasmid requests==
We emailed Professor Golden and requested the following plasmids and their sequences:

*pAM2195 
**Chloramphenicol resistance [NS 2.1]
**P''psbAI''::Lux AB [NS 2.1]
**P''psbAI''::Lux CDE [NS 2.1]
**Ampicillin resistance [for selecting in E. coli, not on a neutral site]
*pAM1579
**Kanamycin resistance [NS 2]
*pAM2314
**Spectinomycin resistance [NS 1]
**Streptinomycin resistance [for selecting in E. coli, not on a neutral site]

==Game plans==
===Preface===
Recall that we want to run two experiments in cyanobacteria:
# '''Control''': A control experiment in which we insert the ''Lux AB/CDE'' genes under the ''psbaAI'' promoter (which is known to oscillate on a circadian rhythm), to callibrate our equipment and verify that the cyanobacteria's luminescence will oscillate. This will duplicate previous research.
# '''BB test''': An experiment in which we knockout the wild-type ''KaiABC'' genes and insert our own BioBrick'd ''KaiABC'' genes, along with ''Lux AB/CDE'' from the control. This will verify that our ''KaiABC'' construct works.

Yesterday we came up with two plans for running these experiments.
===Plan 1===

 Plan 1
                          PCC 7942 (unmodified)
                              /         \
                             /           \
        Control: + AM2195 [NS 2.1]      BB Test: + (AM2195 + BB'd ''KaiABC'') [NS 2.1]

*'''Plan 1 workload'''
**Transformations
**# PCC 7942 + AM2195
**# PCC 7942 + modified AM2195
**# (2) with wild-type ''KaiABC'' knockout
**Mutations
**# Mutate AM2195 for BB compatibility
** Ligations:
**# Ligate mutated AM2195 with BB'd ''KaiABC'' insert

===Plan 2===
 Plan 2
                          PCC 7942 (unmodified)
                                  |
                                  |
                      Control: + AM2195 [NS 2.1]
                                  |
                                  |
                    BB Test: + (AM2314 + BB'd ''KaiABC'') [NS 1]

*'''Plan 2 workload'''
**Transformations
**# PCC 7942 + AM2195
**# (1) + modified AM2314
**# (2) + wild ''KaiABC'' knockout
**Mutations
**# Mutate AM2314 for BB compatibility
**Ligations
**# Ligate mutated AM2314 with BB'd ''KaiABC'' insert)

===Comparison===
Plan 1 has the advantage of running both experiments in parallel. However, we don't yet know whether neutral site 2.1 is large enough to accomodate the resistance cassete, ''LuxABC'', and ''KaiABC'' (> 8kb size).

Plan 2 is conceptually cleaner, since we could reuse our control strain and keep separate functions on separate neutral sites. We also know that our inserts will fit. However, Plan 2 requires the control experiment to finish before starting the test (it's serial, not parallel).

===Nick's suggestion===
Nick suggested merging transformations 2 and 3 of each of the above plans by overwriting the wild-type ''KaiABC'' genes with our own BB'd ''KaiABC'' (plus resistance) via H.R., instead of knocking out the wild-type and inserting our genes at a neutral site in separate steps.

Nick's suggestion works better for plan 2 than for plan 1, since in plan 1 we would need to overwrite the wild-type ''KaiABC'' with our BB'd ''KaiABC'' '''plus''' ''Lux AB/CDE'', which puts the ''Lux'' genes at a different position than the control, making the control less meaningful.

For plan 2, in contrast, we would be building on the control strain, so we wouldn't have to re-insert ''Lux'' at a different place.

==Modeling==
We want to make a model to analyze how the phosphorylation of KaiC changes as you add more KaiC.

The following are Nick’s ideas for the model:


 D[p]/dt = &alpha;(t) – &alpha;[P]
 [P](t) = [P](t – delta t) + &alpha;(t – delta t) – &alpha;[P](t – delta t)
 &alpha;(t – delta t) = sin(t)
 &alpha;(t) = k

 A
 T: add &alpha; (t – delta t) new objects to A
 Remove (at random B length (A) objects from A
 Update phosphorylated state of each member of A 
 Calculate average phosphorylated states of A
 [P] = [0,0,0]

==Hydration of delivered primers==
Peng's 10 primers for extracting and site mutagenesis of KaiABC came in; they were each rehydrated into 250uL of dH20 for a stock solution. Then, 20mM of each was made for use.

In the 250uL stock the concentration is:
  7942_KABC_extF: 94.08 nmol/mL
  7942_KABC_extR: 37.96 nmol/mL
  7942_KABC_crossF: 133.88 nmol/mL
  7942_KABC_crossR: 192.64 nmol/mL
  7942_KABC_pst1R: 154.16 nmol/mL
  7942_KABC_pst1F: 150.28 nmol/mL
  7942_KABC_pst2R: 153.64 nmol/mL
  7942_KABC_pst2F: 168.2 nmol/mL
  7942_KABC_eco1R: 145.84 nmol/mL
  7942_KABC_eco1F: 138.56 nmol/mL

To make a 20mM concentration with ~50 µL volume for each, add:
  7942_KABC_extF: 8uL stock, 37.63uL h20
  7942_KABC_extR: 16, 30.37
  7942_KABC_crossF: 6, 40.16
  7942_KABC_crossR: 4, 38.6
  7942_KABC_pst1R: 6, 46.28
  7942_KABC_pst1F: 6, 45.084
  7942_KABC_pst2R: 6, 46
  7942_KABC_pst2F: 6, 50.46
  7942_KABC_eco1R: 6, 43.75
  7942_KABC_eco1F: 6, 41.568

==PCR from dead PCC7942==
The goal here is to extract the kaiABC gene cluster from our dried out PCC7942 plates.
'''Result''': fail =(

Each person did 3 samples; 2 experimental and one control.

The experimental had:
  5uL template
  5uL 10x Buffer
  1uL dNTP (10mM ea) 
  1uL Primer (extF)
  1uL Primer (extR)
  0.5uL HotStarTaq
  36.5uL dH20

The run cycle was:
  #94C, 15'
  #94C, 30"
  #56C, 30"
  #72C, 1.5'
  #Cycle to step 2, 7x
  #94C, 30"
  #65C, 30"
  #72C, 1.5'
  #Cycle to step 6, 30x
  #72C, 5'
  #4C hold

Egel results show nothing good...
