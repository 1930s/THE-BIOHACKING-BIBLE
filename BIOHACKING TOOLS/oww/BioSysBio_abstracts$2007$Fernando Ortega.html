==Background/Introduction==
The quantitative study of metabolic responses in intact cells is essential for predicting the phenotypic consequences of genetic manipulations. Metabolic responses have been described within the framework of metabolic control analysis (MCA) [1]. One of the central goals of MCA is to determine how the responses of system variables, quantified by control coefficients, depend on the kinetic properties of the component reactions or groups of reactions (modules).
Attempts to extend infinitesimal control analysis to large changes in the variables have been reviewed in previous publications [2,3].<br />
In the present contribution, we analyse how some kinetic features of the modules constraint the sensitivity of large metabolic responses. In particular, we explore the different kinds of flux control profile that can be achieved using modules that follow two different types of rate equations: Michaelis-Menten and Hill.

==Results== 
In this study, we consider that the metabolic network can be split
into a supply module (<math>v_{1}</math>), that produces the intermediate
S, and a demand module (<math>v_{{2}}</math>), that consumes <math>S</math> (scheme)
[4]. This top-down or modular MCA approach has been widely used
to analyse the sensitivity properties of metabolic networks [5].
Firstly, the rates and vs. S were chosen to obey a reversible Michaelis-Menten
and Hill equation respectively (see Figure for details). The maximal
activities of module 1 and 2 are modified by the factor <math>r_{{1}}</math>
and <math>r_{{2}}</math>, respectively (one at a time). The system starts
at a reference steady-state o, where <math>r_{{1}}=r_{{2}}=1</math>.
After the parameter is changed (<math>r_{{1}}</math> or <math>r_{{2}}</math>)
the variables of the system (<math>S</math> and <math>J</math>) freely adjust to the final
steady state.

In the Fig. we plot the mean flux and metabolite control coefficient
for both modules when subject to large changes in the enzyme concentrations
or activities. The infinitesimal control coefficients (<math>r_{{1}}=r_{{2}}=r=1</math>)
are <math>C_{{v1}}^{{J}}=0.58</math>, <math>C_{{v2}}^{{J}}=0.42</math>,
and <math>C_{{v1}}^{{J}}=|C_{{v2}}^{{S}}|=1.05</math>. But
for large changes, which module shows the greatest control depends
on the value of <math>r</math>. In the interval (0.56-1.8) the greatest flux
control is in module 1, meanwhile outside this interval the flux is
mainly controlled by the second module. Regarding the control of <math>S</math>,
for <math>r>1</math>a change in module 1 produces a greater effect on <math>S</math> than
module 2, while for <math>r<1</math> module 2 has the greatest effect.

On the other hand, if both modules fulfil M-M rate equation it can
be demonstrated that for all values of <math>r</math> one of the modules has
the greatest flux control (results not shown).

==Materials/Methods==
The mean control coefficient quantifies the sensitivity of a steady-state
metabolic variable (<math>W</math>) to changes in a parameter (<math>p</math>). It is
defined as <math>\overline{C_{p}^{W}}=((W_{{x}}-W_{{o}})/W_{{o}})/((p_{{x}}-p_{o})/p_{o})</math>.
It represents the relative change in <math>W</math> divided by the relative
change in p when the system goes from one initial (<math>o</math>) to one final
steady state (<math>x</math>) [2].

==Conclusion and Discussion==

We have analysed two different models to see if certain patterns of
control for large changes could be, in principle, obtained using modules
whose rates are governed by usual rate equations. We have shown that, if the rates of both modules obey hyperbolic kinetics,
the flux control distribution is constrained, one module having the
greatest control over all enzyme activity range. On the contrary,
if the rate of the demand module follows a Hill kinetics, which module
has the greatest control on the flux depends on the enzymatic activity
change.
