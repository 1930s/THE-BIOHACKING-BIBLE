==== General Protocol ====
'''Prepare Cell Cultures'''

* Devices are to be constructed in week 6 and transformed into the relevant strains.
* Remove stored cultures and incubate over night at 37<sup>o</sup>C with selectable solution and shake. This is to allow amplification of the culture. Grown '''Overnight''' 
<br>
* Remove cultures and add to a new medium that contains relevant selectable solution (e.g. amplicillin). This allows cells to enter exponential growth phase.
* This new medium is inncolulated to an O.D.600 of 0.1. This medium is grown for '''2 hours'''.
<br>
* After 2 hours this sample is then used to inoculate a new culture of medium, again to an O.D.600 of 0.1.
* The result are colonies of a set optical density. In addition the cells are vortexed and the supernaunt removed, this is to help limit any diffusional constraints on addition of the inducer to the relevant promoter.

==== Fluorometer ====
''' ~2-4 hours'''
* The sample can be loaded into wells (200ul)
* To this then the specific concentration of inducer is added.
* Two controls are used, one for the growth medium and one for the fluorescence calibration curve.
*At set time intervals the absorbance and the fluorescence is measured. Later this will be converted into '''GFP synthesis cfu <sup>-1</sup> sec <sup>-1</sup>''' using the calibration curves.
