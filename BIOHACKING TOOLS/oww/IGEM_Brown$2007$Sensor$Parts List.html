The LuxI gene is in the registry as C0061, we might use part BBa_C0261.

The LacI gene seems to be in the registry in two forms, with and without an LVA degradation tag. One part with the tag is BBa_C0012, one part without the tag is BBa_I12224.

The leakiness repressor part with aiiA is in the registry as BBa_I13208.

The detector/feedback loop is in the registry along with LuxR under the control of pTet as BBa_J37015. We simply need to find a way to put in the PbrR gene under the control of pTet to finish making the entire detection module.
