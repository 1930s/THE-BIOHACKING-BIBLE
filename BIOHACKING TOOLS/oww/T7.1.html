{{Rebuilding T7}}

==Background==
Wild-type T7 is a superb organism for discovering the primary components of a natural biological system.  However, our experience indicates that the original T7 isolate is not best suited for understanding how all the parts of the phage are arganized to encode a functioning whole.  We decided to engineer a surrogate genome, which we designated T7.1, that would be easier to study and extend.

==Goals==
#We wanted to insulate and enable independent manipulation of all identified genetic elements.  
#We wanted the T7.1 genome to encode a viable bacteriophage; at the start of this work, we were uncertain how many simultaneous changes the wild-type genome could tolerate. 

==Method==
[[Image:Genome_design_algorith.jpg|thumb|'''Genome Design Algorithm''']]
#Reannotation of the wild-type T7 genome, thus defining the functional genetic elements
#Specification of T7.1 genome design and sequence
#Construct sections individually
#Construct chimeric phages that contain replace a single wild-type section with a rebuit section
#Combine sections of rebuilt phage into a single rebuilt phage
#Characterize chimeric phage

==Progress==
#[[T7.1/Reannotation|Reannotation of the T7 Genome]] -- The wild-type T7 genome is a 39,937 base pair linear double-stranded DNA molecule.  We annotated the genome by specifying the boundaries of the following functional genetic elements: 57 open reading frames, 57 putative RBSs encoding 60 proteins, and 51 regulatory elements controlling phage gene expression, DNA replication, and genome packaging.  A genbank file of the reannotation can be found [http://web.mit.edu/endy/www/ncbi/T7.1/T7.WT.gb here].
#[[T7.1/Specification|Specification of T7.1 genome]] -- The designed sequence of T7.1 can be found [http://web.mit.edu/endy/www/ncbi/T7.1/T7.1.gb here].  [[Image:T7-1-sections_alpha-beta.jpg|thumb|T7.1 genome design (sections ''alpha'' and ''beta'').]]
#[[T7.1/Construction|Contructing the T7.1 Genome]] -- We constructed sections ''alpha'' and ''beta''; the as built sequences can be found [[T7.1/Construction#Sequences|here]]
#[[T7.1/Evolution|Evolution of the T7.1 Genome]] -- We are starting to evolve the T7.1 genome to regain some fitness lost during the refactoring.
