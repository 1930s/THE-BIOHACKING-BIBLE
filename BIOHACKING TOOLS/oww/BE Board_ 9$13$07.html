•	Interlab trivias and luncheons (4 * $100) $400<br> 
•	Diversity Seminars (2 * $50) $100 <br>
[[BE Board Meetings]] (12 * $100 / meeting) $1200<br> 
[[New Events Fund]] $500 ($1000) <br>
<br>
Sub Total $13,800<br> 
10% Fund Fee $ 1,380 <br>
Total $15,180 <br>
Low estimate of surplus from ’06-’07 $ 3,000<br> 
Funding allocation requested $12,180 <br>
<br>
The proposed numbers are listed with last year’s budget in parentheses. Mostly, the funds have been redistributed to reflect where they were spent this year (more to social and less to academics). IM funding was increased to account for the potential influx of undergrads on IM teams who will need shirts. In addition, the cost of both summer softball teams are included with the hockey registration costs. The fines have been shifted to the equipment category to ensure softball teams are registered next year without too much trouble. Funds for academic events and the new event fund have been modified to reflect the current level of participation in the department. <br>
<br>
Overall, the budget is increased 3.5% in concurrence with inflation and the new distribution of funds should better suit the incoming board to producing events that will engage students. In addition, there will be surplus funds from this year’s budget (low estimate of $3000) which diminishes the requested allocation for the new school year. The actual surplus funds can be reported as of Aug 30th if there is difficulty in allocating the funding requested. <br>

'''Outgoing tasks for the 2006-2007 BE Board'''<br>
1. Update the BE Board Wiki (Internal Information & Member Description)<br>
Internal:  http://www.openwetware.org/wiki/BE_Board:Internal<br>
	Members: http://www.openwetware.org/wiki/BE_Board:Members<br>
The members link is present on the BE Board webpage and should contain a job description, while the internal page is a hidden link and is for more detailed ‘how to’ info about the job.<br>
<br>
2.  Change over your position’s e-mail list<br>
Each position has its own generic e-mail list (be-coordinators, be-social, etc).  Old officers should add new members to the list and then remove themselves.  This list is self-owned, therefore we cannot do this for  you.  List management is through Moira, Athena’s list management software (requires certificates):<br>

<br>
'''New Member Information for the 2007-2008 BE Board'''<br>
1.  Setup an account with openwetware<br>
Our BE Board webpage is in a wiki format, where all BE Board members contribute to keeping information on the page up to date.  To start, you will need an openwetware account [Click on ‘create account’ at www.openwetware.org].  <br>
<br>
2.  Editing the BE Board webpage<br>
In order to get to the version of the BE Board webpage that is editable, you must go to:<br>
http://www.openwetware.org/wiki/BE_Board.  In order to edit an item, click on the edit link on the top of the page.  There is some literature on openwetware about editing pages, however, most things can be done by looking at the code for other pages and using it as an outline.  If you need help, don’t hesitate to ask!<br>
<br>
3.  Adding events to the BE Board Calendar<br>
Our BE Board webpage has a calendar which we keep updated with any BE event.  Please put all events you schedule into the calendar through google (calendar.google.com)<br>
	Login ID:  beboard@mit.edu<br>
	Password: calendar<br>
<br>
4. E-mail announcements to the BE department<br>
Since we do such a great job of keeping our webpage up to date (particularly the calendar), we would like to direct more BE Student to our website.  Therefore, all e-mails that go out to the department should include a link to our website.
http://beboard.openwetware.org/<br>
<br>
There are a few options for getting announcements out to the department depending on the target audience.  If using bestudents@mit.edu, make sure to send also to be-mengstudents@mit.edu and be-postdocs@mit.edu so the M. Eng. students and postdocs are not left out. The M.Eng'ers are on be-list@mit.edu along with faculty and staff. Use grave caution in sending to be-list, as people get annoyed by inappropriate messages.  The be-list, bestudents and be-postdocs lists are moderated, therefore all messages must be approved by a moderator before they go out.  This is typically quick on normal business hours, however can be slow on the weekends or evenings.  If you need to reach students quickly, go for the be-200X@mit.edu class lists (non-moderated).<br>
