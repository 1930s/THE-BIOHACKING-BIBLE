From: [http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/D/DoubleHelix.html]
*The double helix makes a complete turn in just over 10 nucleotide pairs, so each turn takes a little more (35.7 &Aring; to be exact) than the 34 &Aring; shown in the diagram.
*3.4 &Aring; separate the planes in which adjacent base pairs are located.
