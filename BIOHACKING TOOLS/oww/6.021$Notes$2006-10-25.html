==Hodgkin-Huxley==
* squid giant axon
* action potentials don't depend on pumps (can knock them out and still have AP)
* for action potential, either <math>G_{Na}</math> increases or <math>G_{K}</math> decreases to increase membrane potential towards <math>V_{Na}</math>
** experimental data indicates <math>G_{Na}</math> goes up
** but which is cause and which is effect? does action potential cause change in sodium conductance or does change in sodium conductance cause action potential?
* Space clamp (Curtis)
** converts 2D to 1D <math>V_m(z,t) \rightarrow V_m(t)</math>
* Voltage clamp (Hodgkin)
** Takes space clamp but also fix membrane voltage
** Can't have action potential if voltage is fixed, but can study membrane response
** Responses are all graded
* General strategy of Hodgkin-Huxley
*# apply voltage step
*# measure response
*# make circuit model <math>V_m(t) \rightarrow J_m(t)</math>
*# run circuit backwards <math>J_m(t) \rightarrow V_m(t)</math>
*#* see if get action potential (and win Nobel prize)
* A voltage step leads to an impulse of current
** looks like a a capacitor's response
** membrane is like capacitor ~1<math>\mu</math>F/cm<math>{}^2</math>
** capacitive response is linear so can subtract it by adding response to depolarizing step with an equal hyperpolarizing step
** this gives the non-capacitive response
* As increase <math>V_m^f</math> (final value of the voltage step)
** persistent outward current increases
** transient inward current becomes transient outward current
** flips about +57mV, close to <math>V_{Na}</math>
*** transient part likely due to Na
** Set <math>V_m^f=V_{Na}</math> so that the sodium current must be 0. The response then is <math>J_K</math>.
** To get <math>J_{Na}</math>, keep the membrane potential the same but change <math>c^o_{Na}</math> which changes <math>V_{Na}</math>
