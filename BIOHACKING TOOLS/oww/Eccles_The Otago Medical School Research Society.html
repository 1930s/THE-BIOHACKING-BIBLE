Dr. Kurt Krause is a professor of Biochemistry at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. He 
obtained his M.D. at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas in 1980. He received his M.A. and 
Ph.D. in Chemistry from Harvard University in 1983 and 1986, respectively. He carried out his doctoral 
research in the laboratory of Nobel Laureate William N. Lipscomb, Jr. His research areas include 
structural biology of infectious diseases, structure-aided drug design, protein crystallography, X-ray 
diffraction, structure and function of enzymes and proteins including antibiotic targets, redox proteins, 
nucleases, luciferase, and bacterial pathogenesis factors. Dr. Krause is board certified in Internal Medicine 
and is a specialist in infectious diseases. He has extensive experience in the treatment of HIV/AIDS and 
tuberculosis. 
 

Dr. Krause has over 20 years of experience in protein crystallography including purification and 
crystallization of proteins, high resolution data collection, structure determination via MAD, MIR as well 
as molecular replacement methods, building and refinement, and structural interpretation.  In his group 
there is a long-standing interest in the structure and function of drug targets, virulence factors and redox 
proteins, especially those from highly pathogenic organisms. Dr. Krause also has experience in 
MIC/MBC determinations in drug resistant bacteria and in mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance.
