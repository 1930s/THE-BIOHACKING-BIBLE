Given the programming content of 20.180's assignments and the [http://openwetware.org/images/4/40/UnixPython_Tutorial_2006.pdf superb tutorial] composed by our TA predecessors, we've assumed that the class has had some experience with Python.  

So, rather than offer a purely introductory tutorial to programming + Python we've instead cooked up a short refresher course.  We've produced a [http://openwetware.org/images/e/eb/20.181.cheat.sheet.pdf Python+Emacs+Shell cheat sheet] and will be doing a basic demonstration of how to run Python and use its data structures Friday Sept. 8th, at 10 AM in 48-216.  If you find any errors in the cheat sheet, please email them to Lawrence.  If you'd like to personalize your own copy of the cheat sheet, here's the [http://openwetware.org/wiki/Image:Cheat_sheet.tex .tex file] used to produce it.

For any eager beavers out there, [http://openwetware.org/wiki/Image:Fibonacci_example.zip here's the code] that we'll be walking through this Friday.  The main piece of code we'll be looking at is Fibonacci_tutorial.py.
