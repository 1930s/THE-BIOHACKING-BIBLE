===MACS Assay - his and strep AIDA cells and his and strep OmpA1 cells with RFP (7/31/07)===

Purpose: To re-test our construct and to test the OmpA loop idea.

#OD equilibriated to 0.5
#Followed [[IGEM:Harvard/2007/Protocols/Indirect Magnetic Labeling Protocol|Indirect Magnetic Labeling Protocol]]
##Used 125 ul of Strep/His and 125 ul of RFP Bacteria
##Used 8 ul his antibodies and 16 ul strep antibodies
##Used 20 ul of Beads
#Then follow [[IGEM:Harvard/2007/Protocols/Magnetic Separation|Magnetic Separation]]
##Use the additional measures

===MACS Assay results (7/31/07)===

Results: There was background binding that we did not want, with about an even amount of red and white cells in both constructs.  Also, the AIDA constructs grew slower as we had expected.

Conclusions: This time, we fear we may have used too small of a antibody to cell ratio, and the increased cell density would cause background binding.

===Electroporation of S23-I07 sender cells into AIDA1-his and AIDA1-strep containing cells 7/30/07===

1) Inoculate cells from plate or liquid culture etc.<br>
2) Grow to an OD of 0.4 to 0.8 which corresponds to log growth.<br>
3) Put 1ml into 1.5 ml tubes.<br>
4) Pellet via centrifugation at 14k rpm (max) for 30 seconds, remove supernatant and resuspend in 1mL of prechilled water.  Do this 2 times.<br>
5) For the third time, after centrifugation, remove supernantant and resuspend in prechilled water containing DNA at desired concentration. (50ng of DNA in 50 uL of water)<br>
6) Transfer to prechilled cuvettes. Avoid air bubbles.<br>
7) Wipe sides of cuvette thoroughly to remove water.<br>
8) Put into electroporator: for 0.1cm gap cuvettes, 1.8kV; for 0.2cm gap, 2.5kV.<br>
9) Press pulse button to electroporate. Record time constants (ms) Result: Time Constant 5.5<br>  
10) Immediately resuspend in liquid media (1ml).<br>
11) Let recover in incubator for 1 hour.<br>
12) Plate on selective agar plates to isolate transformed colonies. Grow overnight.<br>
------
===Results of Electroporation 7/31/07===
#Plated 10ul and 200ul on LB with Kan and Amp.  Results: about a dozen colonies on the 200ul plates.  Pick one or two for overnight growth.  RFP from sender appears to be leaky.

===MACS Assay - his and strep AIDA cells with smaller concentration (7/31/07)===

Purpose: To re-test our construct and to test the OmpA loop idea.

#OD equilibriated to 0.28
#Followed [[IGEM:Harvard/2007/Protocols/Indirect Magnetic Labeling Protocol|Indirect Magnetic Labeling Protocol]]
##Used 250 ul of Strep/His and 250 ul of RFP Bacteria
##Used 10 ul his antibodies and 16 ul strep antibodies
##Used 20 ul of Beads
#Then follow [[IGEM:Harvard/2007/Protocols/Magnetic Separation|Magnetic Separation]]
##Use the additional measures

-----------

===MACS Assay results (8/01/07)===

Results: Still lots of background binding.  Questioning whether or not the antibodies are not specifically binding.
Conclusion: We need to find out what should be changed in the protocol to lessen the background.
