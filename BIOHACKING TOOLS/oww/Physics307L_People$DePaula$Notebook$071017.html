==Day 2==
Today we calibrated the spectrometer with mercury, just like we did on day 1.  This time it was much easier and we feel that it is more accurate and precise this time than last time. We rand through the calibration  a few times and our data reflects high accuracy.  We switched out the mercury tube for a hydrogen tube, and turned the brass knob counterclockwise until it stopped.  This is where we began data collection for hydrogen.  We Started each trial this way, as to avoid gear knock.  We recorded each value once per pass.  After a few trials we reversed the direction of scan, and took data starting at the opposite end of the spectrum first.  Here is a link to the raw data we recorded. [[Media:Raw Data.xls]]
We also used the exact same process for Deuterium.  Narration of this lab is quite bland, the interesting part begins with data reduction, which is entirely in our lab summary.  After finishing the deuterium we also used the exact same process for Krypton.  Unfortunatly Krypton does not glow green like Superman comics lead me to believe.

You do not need to go all the way to the end each time, just make sure to go enough past the value in one direction and then come back the other way.}}
