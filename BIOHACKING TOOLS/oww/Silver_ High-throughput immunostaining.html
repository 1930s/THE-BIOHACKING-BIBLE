==Detection of 14-3-3 in U2OS and HeLa cells by immunofluorescence==

#Seed ~3000 cells in 384-well plates.
#Fix cells with 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes at RT.
#Wash 1 time with PBS.
#Permeabilize cells with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 minutes.
#Wash 2 times with PBS.
#Block with 3% BSA in PBS for 30 minutes at RT (can leave O/N at 4C).
#Incubate with primary antibodies for 60 minutes. 
#*Antibody solution should contain 1% BSA.
#*14-3-3Ïƒ monoclonal is diluted 1:5.
#Wash 2 times with 0.05% NP-40.
#Wash 2 times in PBS.
#Incubate with secondary antibodies and DAPI (all at 1:1000) for 1 hour.
#Wash 2 times with PBS.
#*Leave covered in PBS for storage at 4C and visualizing.
