== Words to Look Up ==

== Talk ==
* 90% of inhaled oxygen consumed in mitochondria in cell resperation
* used in research
** human evolution
** DNA fingerprinting - last czar of Russia
** fertility
** origin of eukaryotes
** sex determination
** conflict of selfish genomes
** apoptosis
** calcium and redox signaling
** mitochondrial theory of ageing
* were once bacteria - why endosymbiosis?, what kind of bacteria?, what host?
** perhaps ricketsia - but disputable
** alphaproteobacteria
* three propositions
** all complex life composed of eukaryotic cells - bacteria not capable of true complexity
** all eukaryotes have or have had mitochondria - aquisition of mitochondria key event in origin of eukaryotes
** all mitochondria retain a genome
* power - complexity depends on mitochondrial energy generation
* sex - why there are 2 sexes
* suicide - why we grow old and die

=== all complex life composed of eukaryotic cells ===
* Ernst Haeckel - illustrationsist (Rando door)

=== all eukaryotes have or have had mitochondria ===
* Tom Kavalier-Smith (here at conference) (1980s)

=== all mitochondria retain a genome ===
* no concensus why
** maybe not enough time
** Alberts - no compelling reason why proteins made there and not cytosol
* Gray, Science, 1993, 283, 1478 - Mitochondrial Evolution 
** overlap of mitochondrial genomes
** plasmodium mitochondria only retained 3 genes
* cyanide acts on complex 4 - one of proton pumping proteins
* maybe retain mitochondrial genes to control respiration
** with multiple mitochondria - if one deficient in a protein, nucleus sends out to all
** if each mitochondria retains, can control locally
** complexes continually overturned
** requires mitochondria genomes encode core subunits
** rate of assembly depends on stability of mRNA of mitochondrial genes
** should have excess of nuclear products
* Morano-Lashuertos, Nature Genetics, 38, 1261, 2006
* limit to cell size determined by respiration

=== power - complexity depends on mitochondrial energy generation ===
* surface area to volume ratio falls by mass^2/3
** respiratory efficiency falls away with larger size, and replication rate falls
** one way around is to internalize membrane to gain surface area
* why bacteria don't get past a certain size, and thus complexity
* eukaryotes retains control with extra gene outposts in mitochondria to manage respiration
* Amouba dubia has genome of 670,000 Mb - 200x larger than human genome, 80,000x larger than S. ceriviciae
** karyotypic ration in euxaryotes constant - large cells accumulate more genes and more DNA

=== sex - why there are 2 sexes ===
* 2 sexes limit to 50% of population - seems odd
** not universal - slime mold Phsarum polycephalum - 13 sexes in a pecking order - mitochondria ranked
* female sex specializes to pass on mitochondria to next generation
* male does opposite - mitochondria are eliminated from sperm
* exception - Chlamydomonas inherets mt from both parents, but paternal digested within a few hours of fertilization
* explanations
** selfish cytoplasmic genomes (Herst and Hamilton) - need to cut out competition between genomes (so don't risk throwing away respiration)
*** exception - heteroplasmic (more than one mtDNA genome) - 20% humans, 20% angiosperms, many bats
** John Allen - requirement for inactive genetic template - mtDNA damaged by free radicals produced during ATPsynthesis
* why can't sperm by powered by fermentation - humans sperm powered by mt (discovered 2001)
* yeast can survive on fermentation - not as reliant on mitochondria - mutation that knocks out mitochondria - 10,000 faster rate of mutation
* falure for mt and nuclear subunits leads to apoptosis
** best way to co-adapt is to test one set of mt genes against one nuclear background
** need a sex to pass on the mt so can do this test
** where does this selection take place - in the embryo. at least 25% die for unknown reasons - perhaps incompatibility between mt genome and nuclear background
*** look to cloning and fertility treatments
**** cloning requires this perfect match - Dolly aged prematurely

=== suicide - why we grow old and die ===
* free radicals produced right next to mtDNA 
* damage accumulates with age as a result of continuous respiration
* rate of free-radical production correlates with life span
* Denham Harman - free radical theory of aging in 1954, mt theory of aging in 1970s
* mutations in mtDNA lead to gradual loss of nuclear-mt subunit co-adaptation
** leads to loss of cytochrome c - leads to apoptosis
* problem with aging in tissues not replaced by stem cells - brain, heart
* rats get same disease as humans - just much faster (3 years rather than 60 years)
** the clock has something to do with free radical production
* aging - shrinkage of tissues by apoptosis
* birds have rather leak proof mitochondria - live much longer
* rat and pidgeon have about some basal metabolic rate - rat lives 3 years, pidgeon about 30
* Tanaka, Lancet, 351, 186, 1998 - looked at mt point mutation with age (mt5178A,mt5178C)
** after age 60 - huge difference in going to a hospital with these 2 mutations
** mt5178A - 1/2 as likely to have any age onset disease (heart, diabetes, etc.), and 2x likely to live past 100
* free radical leak depends on reduction state of complex 1
** rat - highly reduced - more electrons in it
** pidgeon - more oxidized
** rate of leakage if chain is blocked is the same
** perhaps birds have need for more mitochondria - flying needs - so pidgeon might have 'spare capacity' - fewer reductions - higher oxidation state
* calorie restriction induces biogenesis - PLoS Medecine Calorie Restriction Increases Muscle Mitochondrial Biogenesis in Healthy Humans
* wine - resveratrol (red grape skins) - doubles mitochondrial density in muscles and brown fat via SIRT-1 (probably)
* NO-donors stimulates mitochondrial genesis via cyclic GMP - phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as Viagra
