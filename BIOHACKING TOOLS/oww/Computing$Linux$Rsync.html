*Rsync is a program useful for making backups.  Example:
 /usr/bin/rsync -a /home/username/ /path/to/backupdir

*If a file was originally in both source/ and destination/ (from an earlier rsync, for example), and you delete it from source/, you probably want it to be deleted from destination/ on the next rsync:
 rsync -a --delete source/ destination/

*Directory vs files:
**rsync -a /source /dest - copy "source" directory; result: /dest/source/sourcefiles
**rsync -a /source/ /dest - copy contents of "source"; result: /dest/sourcefiles

*Useful options:
 -a, --archive
              This  is equivalent to -rlptgoD. It is a quick way of saying you
              want recursion and want to preserve almost everything.
              Note however that -a does not preserve hardlinks, because  find-
              ing  multiply-linked  files  is  expensive.  You must separately
              specify -H.
 -r, --recursive             recurse into directories
 -l, --links                 copy symlinks as symlinks
 -p, --perms                 preserve permissions
 -t, --times                 preserve times
 -g, --group                 preserve group
 -o, --owner                 preserve owner (root only)
 -D, --devices               preserve devices (root only)
 --exclude=PATTERN       exclude files matching PATTERN (--exclude ´*~´)
 --delete-excluded       also delete excluded files on the receiving side
