==Amplification Culture of OriT_J23066_OriT_pSB1A2(''fast T4 ligase'')==
*select Positive OriT_J23066_OriT_pSB1A2 Colonies from Plate, Culture in liquid LB,waiting for mini-prep. 

==transformation OriT_J23066_OriT_pSB1A2 (normal T4 ligase)==
*transformation OriT_J23066_OriT_pSB1A2 ligate by  ''nomal T4 ligase'' .
*Culture at Amp+ plate for 12 hours. 
*NEXT DAY: 200+ cloney received. 
*F-OriT_J23066_OriT_pSB1A2 self-ligation nagetive-control received no clones.

==Mini-prep: E0040.B0015(pSB3K3) Self-Ligation==
*The purpose of this miniprep is to confirm that the colonies in the negative control plate are with self-ligated vector but not other contaminating plasmids.
*Using Transgen mini plasmid purification kit.
*50 uL per tube after purification, 1 tube.
===Mini-prep Double Digesting Test Result===
*Digesting the plasmid with EcoRI/PstI.
*Digesting the verified E0040.B0015(pSB3K3) plasmid as a control. 
*Each digestion system contains：

<pre>
1 µl       10*H buffer
0.25 µl    EcoRI
0.25 µl    PstI
5 µl       Plasmid
3.5 µl     ddH20
--------------------------
10 µl      Total
</pre>
*37℃ culutre for 3 hours.
*from ''left'' to ''right'':
#Self-ligated @ EcoRI/PstI
#Proper-ligated @ EcoRI/PstI
#marker (DL2000 Plus) 
[[Image:Example.jpg]]
*Conclusion: the self-ligated plasmids can not be digested as the proper-ligated plasmids, which means the digestion sites of self-ligated plasmids are altered. It is as expected.

==Key1 & Lock1 Efficiency Test==
*Prepare R0040.J23078.E0040.B0015(pSB3K3)-DH5a competent cells.
*Totally 16 tubes, 100uL/tube.
