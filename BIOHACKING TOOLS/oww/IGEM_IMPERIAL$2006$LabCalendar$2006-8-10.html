==Immunotag PCR==

* Ran gel of PCR products
* However nothing showed up and our problems with PCR continue
*Dr Mann is running both the lox and immunotag PCRs in his lab. 
*Tomorrow we find out whether we are in actual fact incompetent or there is something genuinely wrong with our protocol/primers.

==Miniprep and digest==
*12 colonies from ligation 12D -> 2H  were minipreped and digested with EcoR1 and Pst1
*Update...running gels do not seem to show any successful ligation.  Perhaps we should try regrowing 12D and 2H and maxiprep again?

==Control Digest for finalized prey cell J37015 & pSB1A2==
Three different digests that cut either the part twice or the part and plasmid were set up to assess whether ligations were correctly made:
# Enzymes: HindIII, NdeI (Red buffer)  -  Expected length of DNA fragments: 1856bp and 2836bp
# Enzymes: BglII, Pvu II (Green buffer) - Expected length of DNA fragments: 708 bp and 3984bp
# Enzymes: BglII, Not II (Organge buffer - Expected length of DNA fragments: 899bp and 1738bp and 2055bp
As control, the insert plasmid and the vector plasmid are digested in addition to the recombinant plasmid above. 
Insert plasmid: 12D->24A:
# Expected length of DNA fragments: 3615bp
# Expected length of DNA fragments: 3615bp
# Expected length of DNA fragments: 3615bp
Vector plasmid: 6B:
# Expected length of DNA fragments: 3140bp
# Expected length of DNA fragments: 3140bp
# Expected length of DNA fragments: 2055bp and 1085bp

*Left digests in the fridge overnight since it was too late to run the gel. The gel will be run tomorrow morning. 

==Culture grown up==

*T9002 and J37015 grown up and left overnight for possible testing tomorrow

==Electroporation==
*Electroporated the ligations from yesterday.  Need to culture them tomorrow then miniprep


==Cre PCR==

*PCR has been set up to run overnight
*The aim is to amplify out the Cre sequence from the plasmid that we have (it has no usefully placed restriction sites)
*Gel to be run tomorrow to see if it is successful
