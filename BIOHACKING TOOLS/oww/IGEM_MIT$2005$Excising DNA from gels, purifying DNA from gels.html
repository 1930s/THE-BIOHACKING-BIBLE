I. Loading/running agarose gels
*Background Information:
**use of sample buffer (SB) with tracking dye (how far has it run?) and glycerol (to sink samples into wells of gel)
**demonstration of how to remove comb and load gels
**Run gel toward positive pole (because DNA has negatively charged phosphate backbone)
**Molecular weight standards allow you to tell the size of fragments;  some useful ones we used were:
***1 kb ladder for higher range (1-4 kb)
***phiX174/HaeIII digest for lower range (200 bp-1.3 kb) 
*Exercise:
** Students loaded their PCR reactions (Day 1), uncut plasmid DNA, digested plasmid DNA (Day 2), and MW standards on gel
**ran gel @ 100V to about 1/2 way-->took photo


II. Excising DNA from gels
*Background Information:
**use long wave UV when excising bands from gel—less energy, less damage to DNA
**protect eyes and face with face shield—NO SUNBURN!
**change razor blades between each DNA fragment (prevents cross contamination)
*Exercise:
**students excised "vector" and "insert" bands from double digested  pSB1A3 with help from staff


III.  Purifying DNA from gel
*Exercise:  
**students removed agarose/purified DNA using Qiagen gel extraction kit as specified in protocol
**DNA was saved at 4˚C for use in ligations/transformations
