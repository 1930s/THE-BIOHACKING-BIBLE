** Learn how to parse out HTML to the degree that I can parse out the non-RSSed items on MedStory (ie. Drugs, Experts, etc.)
** Write code to do so
====Progress====
* Wrote code to:
** Get HTML file of searched term from MedStory
** Parse out lists of:
*** Drugs
*** Procedures
*** Experts
*** Drugs in clinical trials
** Parsed out URL of Clinical Trials HTML, but will probably instead show the patient this in an XML format
* All is documented here: [http://openwetware.org/wiki/TChan/Notebook/2007-4-23 Notebook for 4/22/07]
