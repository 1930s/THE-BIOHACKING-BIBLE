The following shows a Perl script that calls libRmath to calculate the Student's
t-distribution. It takes each line of input and calculating the t-distribution 
''P''(''T''<''t'') for the first number with the second number (tab separated) giving the degrees
of freedom.

It illustrates several points about how to use Inline::C, including the use of prefixes and library inclusion.

<code><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use Inline C => "DATA",
  LIBS => '-lRmath -lm',
  PREFIX => 'R_';

while(<>)  {
  chomp;
  my ($q, $df) = split /\t/, $_;
  print pt($q, $df || 5), "\n";
}

__DATA__
__C__

#define MATHLIB_STANDALONE 1
#include <Rmath.h>

double R_pt(double q, int df)  {
  return pt(q,df,1,0);
}
</pre></code>
