==Motivations==
*To see whether oscillations, which match are specifications, are produced. We will have fulfilled our specifications if the oscillations have the following properties:
::*Stable oscillations for greater than 10 cycles
::*High signal to noise ratio
::*Controllable amplitude and frequency
::*(Our system is based on the quorum sensing/quenching system so connectivity is an inherent part of our design. However, more research is to be done to fulfil this specification).

==Protocol==

*A formal protocol has not been written.
*Methods for testing under consideration are:
::*To aliquot the extracellular medium within the chemostat at certain time points and then measure the [AHL] using the T9002/J37016 assay.
::*Use a [http://openwetware.org/wiki/IGEM:IMPERIAL/2006/project/Bio_elec_interface biosensor] to measure oscillating output directly (in this case we would be measuring change in pH in the extracellular medium).
::*Use High Performance Liquid Chromatography (more research is required). 

==Results==

*The prey construct has been built but still needs to be characterized
*The predator construct still needs to be built
