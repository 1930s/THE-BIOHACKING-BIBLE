==Characteristics==
===Extension rate===
*How rapidly a particular DNA polymerase enzyme synthesizes a complementary strand.
===Processivity===
*A measure of how strongly the polymerase binds to template DNA.  Processivity doesn't affect extension rate.  However, it has a strong influence on the absolute length of complementary DNA strand that can be made.
===Proofreading===
*Proofreading is when the multi-functional enzyme adds a deoxynucleotide and then goes back and rechecks the template to complement interaction to make sure the correct nucleotide was added.
*Proofreading polymerases are usually multimeric and thus more expense to make.
*Like all DNA polymerases, proofreading polymerases add an adenine deoxynucleotide to the 3' end of the complementary strand.  Proofreading ensures that this nucleotide is removed again leaving blunt-ended DNA.
