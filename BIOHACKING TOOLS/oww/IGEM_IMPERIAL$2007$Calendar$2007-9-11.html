==Debrief==

===Vesicles===
*Put pTet-GFP into vesicles - need to see what the result is tonight
*Looking at equations relating expression in vesicles - to help with data analysis

===Dry lab===
*Doing the wiki
**graphic design

===Experimental design (wet lab)===
*24 hr experiment on CBD construct - put on hold 
**going to sort the methododlogy first
*Design experiments to test affect of evaporation and how to reduce it
**Mineral oil - possibility but affects oxygen supply too
*Today testing:
**if evaporation prevented by layer of oil
**if layer of oil affects the reading of tehe fluorometer
*Test will be done tomorrow at 37&deg;C using either mineral or paraffin oil (depending on results from today's experiment)
**Will test for affect on expression of the samples due to oil (blockage of oxygen)
*T7 should be ready by tomorrow
====Problems====
*Twinkle can't be moved from the teaching lab - need to talk to biochem lab to use theirs
*DsRED express - will be delivered earlier next week (problem with quality control)
*GFP mut-b3 from the lab - needs to be PCRed and cloned with a tag
*LuxR
**purity < 50%
**Can't get exact [LuxR]
**Need LuxR 10 x the amount of DNA for ID construct

===CBD===
Meeting scheduled with Vincent after tomorrow's debrief 
*Refocus CBD application/specification
**Results so far don't comply with the specification
*Alex - find out what is stopping expression of the pTet construct below 10 and over 45&deg;C
*Might be useful before meeting to get min working temperature
**not possible as experiments put on hold until methodology improved
