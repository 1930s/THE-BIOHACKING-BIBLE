*  Photobioreactor design and construction?
* Parameterization of photobioreactors including mixing, suspension times, partial gas pressures, light intensities?
* Headspace gas collection?
* Are there ways to achieve high throughput hydrogen detection?
* Can we take biomimetic approaches, i.e. materials which mimic the biological process but do not require living cells?
* How to integrate bioenergy products into enduse technologies (e.g. getting hydrogen from bioreactor to the fuel cell)?
