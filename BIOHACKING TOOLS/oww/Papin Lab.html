Welcome to the Computational Systems Biology Laboratory at the University of Virginia, under the direction of Dr. Jason A. Papin.

We are interested in developing methods for integrating high-throughput data of biological systems and characterizing cellular network properties relevant to human disease.  In particular, we reconstruct integrated cellular signaling networks and develop tools to analyze their properties.  The analysis of these networks requires high-performance computing capabilities and sophisticated mathematical techniques.
