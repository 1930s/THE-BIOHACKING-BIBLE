===Agenda: Monday, 7/2===
*Order stuff!
*Summary email to all iGEM


==pBAD33==
*Received pBAD33 promoter and regulatory protein inside pBAD18/24 vector with chloramphenicol resistance
**Maybe actually the pBAD33 vector
*Need to make liquid culture inside LB and CMR
#Make LB and CM
#*Chloramphenicol in freezer at 34 mg/µl (perhaps 1000x)
#*Guzman used 10 µg/ml CM concentration
#*For 500 mL LB, need 147 µL of CM
#*Made 5 labeled tubes filled with 5 mL each of LB and CM
#Made liquid cultures of E. coli w/ pBAD18 (or 33?)
#*Picked 5 discrete colonies with loop and innoculated in test tubes incubated in 32°C warm room ovenight
#Made LB + KAN plates
#*Take 1.2% LB + Agar and heat in microwave at 50% fro 10 minutes
#*Wait until cool to ouch and mix in 1000x 950µl of kanamycin
#*Pour into plates (blue striped)
#Transform FhuA plasmid DNA into E. coli
##Take 10 µg DNA and suspend in 50 µl of water and vortex
##*DNA sample now at 200 ng/µL of DNA
##Take 1 µL of sample and put in eppendorf with 99 µl of water
##*DNA sample now at 2 ng/µl
##*Nanodrop confirms sample at 2.5 ng/µL
##Put 2 ng of DNA or .8 µL into eppendorf with 50 µL of IAT3 competent E. coli
##Tap gently and incubate on ice for 30 minutes
##Put in 37°C waterbath and heat shock for 20 seconds
##Put in 950 µL of LB+KAN and incubate in warm room shaker for 1 hour
##Decant and resuspend in 900 µL LB and Plate
