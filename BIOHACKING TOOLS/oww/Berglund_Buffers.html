Deionization of Formamide <br>
(From short protocols pg.  A1-17)	Mix 50ml of formamide and 2.5 grams of mixed-bed ion-exchange resin and stir 45 min. at room temperature.  Filter through whatman filter paper,  dispense into 30 ml aliquots which are stored at -20° C.  Handle formamide with care, it is a teratogen.  Deionized formamide lasts for 1 yr. if stored at -20° C. Mixed-bed ion exchange resin will work to remove ions from water, also.<br>
