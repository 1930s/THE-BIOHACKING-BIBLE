'''THE STEM (Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope) FACILITY''' 

at Brookhaven National Laboratory

The STEM used to be an NIH Research Resource and as such was available to outside users with appropriate projects free of charge.
We have lost this support, but continue to operate as a User Facility on a Fee-For-Service basis.

We are updating our web page.

See it (reload or refresh)  http://www.biology.bnl.gov/stem/stem.html for details.


'''PURPOSE OF THIS PAGE'''

Our web page (link given above) has essentially all the useful information about the facility and its use.

We will try to use this page for transient information, such as announcements and "news".


'''A NEW POSTING'''

The microscope is now running with our new computer system.  STEM Users who have been using the STEM PCMass programs for analyses and viewing, should be using the most recent version of PCMass29.  It reflects the new data acquisition system, is much more user-friendly, and has more tutorials.  The new, complete, PCMass29 program is now on our ftp site.


'''USERS'''

Most users mail (ON Express) their samples.  Frozen samples, in a well-insulated package with lots of dry ice, will stay frozen for many days -- long enough to clear customs if they are from abroad.  A sample package is shown below (held by Joe and Beth):
