Constructs in this study were assembled from parts in the [http://parts.mit.edu Regisry] via [[BioBricks construction tutorial|standard assembly]]. All constructs were cloned onto [http://parts.mit.edu/r/parts/partsdb/view.cgi?part_id=4659 pSB1A2], a high copy plasmid, in [[E. coli genotypes|MC4100]].
