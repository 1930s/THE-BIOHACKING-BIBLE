The 4&deg;C refrigerator in [http://www.csail.mit.edu/resources/maps/3/311.gif 311] was recently repaired.  However, in the process, it was discovered that refrigerant is leaking from the evaporator coil.  The refrigerant has been refilled but the fridge will fail again once the refrigerant is gone.  Don't put critical items in this fridge.

When placing items in the 4&deg;C refrigerator in [http://www.csail.mit.edu/resources/maps/3/321.gif 321], don't place them too close to the wall dividing the fridge from the freezer.  Items may freeze.
