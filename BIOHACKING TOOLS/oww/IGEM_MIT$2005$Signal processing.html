==POC==
Ray

==Function==
* To eliminate noise from the incoming signal (delivered by the sensor group)
* To deliver a relatively clean and (usually) modular input to the actuator group

==Ideas==
*Continuous to discrete (C/D) converter
*Thresholding based on complementary mRNA competition

==Current Status==
*Threshold device:
**All parts obtained, and are currently undergoing assembly (ready by monday probably)
***I1030 with B0015 --> will be complete
***I1031 with B0015 --> needs R0010/11
***I1032 with B0015 --> needs R0010/11
***E0840 with R0051 --> will be complete


*C/D: Still looking for appropriate proteins (shelved)

==Device Depiction==
*Thresholding device:
**Sample graphs here: [http://openwetware.org/index.php?title=Image:Threshold_protein3_graph.JPG]
[[Image:Threshold protein3.JPG]]

*C/D converter:

==Device Parts==
*Threshold: Have been specified and ordered (see picture above)

==Experiments==
*Objectives:
**Ensure TetR::cI fusion works
**Ensure lambda::GFP fusion works
**Ensure antisense inihibits cI
*Strategy:
**Fix level of IPTG and then vary TetR levels to see the amount of cI needed to express a certain amount of GFP
**Change IPTG level, then repeat previous step.

==Issues/Questions==
*Do cell lines naturally have TetR repressors? or do I need to insert them?
*Assembly of various devices: One plasmid? different plasmids?

==Need Help With==
Nothing.. Nada..

==Wishlist==
*Feedback mechanism

==Notes==
*This group has secondary priority to the rest. It will gain prominence after the other devices are ready.
*cI system has internal thresholding built into the system. We may not be able to tweak it for our own nefarious purposes.
