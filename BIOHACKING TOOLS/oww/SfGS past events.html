'''April 25: [http://web.mit.edu/sfgs/www/ecoexpo.htm EcoExpo]'''
Eco Expo provided a forum for undergraduate and graduate students involved in sustainability at MIT to showcase their efforts to the greater community. We brought the scope and ingenuity of student-led sustainability initiatives to the attention of the greater MIT audience as well as the local community. Eco Expo featured posters and displays from nearly 30 groups from across campus including Biodiesel@MIT, this year's winner of the MtvU/GE Eco-Imagination Challenge; groups from the MIT Generator; and teams from Sloan's new Sustainability Laboratory.  We sought to convey the incredible energy and enthusiasm currently surrounding sustainability at MIT and inspire new ideas, new connections, and a strengthened campus commitment to sustainability.
