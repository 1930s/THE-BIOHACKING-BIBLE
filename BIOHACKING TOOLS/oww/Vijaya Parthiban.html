I completed my Ph.D. and currently working as a 'staff scientist' in [http://www.cubic.uni-koeln.de Colonge University Bioinformatics Center, Germany]. I was selected for the Ph.D. program in International Max Planck Research School in Cologne in 2002. 

==Institution==

My institution (CUBIC) is one of the highly funded bioinformatics facilities in the world and the quality of research is exceptional in its class. Besides, I have also been selected for the international Ph.D. program offered by IMPRS which involves competitive selection strategies. The scientific, social and career oriented training offered by this program helps the students to compete in international level.

==Research==

As a member of the structural bioinformatics group at CUBIC, the main focus of my work is on computational prediction of protein structural stability. I have analysed and predicted the stability of proteins upon mutations. This study has a huge impact on the industrial applications for designing thermostable mutants, analysing the protein stability upon mutations that cause diseases, etc. The prediction model involves statistical mechanics functions and thorough identification of protein structural factors and has direct implications on protein structure solutions, protein-protein/ligand docking and virtual screening of potential drug targets. The study involves a lot of statistics, mathematics and statistical mechanics and empirical approaches to manipulate the experimental data. I am familiar with statistical tools and libraries to do cluster analysis, PCA, normilization and various linear regressions methods.
