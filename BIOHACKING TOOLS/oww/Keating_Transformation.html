'''Transformation protocol (for pure plasmid)'''

#Do in 1.5mL eppendorf tubes
#50-100ul competent cells (XL1-Blue or BL-21 that were thawed on ice) + 2ul DNA
#Mix by inverting
#Place on ice for 10 minutes
#Place in heat block at 42 degrees C for 2 minutes
#Place on ice for 2 minutes
#Add 700ul of LB
#Incubate at 37 degrees C for 40 minutes
#Plate about 100ul of cells on antibiotic plate
#Incubate at 37 degrees C overnight

'''Transformation after ligation reactions'''

#Use ~150ul compentent XL1-Blue
#Place on ice for 10 minutes
#Place at 42 degrees C for 2 minutes
#Place on ice for 2 minutes
#Add 700ul of LB
#Place at 37 degrees C for 40 minutes
#Spin down cells at 3,000-5,000 rpm
#Pipet off about 500ul
#Resuspend pellet in remainder.
#Plate Â½ of the remainder (175ul)
#Save the other half in the fridge.
#If the plate doesn't have any colonies the following day, you can try plating the other half.
