==Overview==

Procedure for recycling used glass beads.

==Materials==
* lab dispenser soap
* 95% Ethanol

==Procedure==
#collect beads from plastic containers around the benches.
#soak the beads in a larger container with water.
#add soap and mix well.
#* this step is to remove the excess material stuck to the beads.
#rinse the beads with water to remove all trace of soap.
#* it helps to use a strainer.
# rinse the beads with the Ethanol.
#* this step removes residual water.
# transfer beads to glass bead jars.
#* cover loosely with lids and allow the beads to dry (overnight).  autoclaving while still wet may cause the beads to develop a filmy coating.
#autoclave on gravity cyle, tighten lids on after cooling and store.

==Notes==
#right now we don't have a strainer to do rinse steps, I'm going to get one soon. -[[User:Kelsic|Kelsic]]
