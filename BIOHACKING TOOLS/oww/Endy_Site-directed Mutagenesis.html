==Primer Design==
*See [[Designing primers | this page]] for general advice and software suggestions for primer design.
*Primers should contain the mutations to be introduced but should anneal to the sequence to be mutated.  You will need a forward and reverse primer.
*Primers should be between 25 and 45 base-pairs in length.
*The mutation(s) should be in the middle of the primers.
*Mutation efficiency is greatly influenced by the purity of the primers.  Its worth getting purified primers.  No need for 5' phosphorylation.
*See the [http://www.stratagene.com/manuals/200518.pdf Stratagene manual] for more detailed information.

==Experimental Protocol==
*See the [http://www.stratagene.com/manuals/200518.pdf Stratagene manual] for the suggested protocols.  The notes below are suggested modifications to this protocol that may be useful depending on what you are trying to do.
*It makes sense to dilute the mutagenic primers to the same concentration as the control primers used in the [http://www.stratagene.com Stratagene] protocol, i.e. 100ng/&mu;l.
*Leon suggested that attempting to modify three consecutive bases is difficult.  He suggested using 4-5 more cycles than recomended by [http://www.stratagene.com Stratagene].
*Leon also recommended letting the DpnI digestion run for 2-3 hours.  
*Doing a [[PNK Treatment of DNA Ends|PNK step]] on the primers should boost efficiency.
*It is not necessary to use XL1-Blue cells.  Any highly competent cells should be ok.
