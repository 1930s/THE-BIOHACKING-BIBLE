==General Updates==
*Monday meeting TBRun by Maxine
*Assemblies: at beginning of week, we're planning on doing plating -> ON -> miniprep of all constructs needed for upcoming assemblies.
**This turns a ~4 day process into a ~2 day process
*Updated flowchart?
*Registry problems seem to be worked out...
**Should make glycerols for registry of all parts made or assembled
*Will start transitioning to Endy lab early next week, probably.
*Look at all the green on our parts site! Wow!

==SubTeam Updates==

Format: what is the progress? what are the issues?

===Input: Maxine===
1. <b>Fluorescein and Oligo Uptake</b> by competent (lots of competent cells made if anyone needs them) and overnighted MC4100 culture

0-no fluorescence<br>
5-high fluorescence

Competent cells, fluorescein: 5 <br>
Competent cells, m9: 2.5<br>
Competent cells, oligo: 1

Overnight cells, fluorescein: 1<br>
Overnight cells, m9: 1<br>
Overnight cells, oligo: 2

Should I post pics online?

2. <b>Effects of Various Fluorescein Concentrations</b> on MC4100 Overnight Culture Experiment

a) FACS: Fluorescence increased w/increasing conc for the most part.  Should I get help for more detailed analysis?<br>
b) plating results:

control:   5.2 X 10^8 cells/ml<br>
5M:        4.5 X 10^8 cells/ml<br>
500mM:     4.7 X 10^8 cells/ml<br>
50mM:      1.60 X 10^9 cells/ml<br>
5mM:       7.3 X 10^8 cells/ml<br>
500microM: 1.26 X 10^9 cells/ml<br>
50microM:  1.03 X 10^9 cells/ml<br>
5microM:   3.2 X 10^8 cells/ml

===Receiver Head-Unit: Jenny===
 '''Progress: scFv Testing'''
 [[Image:Check.gif]] Materials (most?) for western blot.
 [[Image:Check.gif]] Promoter.RBS biobrick BBa_J13002.
 [[Image:Pending.gif]] Primer start-codon for scFv
 '''Progress: ToxR Unit'''
 [[Image:Check.gif]] scFv.TT Biobricked. BBa_J07043, 44, 45.

===Receiver/Transmitter 1 - ToxR : Wiki-Will===
Progress:
*assembling ctx-promotor (J07007) :: gfp composite.
**transform failed --> plate showed no growth this morning. 
**i'd like to think we'll get this piece working this weekend.

Problems: 
*waiting on ToxR (drew, how about your "i can assemble it in a week, wait forget i said that." i don't want to forget.)


 *want to review the system?
 http://openwetware.org/index.php?title=Image:SystemToxRpathway.jpg
 [[Image:Check.gif]] scFv, with terminator
 [[Image:Check.gif]] malE , negative control
 [[Image:Pending.gif]] PhoA, positive control. Ready, but still must remove restriction site with quikchange (Hi Annie!)
 [[Image:Pending.gif]] fusion of scFv, malE, and PhoA to ToxR. (for obvious reasons)
 _
 [[Image:Check.gif]] have constitutive promotor :: rbs part
 [[Image:Pending.gif]] fusion to ToxR ...
 _
 [[Image:Pending.gif]] ctx promotor :: gfp ***almost done***

===Receiver/Transmitter 2 - FecA : Annie===
*Progress: 
 -Worked out details of all building processes [[../../Annie's Notes/]]
 -Specified more parts [http://parts2.mit.edu/r/parts/partsdb/pgroup.cgi?pgroup=iGEM&group=iGEM_MIT J07046-J07063] composite parts for FecA system 
 -Base parts made: FecA, FecI, FecR, attempted FecA'
 -Base parts plan to make next week: FecA', FecR', FecA Promoter, 
 -Assembling: rbs with FecI and FecR, rbs with promoter 
 -Have overnight culture and a plate of DY329, ready for making FecA- and Fur-
*Problems:
 -2 of 5 primers for adding linker to scFv are wrong. Add a different aa sequence
  5'RVARAVTTRSRISTRSRSG 3' instead of 5'PNSASHSGSAPNTSSAPGS 3'
 -Primers for fusion are wrong. If we go with the accidentally-created linker, we can use half
  of the already ordered primers --> reorder the other half.  
*Solutions:
 -reorder

===Signal Processor: Ray===
*Waiting on parts from registry to do own assembly

===Actuator===
*Have begun using E0840 (rbs:gfp:TT) in conjunction with other systems


==Issues/Discussion==
#Input: having trouble with repeatable results
#Do we know that our input molecules are what we think they are?
#To look at experiment reproducibility, be consistent!
#Still waiting for ToxR -- Can I call?
#Sequencing: get info from biopolymer -- need plasmid DNA and primers
#*Everything we've assembled, get sequenced!!
