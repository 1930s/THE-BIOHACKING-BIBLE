There is really no good tool for this yet that I know of. I've tried some but never really found what I wanted, two or more sequences with features plotted on them or display something like a synteny-plot:
** [http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Alfresco/ Alfresco]
** ACT
** self-written tools that operate in text-mode (ugly, e.g. emboss' prettyseq)
** Apollo (also in synteny mode)
** Vector NTI in aligment mode ("Show all features")
** My MUMU-tools (export to svg)
** gff2ps (only one sequence?)
** Multipipmaker and Vista, when in doubt use multipipmaker, Vista comes almost without any documentation and uses a strange "plotfile" format
** feature_draw from bioperl (though only for one sequence at a time, very configurable)
** [http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/argo/help/comparative.html Argo] whole genome viewer/editor, with comparative view
