''BE.180 Homework Assignment #4 - Due on Tuesday, April 25 at 5pm''

*Download Assignment 4: [[Media:PSETfour_final.pdf]]
*You will need these three input files:
**Dictionary with the genetic code: [[Media:GeneticCode.dict]]
**Text file with protein sequence: [[Media:Protein.txt]]
**Text file with genome:  [[Media:NC_003418.txt]]
***When saving these files, make sure the file names are uppercase.

Submit your one Python file to: be180hw@gmail.com.  Please do not send anything other than this file to the gmail account (all questions can be sent to spencers@mit.edu or sontag@mit.edu).  Please note that we will be posting the solutions to this assignment at 5pm on April 25, and we will not accept any homework after that time.

===Corrections to problem set===
*The sentence on page one should read "If the first positions of all codons encoding an amino acid are the same, write that nucleotideâ€™s letter to the mRNA string (i.e., A, C, U, G)", not (A, C, T, G)!
*From a student: "I was wondering if you could help me with the decoding rules for problem 1. I don't know if I'm interpreting them wrong, but why does it seem like the rules don't cover all possible cases?  Such as for arginine, which can only be A/C in the first position, and serine, which can only be C/G in the second position.  Are we supposed to assign these nucleotides with H and N respectively, even if substituting U in arginine and A/U in serine will result in a different amino acid codon?"  
**Yes, there was an oversight in the rule-making.  However, please still follow the rules outlined in the pdf for the purposes of this assignment.  We will not test your code with a protein containing arginine or serine.

*The code was graded using a Protein.txt input file containing the protein "LAND" and a NC_003418.txt file containing the genome "AAAACCCCGGGGTTT".  
*The correct outputs are RT=YUNGCNAAYGAY, bestScore=0, listOfBestMers= ['GTTTAAAA', 'TTTTAAAA', 'GTTTTAAA', 'TTTTTAAA'].  
*Point breakdown: Q1: 25 points, Q2a: 10 points, Q2b: 15 points, Q2c: 25 points, Q3: 25 points 
*Sample point deductions:
**-5 for RT being incorrect, but close
**-5 for not getting the 4 mers in listOfBestMers but getting some of them, or for finding a few too many, with the correct ones being part of the list
**-10 for being even further off on the listOfBestMers, for example finding 1120 instead of 4, or not finding any that are correct
**-5 for getting bestScore wrong
**-5 total for naming variables incorrectly
