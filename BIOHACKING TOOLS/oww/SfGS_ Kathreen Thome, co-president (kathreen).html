I'm currently a junior in Nuclear Science and Engineering, intending to continue on to graduate school to receive my doctorate. I've been interested in energy and environmental issues, particularly the current oil crisis, ever since I was very young. I see nuclear fusion as one possible way to help resolve this problem, and plan to conduct fusion research after I graduate. I like to educate people (hopefully taking away their misconceptions) about nuclear energy sources, energy sources, and how their actions affect the environment. I'd love to write children's books and easy to read books about energy for people to learn more about nuclear energy, energy in general, and just what they are doing to this beautiful planet! I'm also a Pledge Ambassador, because that encompasses the lifestyle that I want to live.
