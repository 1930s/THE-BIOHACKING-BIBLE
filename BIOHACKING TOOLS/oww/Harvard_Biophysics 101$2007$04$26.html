'''Plans'''
* Xiaodi: [[Harvard:Biophysics_101/2007/Notebook:Xiaodi_Wu/2007-5-1|An account]] of the developments on the new server thus far; then, furthermore [[Harvard:Biophysics_101/2007/Notebook:Xiaodi_Wu/2007-5-3|a proposal, request, and random thought]] for the class, basically outlining what I plan to work on over the next week or so
* Tiff: [[TChan/Notebook/2007-4-30|[X](1) Organize Project page, [X](2) Look into medical site clickthrus/disclaimers, [X](3) Look at licensing options,]] [[TChan/Notebook/2007-5-3|[ ](4) Write code from '''input''': (number) rs# --GeneCards--> '''output''': (number) allelic frequency, [ ] (5) Present something]]
*Resmi:  [[Harvard:Biophysics_101/2007/Notebook:Resmi_Charalel/2007-5-1|Update]] of what I have done so far and plan to do this coming week.  Also, I find this project very interesting and would love to contribute to continue to contribute to this project. So, please let me know what else I can help with!
*[[Harvard:Biophysics_101/2007/Notebook:CChi/2007-4-29|Cynthia]]: Working code for getting mesh terms from PMIDs (modify/fix Resmi's)!  Rs#->pubmed articles->mesh terms(->prevalence)
*[[Harvard:Biophysics_101/Notebook:ZS/2007-4-30 |Zach]]: Compile code I have written / generalize my BLAST script from earlier / help with other tasks
*[[Harvard:Biophysics_101/2007/Notebook:Christopher_Nabel/2007-4-30|Chris]]: Revise XML parse to yield a dict class, not a list.  Write my half of the false-positive code.  Document the rest of my code for Katie.  Try to figure out how we could apply quality control to hits identified by Zach's code
*[[Harvard:Biophysics_101/2007/Notebook:Denizkural/2007-4-30|Deniz]]: Sharpen the mapping between terms through pubmed and condition/disease, and integrate the news/feed scripts.
*[[Harvard:Biophysics_101/2007/Notebook:HRH/2007-5-1|Hetmann]]: Work with eMedicine.
