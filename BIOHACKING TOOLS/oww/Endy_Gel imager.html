==Problems/Fixes==
In general the machine has been very good to us through high usage.  Here are some comments with things going wrong.  

#The computer that came with the machine had a motherboard failure of sometype.  We were sent a new one.  It has been working great since.  
#The white light table initially had problems with fraying of the wire feeding it power.  This was occuring because the wire was getting caught when we were pulling out the table.  We fixed it by splicing in a new cable (sent to us by syngene), therefore extending the power cord and reducing stress on the wire.
