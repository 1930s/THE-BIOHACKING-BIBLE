==Experimental==

*'''target organism''': bacteria, mammalian cells
*'''stock solution''': 10mg/ml in water
*'''working solution''': 10-50Âµg/ml (stable at RT for 5days)

==Description==

*'''mode of action''': binds to ribosomal components and inhibits protein synthesis.
*'''mode of resistance''': ''neo/kan'' resistance gene is an aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase, which inactivates [[G418]], neomycin, and [[kanamycin]] by phosphorylation.
