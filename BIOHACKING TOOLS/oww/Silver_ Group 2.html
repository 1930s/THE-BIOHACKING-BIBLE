Summary of things to think about:

- review ways to monitor RNAs bound to particular proteins

- ways to determine alternative splicing profiles at a whole genome level

- caution on Odyssey machine


From today's (Nov 14) meeting:

- genome wide alternative splicing analysis is progressing

- the fish are coming!!

- can chip reveal targets for alternative splicing factor in neurons

-  stilll thinking about how to profile bound RNAs -if anyone out there knows of good ways to crosslink proteins and RNA that are reversible and don't destroy the RNA - please let us know!
