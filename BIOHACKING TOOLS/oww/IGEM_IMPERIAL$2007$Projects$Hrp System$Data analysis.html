==Data Analysis==
The raw data from the two test constructs is absorbance and fluorescence at varying time intervals. We want to convert this raw data into rate of GFP synthesis per cell.
To carry out this conversion the [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Projects/Hrp_System/Calibration| Calibration Curves]] are used.
For each concentration of inducer the absorbance into colony forming units (cfu) and fluorescence into the rate of GFP molecules synthesised sec<sup>-1</sup>.
The final units are '''GFP molecules synthesised cfu <sup>-1</sup> sec<sup>-1</sup>''' .
====Test Construct Promoter====
The data collected will the absorbance and fluorescence measured of a series of cultures exposed to different concentrations of inducer.
The data collected for each culture can be displayed in:
#<font color=green>'''Fluorescence vs Time'''</font>
#<font color=green>'''Absorbance vs Time'''</font>

Then using the calibration curve these two graphs can be converted into:

|| || |||| || |||| || ||align="center"|<font color=green>'''  Colony Forming Units vs Time''' </font>

|}

From these two graphs the following information can be derived:
The rate of '''GFP molecules synthesised sec<sup>-1</sup>''' from measuring the gradient of the <font color=green>''''Intracellular [GFP] molecules vs Time''''</font> for a particular time point.

The '''GFP molecules synthesised sec<sup>-1</sup>''' can then be converted into the final units by dividing by the CFU, this will give the final units of '''GFP molecules synthesised cfu <sup>-1</sup> sec<sup>-1</sup>'''.

The final result will be:
<font color=green>''''GFP molecules synthesised cfu <sup>-1</sup> sec<sup>-1</sup> vs Time''''</font> for a series of inducer concentrations.
These concentrations can be displayed relative to each other on a 3D graph:
<font color=green>''''GFP molecules synthesised cfu <sup>-1</sup> sec<sup>-1</sup> vs Inducer Concentration vs time''''</font>

====Test Construct Device====
The data collected for this test construct will be the same as that for the first test construct, the difference being in that in this test construct we are measuring the output of '''GFP molecules synthesised cfu <sup>-1</sup> sec<sup>-1</sup>''' from our device.
The same conversions described for 'test construct promoter' are applied.
The result will be:
<font color=green>''''GFP molecules synthesised cfu <sup>-1</sup> sec<sup>-1</sup> vs Time''''</font> for a series of inducer concentrations.
These concentrations can be displayed relative to each other on a 3D graph:
<font color=green>''''GFP molecules synthesised cfu <sup>-1</sup> sec<sup>-1</sup> vs Inducer Concentration vs time''''</font>

===Combining Data===
The data collected from each construct can be combined to give us the expected inputs and outputs of our device. This is because:
#Test Construct Promoter experiments measured the'''GFP molecules synthesised cfu <sup>-1</sup> sec<sup>-1</sup>''' into our device.
#Test Construct Device measured the '''GFP molecules synthesised cfu <sup>-1</sup> sec<sup>-1</sup>''' output in response to the various inputs.
The data can be combined so that a 3D graph can be plotted of:
<font color=green>''''GFP molecules synthesised IN vs GFP molecules synthesised OUT vs time''''</font>
