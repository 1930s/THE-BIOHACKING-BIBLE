=== Quotes ===

Make software that you want to use and that you would want to use often. As long as you are making something that you want to use, then your heart will be in it.
:Cabel Sasser, 2006


All programmers are playwrights and all computers are lousy actors.
:Unknown


Where a calculator on the ENIAC is equipped with 18,000 vacuum tubes and weighs 30 tons, computers in the future may have only 1,000 vaccuum tubes and perhaps weigh 1.5 tons.
:unknown, 1949


To err is human--and to blame it on a computer is even more so.
:Robert Orben


I think computer viruses should count as life. I think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. We've created life in our own image.
:Stephen Hawking
