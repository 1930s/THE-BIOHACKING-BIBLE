==Testing a new RBS-ribosome pair==
I'm going to construct a new mutant 16srRNA.  I'm going to try two of the sequences published by Chin and Rackham<cite>Rackham</cite>.  I'm picking two of the mutants that don't require me to mutate the distant bases that the authors also mutate.

===Orthogonal ribosome construction===
I'm going to make this via [['Round-the-horn site-directed mutagenesis]].  This seems like the quickest way to make the full 5 base mutation in one go.

====Primer design====
pCH1497-ASD1      5'-CacaCTTAccttaaagaagcgtactttgtagtgctcacacag attgtctgatagaaagtga-3'<br>
4rRNA-f primer    5'-TTGTGGTAccttaaagaagcgtactttgtagtgctcacacag-3'  Tm = 61.8C<br>
10rRNA-f primer   5'-TGGGATTAccttaaagaagcgtactttgtagtgctcacacag-3'  Tm = 61.9C<br>
4/10rRNA-r primer 5'-TGATCCAACCGCAGGTTCCCCTAC-3'  Tm = 62.8C<br>

*My plasmid is 10kB so [[Sean Moore]] suggested adding fresh polymerase in half-way through.  I didn't actually manage to do that on the first attempt.
*[[Sean Moore|Sean]] also suggested dropping the melting temperature by a few degrees and also the extension temperature.  I did 91C for melting and 69C for extension.  
*I used [[Pfu Ultra]] and [[Phusion]] as my polymerases.
*According to the gel I ran of the PCR product (I ran 10&mu;l), phusion worked(?) but pfu ultra did not.  Not sure yet why the phusion lanes are smeary.  I think I'll redo this and try to add in the fresh polymerase this time.
*Not sure why the PCR product of 10rRNA looks slightly longer than 4rRNA.  Maybe just because there is more DNA?
*I did a 10&mu;l ligation rather than the 5 that [[Sean Moore|Sean]] recommends.
*Got ~50 colonies on each plate of BL21(DE3) with a wide range of sizes(?).  I PCR'd 3 big and 3 small on each plate.  Only got the right band from the small colonies, not sure why.
*Will start cultures of 4-6 and 10-4, 10-5 and 10-6.
*Sequencing says that 4-6 worked, although it mutated an A to a G just upstream of the ASD.  I'll test this anyway to see if it works.  I should also check to see if this mutation is due to an error in my reverse primer as it would have been in this region.
*I got no sequence results for 10-6 and 10-5 seems to have had the ASD cut out.  I'll try re-prepping 10-6 and see how that sequences.
*From the second gel, start cultures of lanes 3, 6, 11 and 12.
*Colonies 10-1 and 4-2 sequenced correctly. nice.
*In addition, I'm keeping 10-5 from the first sequencing since it has the ASD deleted and 4-5 from the second sequencing as it has a slightly different ASD than expected.

===Reporter Devices===
I designed six new reporter devices for dedicated translation and six new reporter devices for dedicated transcription and translation.
I checked for - 
*random start codons
*BB restriction sites
*cryptic SD sequences
*secondary structure

More later.
