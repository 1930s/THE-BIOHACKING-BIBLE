==To Do==
#Add new devices into the Registry
#Check re-plating of devices A and C (done. no growth.)
#Create/order primers for device B
#Mini-prep and sequence device B culture (colony 8) and Jason's three cultures (done)

==Mini-Prep==
*Spun at 5k for 4.5 min before prepping
*note: accidentally added 250 of P1 to each tube instead of each culture, but reconsolidated into four miniprep columns. We'll see if this affects the results drastically.
*Eluted with 30ÂµL of EB.
*For future reference: when sequencing, should elute with aqueous NaOH solution of pH 8.5
**Will probably need to re-do this...

=="Device B" Primers==
*Fwd
**CTTAGTAG + CAATTG + tccctatcagtgatagagattgacatc
*Rev
**TCAGCGAT + ATGCAT + TATAAACGCAGAAAGGCCCAC
