This is tutorial (in development) for getting started on the microscope.

== How to sign up for the scope==

*We have a Google calendar for scope usage:

==How to turn on the scope==
(order doesn't matter)
#Turn on FL lamp
#*takes 2 minutes to warm up
#*takes 30 minutes to cool down (so don't start again in <30 min)
#Turn on transmitted light lamp
#Turn on scope (switch is on back left of the base)
#Turn on Ludl Box (controls shutters)
#Turn on camera

==How do I find my cells?==


If this doesn't work then you may need to [[Focusing the Nikon TE2000 Condenser|focus the condenser]], this is a little tricky so you should be shown how to do it by [[Jason Kelly|jason]] first.

==Common Problems==

===I don't see anything in the eyepiece===
#The optical path is not pointing to the eyepiece, you can change it on the control pad. 


===The fine focus knob doesn't move the turret===
Two possible problems:
#(more likely) You have turned on the fine focus knob which is seperate from the base.  Only one can control the turret at a given time, turn off the satellite knob.
#The z-stage is too low (<0 position as read from control pad) or too high (>6000? need to check this.).  Turn the scope off and on and you should be OK.
