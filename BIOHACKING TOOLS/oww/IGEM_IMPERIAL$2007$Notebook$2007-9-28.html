==Optimum DNA concentration==
*Aim today was to get the optimum DNA concentration for the pTet-GFP and the pTet-lixR-pLux-GFP construct. The protocols can be found [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Wet_Lab/Protocols/Prot1.8| Here]]
*The constructs were tested for 0, 1, 2, 4 and 6ug of DNA.
*The fluorescence over a period of 6 hours was recorded every hour for all the concentrations.
*It was found that at 25&deg;C pTet-lixR-pLux-GFP behaves as expected, i.e. the optimum output is for a mass between 2 and 4ug of DNA. The results can be foud [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/new pages/DNA concentrations|here]]
*For pTet-GFP construct, at 37&deg;C, the fluorecence was highest at the end of the day for 6ug of DNA. 
*The optimum DNA concentration that was tested is between 2-6µg of DNA, however the difference between 2µg,4µg,6µg is negligible. The results can be foung [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/new pages/DNA concentrations2|here]]
