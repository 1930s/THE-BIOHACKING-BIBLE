===Information for Prospective Students===

We appreciate your interest in MIT's 2004 IAP Synthetic Biology Lab. The theme this year is to design genetically encoded systems that  make use of cell-cell signaling and cell-based logic to create polka-dot (or other) patterns  in bacterial lawns. The course has no pre-requisites but requires "heavy-lifting" from all participants. Work includes, but is not limited to, literature scouring, database querying, DNA editing, and genetic device and system design, modeling, and simulation. The work is performed in groups; last-year's groups contained a good-mix of expertise (i.e., no one person had to learn/do everything). Enrollment is limited as it is the second time the course has been taught and we have finite resources for system fabrication and assembly. To apply please send a brief email to the instructors. There are no prerequisites or requirements; last year's participants ranged from first-year undergraduates to postdoctoral researchers. We expect to notify participants by December 8, 2003.

===Frequently Asked Questions===

# '''I won't be here &lt;any random day/week&gt; in January, can I still take the class?''' It depends. A random day here/there shouldn't be a problem (but you will need to coordinate with your group once the course starts).
# '''Can I sit in on the lectures?''' No, we do not allow  for listeners (space, et cetera).
# '''How much time will the course require?''' ~2 hours per weekday for   lecture and group discussions (lunch is provided). You should plan to spend an additional 1-6 hours per day to work on your project.
# '''Will I be doing experiments? Will I gain &quot;wet-lab&quot; experience? What will I be doing?''' The course is purposefully designed to avoid requiring any wet-lab experiments. Instead students (and instructors) first work to specify DNA encoding genetic devices. Once the newly specified DNA has been ordered the class shifts gears to work on the conception, design and specification of integrated biological systems. By analogy, the designer of a complex integrated electronic circuit does not typically also build the silicon chip. However, if you are a class participant and have extra time each morning, we  may be able to arrange  an  experience &quot;bashing&quot; DNA (please indicate such an interest in your application).
# '''You made &quot;blinkers&quot; last IAP, did anything blink?''' ''Short answer'': we are still building the systems but are closing in on completion. ''Long answer (copied from a report)'': During January, 2003 we conducted a four-week long experimental course in which 16 students were asked to design genetically-encoded oscillators using protein-DNA logic (PDL); students were given a 20,000 base pair DNA synthesis budget. In addition, students were asked to design their systems using standard biological parts such that the resulting parts could be used in more than one system (i.e, parts were shared across the class). The course workflow was:  (i) model-based system design, (ii) model-driven simulation, (iii) layout,  documentation, and plan of characterization, (iv) parts ordering via commercial  suppliers, and (v) parts return and system assembly. Design, simulation, layout  and documentation took one month. Editing the student-specified parts and placing  the parts synthesis order took two months. Parts synthesis required another one to five months. System assembly from standard parts is taking an additional four months, for a total elapsed time of one year. Current estimates are that the 2004 course will run to completion in five months and that, given current technology, three months start-finish will be realized.
