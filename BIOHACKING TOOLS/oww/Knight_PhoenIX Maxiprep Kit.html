*[http://www.qbiogene.com/products/phoenix/ph_maxiprep.shtml PhoenIX™ Maxiprep Kit]
*Isopropanol
*70% Ethanol
*[[Knight:5810R centrifuge]]

==When using a new kit==
#Assemble cardboard column rack.
#Note that the resuspension, lysis and neutralization buffer bottles are VERY hard to open.

==Procedure==
See [http://www.qbiogene.com/technical/protocols/Phoenix/PhoenIX%20maxi%20kit.pdf official protocol].  The steps below have been changed to accommodate our tubes and centrifuge.

#Place PhoenIX™ Maxi column in the assembled column rack. 
#Place a beaker underneath to collect flow through.
#Add 30 ml of equilibration buffer (gray cap label) to the surface of the column and allow the liquid to drain by gravity flow.
#*''Note: It will take 15-20 minutes for the column to drain completely.''
#Pellet 200 ml of bacterial culture by centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 20 minutes at 4&deg;C.
#Remove all traces of liquid medium from the bacterial cell pellet by pouring.
#*''Trace media can affect subsequent steps.''
#Add 10 ml of RNase A-containing cell resuspension buffer (yellow cap label) to the cell pellet and vortex until completely resuspended.
#*There is some resuspension buffer with RNase A added stored at 4&deg;C in 32-306.  To make more, you'll need to add RNase A to more resuspension buffer.  The resuspension buffer (without RNase A) is in the box and the RNase A is stored at -20&deg;C on the door.
#Transfer resuspended cells to 50 mL conical tube.
#Add 10 ml of Lysis Buffer (blue cap label) and securely cap the tube. 
#Mix thoroughly by inverting until the lysate appears to be homogeneous (5-6 inversions). DO NOT VORTEX.
#Incubate 5 minutes at room temperature.
#*''Note: Do not incubate for longer than 5 minutes or plasmid DNA might become irreversibly denatured.''
#Add 10 ml of neutralization buffer (green cap label). 
#Securely cap the tube and mix immediately by multiple inversions until a homogeneous suspension containing no viscous matter is obtained. DO NOT VORTEX.
#*''Note: If preparing several samples at once, thoroughly mix each sample immediately after the addition of the neutralization buffer before adding the buffer to the next tube.''
#Centrifuge at 9,000 x g for 20 mins at room temperature.
#*''Note: The supernatant must at room temperature (18 – 25&deg;C) prior to loading on the column.''
#Verify that the qquilibration buffer has been collected in the beaker. 
#Discard the flow-through and replace the container.
#Use a pipette to remove the cleared lysate supernatant from the centrifuged sample and add to the top of the equilibrated column.
#*''Note: Do not pour lysate directly onto the column. Use a pipette to ensure that precipitate particles do not enter the column and cause clogging.''
#Allow the lysate to drain by gravity flow (10-15 minutes). 
#Discard the flowthrough and replace the empty container.
#Add 30 ml of column wash buffer (orange cap label) to the top of the column and allow the liquid to drain by gravity flow (10 minutes).
#Add 30 ml of column wash buffer (orange cap label) to the top of the column and allow the liquid to drain by gravity flow (10 minutes).
#Discard the flow-through. 
#Replace the waste collection container with a 50 mL conical tube.
#Add 15 ml of elution buffer (pink cap label) to the top of the column.
#Allow the eluate to drain by gravity flow (5-10 minutes) into the centrifuge tube.
#Add 10.5 ml of room temperature isopropanol to the eluted plasmid DNA in the centrifuge tube. 
#Mix and centrifuge at 9,000 x g for 40 minutes at 4&deg;C.
#Pour out the supernatant taking care not to disturb the DNA pellet.
#Add 5 ml of room temperature 70% ethanol and wash the pellet.
#Centrifuge at 9,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4&deg;C.
#Completely remove ALL of the supernatant from the pellet with a pipette.
#Air-dry the pellet for 10 minutes.
#*''Note: Drying with a vacuum chamber is not recommended because over-dried DNA may be difficult to completely resuspend.''
#Dissolve the plasmid DNA in 500 &mu;l of water. 
#Move to smaller tube.
#Take a spectrophotometer reading to assess concentration.

==Notes==
*These spin steps may not be hard enough.  Most of the purification steps are supposed to be at 12,000 x g.
*You're not supposed to let the column stand between steps.
