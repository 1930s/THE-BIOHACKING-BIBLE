#Add 500mL 1X TAE to a 1L conical flask.  <br>''1X TAE can be found in 564D above the sink.  See [[Sriram Kosuri|Sri]] if it is empty.''
#Due to our usage rate it makes sense to prepare 2-3 of these at a time.
#Measure out 5 g of Agarose (not low melting point Agarose or Agar).  <br>''Agarose is on the chemicals shelf outside 558D.''
#Add the Agarose to the TAE buffer and swirl to mix.
#Microwave flask on high until the gel starts to bubble and is transparent.  
#*''8 mins at 100% with some shaking after 3mins seems to be perfect for two flasks in the Endy/Sauer microwave''
#*'''Never put aluminium foil in the microwave!'''
#Label and store in the Peltier incubator in 564D.
