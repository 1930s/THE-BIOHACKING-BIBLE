==06/12/06 Repeat (from 6/09/06) Transformation Lab==



===Sources===
*Note, used 1/2 of designated source 
#SAMT in PET28 1.6 &mu;g
#BAMT in PET28 2.0 &mu;g
#BSMT in PET28 2.0 &mu;g

===Dehydrated DNA Recovery (from paper)===
*Final DNA Concentration: 1ng/&mu;L (room for better quantification)

#Add appropriate amount of TE buffer to 1.7mL Eppendorf tubes (500&mu;L for BAMT and BSMT; 400&mu;L for SAMT).
#Carefully cut out paper that contains DNA and place into Eppen.
#*Ensure submergence with toothpick 
#*Wait for 10 minutes

===Transformation===
#Followed chemical transformation protocol listed [[Transforming chemically competent cells | here]].
#*Cell Types Transformed:
#**DH5&alpha (big clear tubes with green tape);, Top 10 (Invitrogen) (purple caps), Top 10 (Tom) (big clear tubes), BL21 (Invitrogen) (greenish brown caps)
#*Used 2&mu;L of plasmid/DNA.
#*Heat shocked the BL21(DL3) cells
#**42 c for 50 seconds
#*Used 500&mu;L 2xYT media for DH5&alpha cells
#*Used 500&mu;L S.O.C. media for other 3 cells
#*horizontal shaking for 60 minutes
#*Plated 200&mu;L cells

====Notes====
#Invitrogen Top 10 BSMT tube fell.  It was put on the microfuge for a second to get the cells off the side of the tube.
#For TOP10 cells use this [https://catalog.invitrogen.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=iProtocol.unitSectionTree&objectId=E62FEAF0F3C8B0E215833D3E8A49BD5D&treeNodeId=289731BD016F54BEBFEAA20F29AA1796 transformation protocol], which is similar but slightly different from the what we did [[Transforming chemically competent cells | previously]]

==Updates on Research in Biosynthetic Pathways for Acid Production==
#I emailed out the two referenced papers on this pathway: CA-->BA-->SA
#Unfortunately, it seems that the gene's sequence encoding the enzyme responsible (benzoic acid 2-hydroxylase) for catalyzing the BA-->SA reaction is not in Pubmed.  It seems that the last paper written on the enzyme was in 2000 and did not seem to have any information on sequence information.
#Here is a piece from a paper that seems to explan the CA-->BA reaction.  "Our results revealed the metabolic pathway that leads from l-phenylalanine to the major aryl metabolites produced by B. adusta. The presence of 13C-labelled trans-cinnamic acid together with PAL activity shows that trans-cinnamic acid is a key pathway intermediate. In addition, trans-cinnamic acid is an efficient precursor of benzoic acid, benzyl alcohol, and benzaldehyde. trans-Cinnamic acid can be subsequently hydroxylated to β-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid (Fig. 2, pathway 2), which in turn can be converted via a β-oxidation step to benzoic acid. This was confirmed by the presence of acetophenone as a degradation product of β-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid. Furthermore, trans-cinnamic acid is the precursor that is most efficiently converted to benzoic acid among the putative precursors which we tested. This confirms that there is a β-oxidation process in B. adusta and that benzoic acid is the major product of this process. β-Oxidation has been found previously in several other fungi (13), although apparently not in B. adusta. To our knowledge, this is the first time that β-oxidation of this nature has been found in a white rot fungus." http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=92016
