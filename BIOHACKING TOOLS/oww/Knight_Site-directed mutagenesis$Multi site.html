''Back to [[Site-directed mutagenesis]]''

Work in progress!

This protocol permits mutation at multiple sites simultaneously with only a single oligo per site.

==Materials==
*Template plasmid purified from a dam<sup>+</sup> ''E. coli'' strain (not JM110 or SCS110)
*Mutatagenesis primers (one per mutation, each on the same strand)
*[http://www.stratagene.com/products/showProduct.aspx?pid=105 ''PfuTurbo'' DNA polymerase] (nonstrand-displacing) and associated reaction buffer
*[http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/productM0208.asp Taq ligase]
*dNTPs
*ATP
*PCR Thermocycler
*[http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/productR0176.asp Dpn I]
*Competent cells
*unphosphorylated primers (1 for each mutation)

==Mutagenesis PCR mix==
25&mu;L total reaction volume:
*2.5 &mu;L of 10X Taq ligase buffer (need the NAD for Taq ligase)
*0.5 &mu;L 100mM ATP
*1 &mu;L 25mM each dNTP
*X &mu;L (50-100 ng) of dsDNA template
*X &mu;L of each oligonucleotide primer
**For 1-3 primers, add 100 ng each primer.  For 4-5 primers, add 50 ng each primer.
**If primers are greater than 20% different in length, scale the amount of primer added so that primer is added in approximately equimolar amounts.  See [http://www.stratagene.com/manuals/200518.pdf Stratagene QuikChange Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis manual] for details.
**Austin uses 0.1&mu;L of 40&mu;M primer (each one).
*1 &mu;L of dNTP mix (100mM total dNTP mix with 25 mM each individual dNTP)
*ddH<sub>2</sub>O to a final volume of 22 &mu;L
Then add
*1 &mu;L of PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (2.5 U/&mu;L)
*1 &mu;L of Taq Ligase
*1 &mu;L of T4 PNK

==Procedure==
This procedure is primarily derived from the [http://www.stratagene.com/manuals/200518.pdf Stratagene QuikChange Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis manual] with some modifications based on past experience.

#Design mutagenesis primers.  
#*The primer should be designed so that the desired mutation occurs at the exact center of the primer with 10-15 bp of matching sequence on each side.
#*Primers should be 25-45bp in length with a melting temp of >=75&deg;C.  Stratagene recommends not using primers greater than 45 bp in order to avoid formation of secondary structure.  Primers should have comparable melting temperatures.
#*See the [http://www.stratagene.com/manuals/200514.pdf Stratagene manual] for more detailed information.  In particular, adhere to their formula for calculating the melting temperature of your primers and design your primers to have a melting temperature >=75&deg;C.
#*Primers should have at least 40% GC content and terminate in one or more C or G bases at the 3' end.
#*PAGE purification of primers may improve mutagenesis efficiency.  See [[Designing primers#Oligo synthesis information | here]] for links to information on oligo purification.
#*See [[Designing primers | designing primers]] for general advice on primer design.
#Purify template plasmid from a dam<sup>+</sup> ''E. coli'' strain via [[Miniprep | miniprep]].
#Set up mutagenesis PCR mix as described above.
#Run Reaction
##37&deg;C for 30 min (T4 PNK step)
##95&deg;C for 3 min
##95&deg;C for 1 min
##55&deg;C for 1 min
##65&deg;C for 2 min/kb of plasmid length minimum (is [http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/faqproductM0208.asp#361 optimal] temperature for Taq ligase)
##Run reaction for 30 cycles.
#*Stratagene recommends using a PCR machine with heated lid or overlaying the reaction with mineral oil.
#Cool the reaction to <=37&deg;C
#Add 1&mu;L DpnI restriction enzyme to the PCR tube directly.  (Purification is not necessary at this stage).
#Incubate 6 hours at 37&deg;C (even though the Stratagene manual only recommends 1 hr).
#Purify PCR product (not necessary, Austin transforms 3 &mu;l directly).  
#*I typically do this step using a [http://www1.qiagen.com/literature/handbooks/PDF/DNACleanupAndConcentration/QQ_Spin/1021422_HBQQSpin_072002WW.pdf QIAgen PCR Purification kit] but any purification which removes the salts, dNTPs, oligos and proteins from the PCR should be fine.
#[[Knight:Electroporation | Transform]] purified DNA into highly competent cells.
#Screen the transformants for the desired mutation using [[Colony PCR  | colony PCR]], [[Restriction Digest | restriction digest]] or [[Sequencing DNA | sequencing]] as appropriate.

==Notes==
*Stratagene does not recommend this protocol for insertions or deletions.
*Apparently there are no primer spacing-dependent effects on mutagenesis efficiency (primers can be adjacent or far apart).
*You can also phosphorylate the primers separately from the rest of the mutagenesis reaction
