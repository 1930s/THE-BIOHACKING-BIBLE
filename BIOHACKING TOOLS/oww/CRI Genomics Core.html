{{CRI Genomics Core navigation bar}}

==General==

We are located in the new [http://science.cancerresearchuk.org/cri/ Cancer Research UK: Cambridge Research Institute]. The Genomics Core in the CRI will offer nucleic acid preparation, sequencing, real-time PCR and microarray hybridisation services for CRI researchers. 
These core services allow CRI researchers to concentrate on data analysis, rather than the generation of genomic data.
