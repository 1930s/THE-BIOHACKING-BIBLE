==Digests==
*[http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/tech_reference/restriction_enzymes/timesaver_enzymes.asp NEB] says 5 minutes for most of its enzymes. 
**If you're gel-purifying out an insert, 5-10 minutes seems to be sufficient. If you want to be more certain (if you need the vector, for example, and the insert is too small to distinguish singly from doubly cut), a hour or two seems fine ([[User:Jkm|Jkm]])


==Ligations==
*NEB says 5 minutes for its [http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/productM2200.asp quick ligase] and 10 minutes for its [http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/productM0202.asp standard ligase]. 
**30 minutes is more than sufficient ([[User:Jkm|Jkm]])
