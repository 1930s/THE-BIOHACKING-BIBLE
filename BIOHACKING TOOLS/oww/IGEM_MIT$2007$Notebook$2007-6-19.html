==To-do List==
#Sequence surface expression of sticky protein (code it as passenger protein of CPX)
#More research

==Rough Layout of surface sticky protein==

*Notes:
**Do we need a tag?
**Need a ribosome binding site?
***No.  We will be adding an RBS/promotor sequence when we couple the sticky protein.  For now just order the sequence without
**Do we need restriction sites other than the embedded ones?
**Still need to find Mgfp-151 sequence
**What is the standard BioBrick depiction of gene parts?
