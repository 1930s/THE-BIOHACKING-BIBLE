==Mode of Action==
Chloramphenicol is a bacteriostatic agent that binds to the 50S ribosomal subunit and inhibits ribosomal peptide bond formation.  It is sometimes used as a way of "amplifying" plasmid production by shutting down protein synthesis in cultures, while allowing plasmid replication to continue.

==Working Concentrations and Stock Solutions==
High copy plasmids allow 35 &mu;g/ml concentration. Stock solutions can be made at 35 mg/ml in ethanol, kept at -20C.

==Resistance Gene==
The ''cat'' gene codes for an acetyltransferase which acetylates chloramphenicol, inactivating it.
The gene is sometimes specifed as ''Cm<sup>R</sup>'' or ''Cam<sup>R</sup>''.
