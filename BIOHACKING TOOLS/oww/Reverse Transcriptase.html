==Characteristics of RT==
#RNA dependent, DNA polymerase
#Requires a suitable primer
#*Sequence specific
#*Random hexamers
#*Poly-U (in Eukaryotes)
#Two functional domains:
#*DNA polymerase
#*RNase H
#Naturally occuring in RNA viruses:
#*AMV = Avian Myeloblastosis Virus
#*Mo-MLV = Moloney strain Murine Leukemia Virus
#*HIV
#*Most commercial RTs are either AMV or Mo-MLV derivatives

==AMV vs. Mo-MLV==
::{| border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"
|-
! Mo-MLV || AMV
|-
| Single polypeptide chain || 2 polypeptide chains 
|-
| 2 independently functioning, non-overlapping domains 
Amino terminal (450 aa) = DNA pol

Carboxyl terminal (220 aa) = RNase H

==Problems associated with RT enzymes==

#High Error Rate
#Sluggish and inefficient (at best 50% efficient)
#*RNase H degradation
#**Competition for degradation vs. extension during initial primer binding
#**Premature termination
#*Prone to Pausing
#**Sites rich in Secondary Structure
#**Homopolymer runs (particularily A)
#**Sensitive to [dNTP]


==Alternatives==
Thermus thermophilus DNA polymerase (Tth pol)

#Possesses RT activity in the presence of MnCl                
#*Synthesizes DNA from both RNA and DNA templates
#*Mn+ lowers the fidelity of DNA synthesis during PCR
#Thermostable
#Requires sequence specific primer to insure stable binding at elevated temperatures.
#Only capable of producing short products (~ 1-2 kb)
