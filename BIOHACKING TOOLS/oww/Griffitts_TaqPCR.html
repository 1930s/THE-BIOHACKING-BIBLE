__NOTOC__
==Materials== 
* ''Taq'' polymerase (NEB)
* [[Griffitss:Stock_solutions#10X_Taq_buffer|10X ''Taq'' buffer]] (w/Mg<sup>2+</sup>)
* [[Griffitss:Stock_solutions#10_mM_dNTPs|dNTPs]] (10 mM) (NEB)
* Template DNA
* Primers (10 μM from 100 μM stock)
==Procedure==
* Prepare your template sample
** For amplifying rhizobium sequences, boil a dense suspension of cells in [[Griffitts:Common_buffers#colony_lysis_solution_.28for_PCR.29_.28100_mL.29|PCR lysis buffer]].
** For amplifying ''E. coli'', adding cells directly to the reaction is sufficient.
* Thaw buffer, dNTPs and primers. Keep polymerase on ice throughout the procedure. 
* In standard PCR tube combine components according to the recipe below. Set the reaction up on ice.
** When running multiple samples, a Master Mix, which includes everything except the except the template and the primers (add 43.4 μL Master Mix to each tube)
** If performing multiple PCRs with the same primers, then just use 100 μM stock, calculate for 0.3 μl per reaction, and correct the volume of water.
* Select the appropriate cycling program and verify that all of the parameters are correct.
** Allow 1 minute of extension time per 1 kb DNA being amplified.
* Select "Run program" and select "YES" when asked about heated lid.
* Wait until block has reached the beginning temperature. Place PCR tube into the machine.
* Lower the lid until it latches and slightly tighten the heated lid onto the tubes.
