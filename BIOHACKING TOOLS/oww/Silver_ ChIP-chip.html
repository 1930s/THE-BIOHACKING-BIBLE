==Day 1-2 - Crosslinking/Pre-Incubation of Beads with Antibody== 
===Crosslinking===
#Pick 5 colonies of each yeast strain and grow up in 10 ml YEPD overnight
#Grow up 5 separate 50 ml cultures from the 10 ml cultures to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.5 to 1.0 in YEPD (50 µl from saturated 10 ml culture into 50 ml fresh YEPD for overnight growth yields the approximate OD range the next morning)
#*For alpha factor induction the OD<sub>600</sub> should be 0.2 before adding alpha factor
#**Add 1 µl of 2.5  mg/ml alpha factor (final concentration is 30 nM) for 2 h at 30°C
#Add 1.4 ml of 37% formaldehyde for every 50 ml culture
#Parafilm the flask and place on the shaker on which it was grown (usually 30°C). Let incubate with formaldehyde for 20 min
#Transfer cells to 50 ml falcon tubes and pellet at 4°C for 5 min at 3,000 rpm
#Pour off formaldehyde waste into formaldehyde waste bottle
#Resuspend cells in 25 ml of 1x TBS (tris-buffered saline)
#*5x TBS
#**100 ml Tris-HCl pH 7.5
#**150 ml 5M NaCl
#**750 ml ddH<sub>2</sub>O
#**Filter sterilize and store at 4°C
#**After diluting the 5x to 1x filter again
#Repeat wash with 10 ml of 1x TBS.  Waste can be dumped down the sink
#Resuspend pellets in 1 ml of 1x TBS and transfer to 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes
#Centrifuge quickly at RT to pellet, remove supernatant, and flash freeze in liquid nitrogen
#Tubes/cells can be stored at -80°C until experiment time
===Pre-Incubation of Beads with Antibody===
#Use 50 µl of magnetic beads per IP (Pan-mouse IgG product # 110.22 Dynal Dynabeads) and place in a 15 ml falcon tube. (I combine this step, so for 10 IP's I put 500 µl beads into one 15 ml tube, make sure beads are completely resuspended in stock bottle before removing)
#Spin for 1 min at 3,000 rpm at 4°C in tabletop centrifuge
#Use large magnet to attract beads and remove the supernatant with a pipette
#Immediately replace liquid (before beads dry) with 15 ml of 1x PBS with 5 mg/ml BSA (cold and filtered, made fresh).
#*400 ml 1x PBS/BSA
#**40 ml 10x PBS
#**360 ml ddH<sub>2</sub>O
#**2 g BSA
#Spin again, aspirate, and repeat wash with another 15 ml of 1x PBS/BSA
#Spin again, aspirate, and resuspend beads in 500 µl of 1x PBS/BSA for 10 IPs (depending on # of IPs this amount varies, just 50 µl per IP)
#For one IP, transfer 50 µl bead solution into a 0.5 ml tube and add 250 µl 1x PBS/BSA along with 10 µl of 9E11 monoclonal anti c-myc antibody
#Parafilm tubes and then place them in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, tape them in place. Place the tubes on a rotator in the cold room (4°C) overnight

==Day 3 - Cell Lysis/Sonication/IP==
===Cell lysis===
#Make fresh lysis buffer (Need ~2.5 ml lysis buffer for each sample, 45ml for ~18 samples)
#*For 45 ml of 1x lysis buffer
#**4.5 ml 0.5 M HEPES-KOH pH7.5
#**1.26 ml 5M NaCl
#**4.5 ml 10% Triton X-100
#**90 µl 0.5 M EDTA
#**450 µl 10% Na-deoxycholate
#**45 µl 1000x PLAAC (protease inhibitor cocktail)
#**225 µl 200 mM PMSF (made fresh, 150 mg PMSF + 4.3 ml 100% EtOH)
#**34 ml ddH<sub>2</sub>O
#Thaw crosslinked cell pellets on ice
#Resuspend the pellets in 200 µl lysis buffer and transfer to 1.5 ml screwcap tube
#Add micro glass beads to just under the level of the liquid
#Fastprep 1 x 40 sec, Power 6.5. Check under microscope, want >95% lysis, if not do 15-30 sec more
#Add an additional 500 µl of lysis buffer to each lysate and vortex briefly
#Pierce bottom of tube using 18 x 1 1/2 G needle. Place in a 2 ml screwcap tube and parafilm the two tubes together. Make sure hole is very tiny as any beads that go through will damage the sonicator tip later
#Place tubes in 4°C centrifuge without lid and pulse up to 7,000 rpm then stop
#Remove the 1.5 ml screwcap tube from the top, place caps on the 2.0 ml tubes, and pellet the insoluble chromatin (ie, the material we want) at 14,000 rpm for 7 min at 4°C
#Remove the soluble portion of the lysate and discard (do not want competition from soluble protein)
#Resuspend pellet in ~500 µl of lysis buffer, transfer to a 2.0 ml NUNC tube for sonication
===Sonication===
#Bring up volume to 1.8 ml with lysis buffer (using markings on side of the tube is sufficient)
#Immediately before sonicating each pellet, make sure it is in suspension. Pellets are sonicated 5 x 20 sec pulses at Power 4.0 with 30 s rests on ice in between pulses. Make sure the sonicator is tuned
#Transfer contents of NUNC tubes to 2.0 ml snap-cap tubes and spin for 1 min at 4°C at 14,000 rpm
#Transfer soluble portion (which can now be labeled as whole cell extract - WCE) to a new tube, let sit on ice as you wash beads from the prior day
===IP===
#Spin the 0.5 ml tubes in 1.5 ml Eppendorfs at 3,000 rpm for 1 min at 4°C
#Make fresh 1x PBS/BSA (5mg/ml)--filter
#Use small magnet, suck off liquid and replace with 500 µl of 1x PBS/BSA. Transfer to a 15 ml conical
#Add 10 ml 1x PBS/BSA to the 15 ml conicals and then place on rotator for 15 min at 4°C
#Centrifuge at 3,000 rpm for 1 min at 4°C in table-top centrifuge
#Using magnet, suck off 10 ml of 1x PBS/BSA and replace with fresh 1x PBS/BSA
#Repeat 15 min incubation at 4°C
#Spin down and resuspend Dynabeads in 200 µl lysis buffer (made fresh for the 2nd time that day because of decreased protease inhibitor half-life in aqueous solution)
#Transfer 200 µl Dynabeads (in lysis buffer) to a 2 ml Eppendorf tube along with 1.2 ml of WCE and incubate on rotator at 4°C overnight. Save remaining WCE at - 20°C for use in future steps

==Day 4 - Post-IP Washes/Elution/Reversing Crosslinks==
===Post-IP Washes===
#Make fresh lysis buffer (see above) and 200 mM PMSF (150 mg + 4.3 ml 100% EtOH)
#Make fresh high salt lysis buffer (360 mM NaCl final)
#*3.0 ml0.5M HEPES-KOH pH7.5		
#*2.16 ml 5 M NaCl
#*3.0 ml 10% Triton X-100
#*60 µl 0.5M EDTA
#*300 µl 10% Na-deoxycholate
#*30 µl PLAAC
#*150 µl 200 mM PMSF
#*21.3 ml ddH<sub>2</sub>O
#Spin down Dynabeads/lysate at 3,000 rpm for 1 min at 4°C
#Use small magnet, '''save supernatant''' and replace with 1 ml cold lysis (not high salt) buffer (you will quantify the protein levels in the WCEs, and in the depleted supernatants, and will run it on a gel along with some of the IP eluate to determine if your IP worked)
#Incubate beads in lysis buffer for 5 min on rotator at 4°C
#Repeat the 1 ml lysis buffer wash at 4°C
#Wash 2x 1 ml "high salt” lysis buffer at 4°C
#Wash 2x 1 ml "wash" buffer at 4°C
#*5 ml 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0 (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0)
#*25 ml 5 M LiCl (250 mM LiCl)
#*2.5 ml 100% NP40 (0.5% NP40)
#*25 ml 10% Na-deoxycholate (0.5% Na-deoxycholate)
#*1 ml 0.5M EDTA (1 mM EDTA)
#*441.5 ml ddH<sub>2</sub>O
#**Filter and store in the cold room
#**5 M LiCl = 21.2g LiCl up to 100 ml ddH<sub>2</sub>O
===Elution===
#To the rest of the samples, add 50 µl elution buffer
#*5 ml 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0 (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0)
#*2 ml 0.5 M EDTA (10 mM EDTA)
#*10 ml 10% SDS (1% SDS)
#*83 ml ddH<sub>2</sub>O
#**Filter and store at RT
#Vortex briefly before beginning incubation at 65°C for 10-15 minutes.  Vortex briefly every 2 min during the incubation. You can't overdo this step, so if you want to let it go 20 min then that's just fine
#Spin tubes at RT at 14,000 rpm for 30 seconds
===Reversing Crosslinks===
#Using magnet to hold beads, transfer 30 µl of IP samples to a new tube and add 170 µl of TE/SDS
#*1 ml Tris-HCl pH 8.0 (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0)
#*200 µl 0.5 M EDTA (1 mM EDTA)
#*1.6 ml 10% SDS (1 % SDS)
#*98 ml ddH<sub>2</sub>O
#**Filter and store at RT
#Since you do not use all of the IP, some will be available for checking by Western
#Thaw WCE from previous day, add 5 µl to a new tube and add 195 µl TE/SDS
#Incubate tubes at 65°C overnight to de-crosslink, use a heat-block or an adjustable water bath.  Not a bad idea to vortex and spin down the tubes once before you go home, just to make sure everything is being mixed and de-crosslinked

==Day 5 - Proteinase K Digestion/PCI Extraction and DNA Precipitation==
===Proteinase K Digestion===
#Remove tubes from 65°C and prepare Proteinase K mix--let tubes return to RT before adding Proteinase K mix as you do not want to heat-denature your Proteinase K
#Proteinase K Mix (per sample)
#*186.67 µl TE
#*4 µl glycogen (20 mg/ml)
#*10 µl Proteinase K (20 mg/ml)
#**May need to make this up in 15 ml conical since you have twice as many samples now (IP + WCE) to deal with
#Add 200 µl of Proteinase K mix to each sample and incubate tubes for 2 hours at 37°C
===PCI Extraction and DNA Precipitation===
#Transfer samples (~400 µl) to 2.0 ml Phase-Lock gel tubes (Eppendorf), tubes should be flash-spun before use just to get the gel down to the bottom of the tube
#Add 400 µl of cold phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (PCI) to each sample and pipette to mix.  Do NOT vortex
#Spin at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at RT
#Transfer aqueous (~370 µl, everything above the gel layer which defines the boundary between aqueous and phenol) to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube
#Add 14.8 µl 5M NaCl to each tube (gives ~200 mM NaCl final concentration)
#Add 2 volumes (~740 µl) of cold 100% EtOH, vortex briefly, and incubate at -20°C for at least 2 days

==Day 6 - RNase A Treatment/Blunting/PCI Extraction and DNA Precipitation/Preparation of Linkers==
===RNase A Treatment===
#Spin at 14,000 rpm for 40 min at 4°C (cold room-should see fluffy white pellet since there's still RNA around)
#Carefully pipette off supernatant and replace with 1 ml cold 70% EtOH, vortex briefly (setting 5), and spin at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C.  It is not necessary to remove all of the ethanol if you feel you will disturb the DNA pellet or the pellet is loose
#Carefully pipette off supernatant, spin briefly and remove the remaining liquid with a pipette
#Air-dry for a long time (2-3 h).  It is absolutely essential that the tubes be completely dry-the pellet should become somewhat clear and glassy looking
#Resuspend pellet in 30 µl of TE (pH 8.0).  To get the DNA fully into solution, I've found that incubating the tubes at 50°C with frequent vortexing (setting 5) and quick flashspins help it to go into solution.  I do this for about 10 to 15 min (the DNA survives 65°C overnight so the 50°C waterbath is NOT going to hurt it)
#Add 1 µl of preboiled 10 mg/ml RNAse A to each tube and incubate at 37°C for 1 h
#Purify using Qiagen gel purification/PCR cleanup kit and elute with 50 µl of EB Buffer (10mM Tris pH 8.0).  Have ~48 µl left here.  Add the 50 µl back to the filter and spin an extra time to recover as much DNA as possible
===Blunting===
#In separate PCR tubes, combine 2 µl of WCE + 38 µl ddH<sub>2</sub>O.  For the IPs, add 40 µl of immunoprecipitated DNA (no H<sub>2</sub>O needed)
#To each, add 70 µl of
#*11 µl 10x T4 DNA pol buffer
#*0.5 µl 10mg/ml BSA
#*0.5 µl dNTP mix (20 mM each, made fresh immediately before use)
#*0.2 µl T4 DNA pol (3U/µl)
#*57.8 µl ddH<sub>2</sub>O
#Mix by pipetting and incubate at 12°C for 20 min in a PCR block.  '''Do not''' use the heated lid option
===PCI Extraction and DNA Precipitation===
#Place on ice and add 12 µl of this mix
#*11.5 µl 3M NaOAc pH 5.2
#*0.5 µl glycogen (20mg/ml)
#Mix by vortexing and transfer to a 0.5 ml Phase-Lock gel extraction tube.  Add 120 µl of PCI and mix by pipetting
#Spin for 5 min at 13,000 rpm, RT
#Transfer ~110 µl to a new 1.5 ml tube and add 230 µl ice cold 100% EtOH
#Incubate at -20°C for at least 2 h (The longer the better, shoot for two days)
#Order Fresh Cy3-dUTP and Cy5-dUTP
===Preparation of Linkers===
*Best done the day before you need them
#Need 6.7 µl mix per sample
#*30 µl of 40 µM oJW102 (5'--GCG GTG ACC CGG GAG ATC TGA ATT C--3')
#*30 µl of 40 µM oJW103 (5'--GAA TTC AGA TC--3')
#*20 µl of 6x SSC
#Start tubes at 95°C in water bath.  Let water and tubes cool to room temperature, then place at 4°C overnight for use with ligations the next day

==Day 6 - Ligation==
#Spin for 30 min at 14,000 rpm at 4°C
#On ice, pipette off supernatant and wash the pellet with 500 µl cold 70% EtOH
#Spin for 20 min at 14,000 rpm at 4°C
#On ice, pipette off supernatant, flash spin and remove any remaining liquid. Cover and allow to air dry at room temperature for 2 h
#Resuspend pellet in 25 µl ddH<sub>2</sub>O (use the 50°C water bath with vortexing again to help it go into solution, 10-15 min at least). Once the pellet is in solution place the tubes on ice
#To setup ligations
#*Add 25 µl of cold ligase mix to each tube (make a stock solution, 5x or 6x for 4 samples)
#**9.67 µl ddH<sub>2</sub>O
#**5 µl 10x DNA Ligase Buffer
#**6.7 µl Linkers (mix of 40 µM each, from previous day)
#**0.5 µl T4 DNA Ligase

#Mix by pipetting and spin down to make sure all the liquid is at the bottom and incubate at 16°C
#*Let this go for at least 2 days

==Day 7 - DNA Precipitation/PCR Amplification==
===DNA Precipitation===
#Add 6 µl of 3M NaOAc (pH 5.2) and 130 µl of cold 100% EtOH, mix by vortexing and spin for 25 min at 4°C at 14,000 rpm (DO NOT incubate at -20°C here—do not want to precipitate un-ligated linkers which will ruin the PCR)
#Pipette off supernatant and wash with 500 µl 75% EtOH
#Spin for 10 min at 4°C
#Pipette off supernatant, spin and remove remaining liquid with a pipette, air dry at RT for 2h
===PCR Amplification===
#Resuspend pellets in 25 µl ddH<sub>2</sub>O and place on ice (50°C, vortexing as before), transfer to PCR tubes
#Add 25 ul of PCR mix to each tube:
#*5 µl 10x Thermopol buffer
#*11.75 µl ddH<sub>2</sub>O
#*5 µl dNTP (2.5 mM each of all 4)
#*1.25 µl oligo oJW102 (40 µM stock)
#*1 µl Amplitaq polymerase (5 U/µl)
#*1 µl Pfu Turbo dilution (dilute 1 µl of Pfu Turbo, 2.5 U/µl, in 20 µl ddH<sub>2</sub>O)
#Place samples in the PCR machine with the following program (takes ~1.5 h)
#*
Step			Time			Temp

#*Low T dNTP Mix
#**1.2 µl dATP
#**1.2 µl dCTP
#**1.2 µl dGTP
#**0.6 µl dTTP
#**95.8 µl ddH<sub>2</sub>0
#Add 3 µl of Cy5-dUTP to IP sample, and 3 µl of Cy3-dUTP to WCE sample, do in the dark since the dyes are light sensitive
#Add 1 µl of high concentration Klenow (from BioPrime kit), make sure to mix well
#Incubate at 37°C for 1 h (wrap in aluminum foil to keep dark)
#Use Qiagen purification kit to purify the DNA, elute in some considerable amount of EB buffer from kit (100 µl is fine-just want to get as much off the column as possible and the volume change doesn't matter since you'll be precipitating anyway)
===DNA Precipitation===
#Add 12 µl of 3M NaOAc, 260 µl of 100% EtOH.  Incubate at -20°C for at least a couple of days (wrap in aluminum foil to keep dark)
