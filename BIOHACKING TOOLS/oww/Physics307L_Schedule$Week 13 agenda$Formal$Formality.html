===Maybe the formality is necessary because as a reader of a scientific paper, one must constantly be trying to find problems with the published work, finding alternative explanations, or possible problems with the methods (and this is after the peer review which should be even harsher).  I suppose this would be pretty much impossible if the writing were very informal and amusing.===
