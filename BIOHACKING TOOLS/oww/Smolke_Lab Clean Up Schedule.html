===How It Works===
The laboratory clean up is performed once a week by a member of the laboratory in the order listed in the rotation schedule. Please try to keep with the schedule and perform the clean up at the end of the week. If you cannot conduct the clean up during your week trade with another member of the laboratory. You know it is your turn when you are a recipient of the lab clean up bottle on your bench. Once you have completed your clean up duties please pass the bottle on to the member on the rotation order after you.
