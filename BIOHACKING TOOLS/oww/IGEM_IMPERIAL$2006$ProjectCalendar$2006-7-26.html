== Open Issues==

*Need to double check ligation chart !!!

[[Image:IGEM_Imperial_Ligation_Chart.jpg|thumb|left|150px| ligation chart for test constructs]]


==Oscillator==

*The parameters of the oscillator are based on the OD of our 2 cells, their ratio and the volume of the culture.
** do we want to keep constant the growth ? How ?
**At which OD do we want the oscillator to operate ? which growth phase (exp, stationary ...) ?
**Is the use of a chemostat compatible with Lotka-Volterra dynamic ?
**In which media do we want to use the oscillator (LB, M9) and do the characterization ?

*Can we have access to Wallac Victor 3 equipement for characterization ? (ask Prof Freemont)
