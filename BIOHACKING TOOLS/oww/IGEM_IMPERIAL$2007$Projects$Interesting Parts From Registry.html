==Processes==
===Logic gates===
*Invertor
**Description:A transcription factor [LuxR] (BBa_C0062) that is active in the presence of cell-cell signaling molecule 3OC6HSL is controlled by a tetR regulatable operator (BBa_R0040). Device input is 3OC6HSL. Device output is PoPS from a LuxR-regulated operator. If used in a cell containing TetR then a second input signal such as aTc can be used to produce a logical AND function.
**Potential Use: Logic circuits

*Tet Invertor
**Description: A standar invertor where TetR represses ptet
**Potential Use: Found in thermostat
