To let the undergrad students have a voice <br>
To prevent under-representing units <br>
So that Course 20 students aren’t always hosed <br>
To perhaps start a MATLAB class?  <br>
In general, we think an undergrad should help decide things because they’ve been through it and know the problems.	<br>
