<b>Perceptual Biasing</b><br>
1. Select "HumanBiasPerception" from available KNOT plugins.<br>
2. On toolbar, open Channel Settings, Stimulus Settings and Behavior Settings windows.<br>
3. Enter the names of all Channels.<br> 
4. Check to see that the following fields in Stimulus Settings have default values specified below:<br>
:a. Pre-Interval (ms): 250 (period before Interval One)
:b. Interval (ms): 300 (length of each interval)
:c. Inter-interval (ms): 1000 (period between Interval One and Interval Two)
:d. Post-interval (ms): 50 (period after Interval Two)
::Note that there is only one interval in this plugin.  For now, presentation of the visual stimulus is time-locked to the electrical stimulation Interval defined by the parameters above.
:e. Select "Images"
::i. Images Stimuli: 7
::ii. Azimuth (deg): 0
::iii. Elevation (deg): 0
::Note that "Images Stimuli Loaded" is a counter for the number of Images Stimuli that have been loaded so far.  You can press the main Reset button, which <b>will not</b> reset the images loaded but <b>will</b> reset the eStimData window with all data plots.  The "Images Reset" button, on the other hand, resets everything, including the images loaded.
::v. Size (deg): 25
::vi. Press "Load Stimulus Images" and select all images in Desktop/Organized Images/BiasPerception as default.  The images in this directory should be unique to every electrode and the result of selectivity screening.  Stimuli will include a spectrum of ambiguity between a strongly preferred and anti-preferred stimulus. 
:f. Select "Electrical"
::i. Currents: 3
::ii. Indicate Max. Current (uA) from Microstim Staircase detection threshold data.
::iii. Indicate Steps per Octave from Microstim Staircase detection threshold data.  Current Factor will scale automatically.
::iv. Frequency (Hz): 200
::v. Pulse Width (uS): 200 
::v. Indicate "uA per V output" (If range max is below 1000 uA, use 100 uA per V.  If range max is above 1000 uA, use 1000 uA per V.)
::vi. DA Channel Out: 0
::vii. Marker Pulses Bit: 1<br>
::viii. Gate Bit: 0<br>
::ix. Check "TTL Marker Pulses." <br>
::x. Check "TTL Gate." <br> 

Note that subject will be making a judgement between preferred (2) and non-preferred (1) in a discrimination task.
