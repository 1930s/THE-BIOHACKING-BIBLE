===Purification of LuxR-His===
*Today we innoculated 2 litres of LB medium with E.coli containing the luxR-his plasmid (pMU117) to be grown to an O.D.<sub>600</sub> 0.5. After this the cells were harvested and frozen overnight.
*In addition an SDS-PAGE gel was run from a small sample of the soluble proeins from these cells, that had been purified using an affinity column (Nickel column for His tag).
*The gel was left to destain overnight
