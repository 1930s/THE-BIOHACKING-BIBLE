==pTet-LuxR-pLux-GFP construct in-vivo==
*'''Aim''': The aim of the test was to check if construct 1 of infector detector works in-vivo
*The protocols for the experiment can be found [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Wet Lab/Protocols/ID1.1|here]]
*The [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/new pages/in vivo|results]] of the test showed that pTet-LuxR-pLux-GFPmut3b is working in vivo and GFPmut3b produced increases with increasing [AHL]

==pTet-LuxR-pLux-GFP construct in-vitro==
*'''Aim''': The aim of the test was to check if construct 1 of infector detector works in-vitro, for a number of concentrations of AHL
*The protocols for the experiment can be found [[IGEM:here|here]]
*The [[Media:IC 2007 PLux in-vitro 05-10 25oC.xls|results]] of the test seemed very variable and didn't seemed to comply with the tests that were carried out before. There was a lot of variability between the samples and 4nM of AHL seemed to have fluorescence output greater than 50nM.
*It was decided to carry out the experiment again. The reasons for the inaccuracies in the data could have been:
**The reaction was not mixed properly or the right amounts were not pipetted
**The plates had already been used and thus could have affected the reaction
