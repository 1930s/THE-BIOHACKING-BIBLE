===Muscle===
*Be able to draw motor unit and label
*Be able to summarize contraction of myocyte
===Neuroanatomy===
*Know all lobes
*Know major gyruses and sulfices on actual brain
*Know 4 ventricles, purpose, how spatially related (focus on 3rd ventricle; landmark)
*Know grey vs. white matter
*Know nucleus vs. ganglion
*Major write matter highway (internal capsule)
*Know what cranial nerves are, what they do
*Memorize 12 cranial nerves (know whether motory, sensory, both) and where located and what foramen they run through.
*Know Circle of Willis (how it is a meeting point for several arteries)
*Know what each vein does and overall relation with brain
*In each portion of the brain, know which CN are exiting
*Know function of pons (message relay) and which CN exit
*Know Cerebellum (relay system from motor and sensory tracts)
**Know divisions of cerebellum
**Look into cerebellum image and be able to label
**Fibers of cerebellum
**Know function of each portion of cerebellum
*Midbrain
**CN that exit
*Diencephalon
*Thalamus 
*Pituitary gland, and what each lobe does, what is secreted from each one
*Diencephalon very different from midbrain cut
*Telencephalon (cerebrum)
*Limbic system - assoc with forebrain
*Basal ganglia - extrapyramidal system - lesions lead to what?
===Neuropathways===
*Pain
**2 categories of pain
*Temperature
*Spinothalamic tract - main pathway
*Unconscious proprioception - posture, cerebellum, spatial orientation
*Pyramidal system/tract - efferent pathway - brain to body - path crosses in medulla
**homunculus!!
**Corticopinal tract, corticonuclear tract
*Upper MN lesion - paralysis of fine-skilled movement, hypotony; Babinski (big toe up), Hoffman (thumb up), DTRs, clonus
**Not complete atrophy!
*Lower MN lesion - directly correlated to muscle
*Extrapyramidal system
**assists motor tract, balances for coordination
**Know nuclei in this tract (extra py cortex, basal ganglia, red nucleus, reticular formation)
*For tracts in general
**Know landmarks in tracts to be able to diagnose pathophysiologies
**Know what symptoms are assoc. with each tract
===Pathophysiology of EP System===
*Know pathophysiology terms
*Parkinsonism - disease of substantia niagra - symptoms: resting tremor, slow speech - treatment - L-dopa, etc
*Chorea - autosomal dominant
*Athetosis - disease of putamen
*Hemoballismus
