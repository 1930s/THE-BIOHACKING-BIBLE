**DNA (100 ng/&mu;L)
**[http://www.crane.com/prdSell.aspx?Name=BT886S_ThesisPapers Crane & Co. 100% cotton, acid free thesis paper]
*For using spots to transform:
**Harris Uni-Core Punch, 2mm and Olfa Cutting Mat
**[[TE buffer|TE]]
**Competent Cells

==Procedure==

===Making Spots===
[[Image:SpotGrid.jpg|thumb|left|Spotted Grid]]
*Mix 1 part 1% Cresol Red with 4 parts DNA that is at least 100 ng/&mu;L 
**''The exact amounts depend on how many 2 &mu;L spots you plan to make''
**''Using the excess of Cresol Red is helpful for when you transform, since you can visibly tell which cells have had DNA added and which have not''
*Make 2 &mu;L spots on 100% cotton, acid free thesis paper
**''Place a second sheet of paper under the one to be spotted to keep it free from contamination''
*Leave spots to dry at room temperature. ''This takes between 45 minutes and an hour''
*Once dry, spots can be used right away or stored at -20 &deg;C. To store - place the spotted paper between two others to protect it.

===Using spots to transform E. coli===

*Cut out spot from surrounding paper using the Uni-Core Punch on the Olfa cutting mat
*Soak spot in 20 &mu;L TE for 15 minutes. 
*Thaw competent cells on ice while spots soak
**''I used [[TOP10 chemically competent cells]]''
*Add 5 &mu;L of the TE the spot soaked in to 50 &mu;L competent cells
**''Spots could also be directly added to cells. Soaking in TE is better though, since there is DNA left over if the transformation does not work for some reason.''
*Incubate cells on ice for 30 minutes
*Heat shock cells at 43 &deg;C
**If cells are in individual tubes, heat shock for 30 seconds. If cells are in a 96-well plate extend the heat shock to 1 minute.
*Incubate cells on ice for 2 minutes
*Add 200 &mu;L [[SOC]] 
*Incubate at 37 &deg;C for 2 hours
*Spread cells on previously made LB plates with proper antibiotic
*Grow overnight at 37 &deg;C
