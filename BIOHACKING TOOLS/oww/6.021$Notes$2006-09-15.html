==Microfluidics==
* small channels about width of hair
* supports experiments not possible macroscopically
* small size inhibits mixing by convection
* mixing primarily due to diffusion
* no turbulence, laminar flow

==Diffusion into cells==
* Dissolve and diffuse model
* Fick's law for membranes <math>\phi_n(t)=P_n(c^i_n(t)-c^o_n(t), P_n=\frac{D_nk_n}{k}</math>
* Charles Overton: 1st studies of diffusion through cell membranes
** tested 100s of solutes, dozens of cell types
** Surprising results: everyone thought membranes were impermeant to essentially everything but water
* Overton's rules
** Cell membranes are semi-permeable
** plant and animal cells are similar
** permeabilities correlate with solubility of solute in organic solvents
** hypothesized that membrane is lipid (cholesterol and phospholipis) (was correct)
** some cells concentrate solute (active transport)
**Meyer-Overton theory of narcosis: potentcy of anesthetics correlated with lipid solubility
**muscles don't contract in sodium free media
* Collander: first quantitative studies
**find permeabilities and solubilities
** enormous range of <math>P_n</math> and <math>k_n</math>
** clear correlation between <math>P_n</math> and <math>k_n</math> but large scatter (many orders of magnitude)
** can be attributed to differences in diffusivity (due to molecular weight)
