'''Preparing the Over night Cultures'''
*Inoculate a culture from 10μl of stored culture in 5ml M9 minimal media containing 40 μg/mL Ampicillin. 
*Incubate at 37°C for overnight in a shaker.

'''Day 1'''
*Incubate M9 Amp Media 37<sup>o</sup>
*Remove the culture and measure O.D.600.
*We want to inoculate 10ml of M9 minimal media to give an O.D.600 of 0.1, to do this we calculate the ratio of volumes of:
**o/n culture in M9 media
**Pre-warmed M9 media
*Use simple calculate of: '''volume o/n culture = (0.1/O.D.600)*10ml'''
*This will calculate volume of o/n culture needed, this is then made up to 10ml with pre-warmed M9 media
*Then take the culture and inoculate pre warmed fresh culture of M9 medium to an O.D.600 of 0.1.
*Return the 10ml culture to the incubator and incubate at 37<sup>o</sup>C for 2 hours in a shaker.
**<font color=green> The purpose of inoculating a new media is because o/n they go into the stationary phase, but by inoculating a new media are returned to exponential phase</font>
<br>

'''2 hours Incubation'''

*After this, remove culture measure and record the OD600.
*Dilute again for an O.D.600 of 0.1 in a new culture of 15ml of a prewarmed M9 Ampicilin. (same principle as above)
*Spin down the cultures, retrieve cells and dispose of the supernatant
*To the cells add 15ml of prewarmed M9 Amp.
**<font color=green> This is to supply fresh media, ensures the cultures are more homogenous and that the cells are in exponential phase</font>

'''Plate Reader'''
*Pipette samples into a 96 well plate
*Add 200μL of growth medium to a well to act as a control
*Add 8 x 200μL of the cultures to the well.
*These 8 wells should then have 2ul of the inducer concentrations to each of the well.
*In addition want two controls:
#200μl of growth medium.
#Back ground fluorescence.
