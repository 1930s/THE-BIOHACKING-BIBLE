==Preparation of Cell Extract==
#O.D. of overnight culture was 3.417 at 9am (still less than mid-log phase of 0.D.600 = 4.5)
#Decided to harvest cells anyway
#Prepared s30 cell extract
#*Added protease inhibitors to the cell extract
#*Might add RNAse inhibitors when preparing the next cell extract if this one does not work

Protocols can be found at [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Notebook/General_Protocols#S30/S12 Cell Extract|S30/S12 Cell Extract]] in the general protocols page

==Testing of DNA Constructs==
#Cells containing constructs pTet-GFP and pT7-GFP and pTet-LuxR-pLux-GFP were incubated overnight at 37°C
#Tested for viability of construct '''pTet-GFP''' in vivo. '''Conclusion''': Works
#Tested for viability of construct '''pTet-LuxR-pLux-GFP''' in vivo. '''Conclusion''': Works
#Tested for viability of construct '''pT7-GFP''' in vivo. '''Conclusion''': Uncertain.
#*We realised that the E.coli cells were not yet induced to produce T7 promoter. 
#*200µl IPTG was added to 600µl of the cells, and placed in a 37°C incubator overnight
#*Testing for this construct will be done tommorrow
*pcI-GFP was not tested in vivo because construct was not ready.

==Pilot Preparation of Vesicles==
*'''Formation of Vesicles''': The suspension prepared the [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Notebook/2007-8-15#Pilot Preparation of Vesicles | day before]] was used to form vesicles.
#2ml of suspension was used to prepare an interface (according to the protocol)
#200x diluted GFP solution was used to prepare the emulsion
#Two samples were prepared:
#*One following the protocol, with 2ml suspension interface and 100&mu;l of emulsion added
#*One using 2ml of emulsion to form the interface, without further addition of material

*'''Results''': Very few vesicles were observed under a light microscope with phase contrast. The fluorescence microscope did not produce any results.

*'''Preparations''': The desiccation and suspension stages of the vesicle preparation protocol were carried out once again.
#Two 100ml beakers were prepared with 125&mu;l of DOPC in 50ml of mineral oil
#The suspensions were sonicated for 30mins each
#*At this point, it was found that the desiccator had no vacuum, and a further two suspensions were prepared as described above
#A total of four beakers, two well-desiccated and two poorly-desiccated, were produced
#These were left overnight in a 27&deg;C incubator
