==Aim==
Describe the steps of a standard BioBricks assembly for two parts and include images of expected results (e.g., gels, seq files, etc).  This will provide a walkthrough for someone new to BioBricks construction to practice with parts that are known to work together well.

==Steps==

Assumed starting point is from glycerol stocks of insert and vector.
==[[Streak plates]] of insert and vector from glycerol stocks==
[[Image:Streak plates.png|thumb|right|How to streak a plate]]
*Antibiotic Used:
*Incubation Time:

<br style="clear:both" />

==[[Bacterial cell culture|Grow 5ml Cultures]] of each from a single colony==
*Cellular chassis: Vector - Top10, Insert - MC4100
*Growth media: LB
*Antibiotic: Amp (5&mu;g/ml)
*Growth Temperature: 37C
*Spin speed: 51.7rpm
*Incubation Time: 14 hours, 50mins
*Final OD<sub>600</sub>: Vector 2.60, Insert 3.56

==[[Miniprep]] plasmid DNA from cultures==
*Prep concentration of vector: 107.2 ng/&mu;l (50&mu;l elution volume)
*Prep concentration of insert: 139 ng/&mu;l (50&mu;l elution volume)

==[[Restriction digest]] insert and vector with appropriate enzymes==
*Vector restriction enzymes used:
*Insert restriction enzymes used:
*Incubation time: Heat inactivation started at 11.10am.
*Any other details of protocol that aren't included in the protocol already.

==Run vector and insert on a [[Agarose gel electrophoresis|gel]]==
*Voltage: ?V
*Current: ?A
*Electrophoresis Time: ?mins
*Image of successful gel.  Any images of failed gels can be put on the common agarose gel problems page and linked to.  Of course there won't be any failed gels.

==[[DNA Gel extraction|Extract]] vector and insert from gel==
==[[DNA Ligation|Ligate]] insert and vector==
==[[Electroporation|Transform]] ligation product into competent cells==
Can use [[Electroporation|electroporation]] or [[Transforming chemically competent cells|chemical transformation]]

==Screen colonies for correct plasmid by [[Colony PCR|colony PCR]]==
[[Image:702px-I13600 - UV 254nm.jpg|thumb|Successful transformants should glow under UV]]  
Tranformants should glow when exposed to UV light.  Should probably point out that it's usually not this easy to screen.  We can also tell them to pick a couple that glow and a couple that don't to confirm that the colony pcr does a good job at predicting a successful tranformation.

==[[Miniprep]] DNA from chosen colony==
==Make glycerol and [[MIT:Sequencing BioBrick DNA|sequence DNA]]==
Expected lengths?
Include links to the parts registry and description of how to find parts?
