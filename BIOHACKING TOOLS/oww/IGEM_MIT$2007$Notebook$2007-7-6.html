==Agenda==
#Grow overnight liquid cultures of parts B0034. F2620, and E1010
#Request merR and Pmer from UGA

==Last night's plates==
First check at 9AM (~14 hrs incubation)
*Very small colonies because of: stacked in incubation room? bad transformation? fewer uL's on some plates? haven't incubated long enough?

==Transformed and plated another set==
*also did a positive control to make sure our cells can actually grow
*Controls: 1 plate of untransformed on LB+Amp, 1 plate untransformed on LB
