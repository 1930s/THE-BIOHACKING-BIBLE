==Amplification Culture of Ori-T==
select  Positive OriT-pEASY-3 Colonies from Plate,Culture in liquid LB,waiting for mini-prep.

==Double digesting test for pSB1A2(include E0040)==
*purpose:use pSB1A2 as vector.Should knock out fragment E0040 first.
*use Double digesting test for gel extraction.
*Digestion system contains:
<pre>
4 µl       10*H buffer
1 µl       EcoRI
1 µl       PstI
20 µl      Plasmid
14 µl      dH20
--------------------------
40 µl      Total

#After re-activation in LB liquid, Add 500 μL→50 mL (1:100) with LB- in a 250 mL flask, and incubate under shaking in 37℃.
#Monitor OD changes after shaking for 90 min.
#Harvest at 120 min (with OD 0.50) by cooling down the bacteria.
#Transfer each strain to a centrifugal tube, and balance it using another tube.
#Cool down strains to zero centigrade (Leave the culture on ice for 15 min)
#Meanwhile, cool down centrifuge to 4℃, and put 100 mM CaCl2 and 15% glycerol with 100 mM CaCl2 on ice.
#After cooling down the bacteria, centrifugate at 3500 rpm, +4℃ for 10 min.  Throw away the cleared liquid.
#Gently resuspend pellets in half culture volume (25 mL) sterile and cold 100 mM CaCl2
#Leave the suspension on ice for 20 min
#Centrifugate at 3500 rpm, +4℃ for 10 min.  Throw away the cleared liquid
#Gently resuspend pellets in 1/20 culture volume (2.5 mL) 15% glycerol with CaCl2
#Separate into EP tubes with 100 μL, cool them down thoroughly in liquid nitrogen, then hold in -80℃ overnight before using them.
