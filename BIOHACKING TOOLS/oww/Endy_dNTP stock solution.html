Each individual dNTP comes as 25 &mu;mol in 100 mM solution.  The lids are color-coded to each nucleic acid.

My dNTP stocks are:
*100x: 25mM each dNTP. Combine equal volumes of 100 mM individual dNTPs.
*10x: 2.5mM each dNTP. Dilute back 100x stock 1:10.
*Working concentration: 250 &mu;M<br>

This seems to make more sense than diluting individual dNTPs, the advantages being fewer tubes, no wondering if there's the same amount of each dNTP when you combine them, and fewer freeze-thaw cycles.
