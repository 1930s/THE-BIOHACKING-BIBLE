==Water Transport==
* Cells specific for water transport
* ~15 pounds of water secreted and reabsorbed daily
* hydraulic pressure: blood
* osmosis: cells

==Osmosis==
*Transport of solvent due to differences in solute concentration
* described by Dutrochet (early 1800s)
** developed 1st osmometer
* Wilhelm Pfeffer
** osmosis can be stopped by hydraulic pressure
** pressure proportional to concentration of solute
* '''isotonic''': concentration at which cells don't change in size
* osmosis is '''colligative'''
** depends on molar concentration not chemical properties of solute


===Van't Hoff===
* Found relationship identical to ideal gas law
* <math>\pi(x,t)= RTC_\Sigma(x,t)</math>
* Also works for salts if count ions of salt
* <math>C_\Sigma(x,t)</math> is called osmolarity in units of (osmol/volume)
* 1 osmol is the same as 1 mol
* <math>\pi</math>: units of pressure (Pa)
* ocean about 1000 osmol/m^3, <math>\pi\approx 25\cdot 10^5{\rm Pa}\approx 25{\rm atm}</math>

===Model===
* No one really understands osmosis
* requires semipermeable membrane
* solute collides and bounces off membrane
* membrane exerts force due to changing momentum of solute
* solute transfers momentum to solvent
* change in solvent momentum is equivalent to hydraulic pressure
* change in hydraulic pressure is change in osmotic pressure
* momentum of solvent increase away from membrane due to solute bouncing back off membrane

===Darcy's Law===
* flow through porous medium
* <math>\Phi_V(x,t)= -\kappa\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}</math>
* solvent flux is proportional to hydraulic pressure gradient
* continuity: <math>-\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(\rho_m \Phi_V) = \frac{\partial \rho_m}{\partial t}</math>
* water is incompressible so <math>\rho_m</math> is constant
* Therefore, flux gradient is zero so flux is constant and <math>p(x,t)</math> is a linear function of space
