<b>Eye Tracker Setup</b>


1. Open and load eye tracking software.<br>
2. Open and scale the jpg of the 9 calibration dots on the screen such that it occupies as much of the screen as possible.  Calibrate.
3. Open and initialize head tracking software.  Subject should be asked not to move head too much after this point.<br>
4. Move camera (zoom, focus) until one eye occupies almost the entire picture, showing very little skin.<br>
5. Using eye tracking software, set Illuminator very high and press autotracking (which should automatically locate the pupil and corneal reflection with white and black crosshairs.  Change thresholds manually if autotracking fails.  Consider uneven lighting and hard contacts as potential sources of failure.<br>
6. Once both the black and white crosshairs are stable, do standard (9-point) or quick (2-point) calibration.<br>
7. After successfully calibrating (i.e. no error message), do a quick check to see whether calibrated report of eye position is decent.<br>
8. In order to get eye position data in KNOT, one of the 16 channels must be used.
