== '''Calorie Controlled Food''' ==

Calorie controlled foods are measured for their calorie content using regular food as the base, so a 1.0 Normal(N) food is considered to have as many calories per volume as regular food, but the difference is there is no cornmeal.  Therefor a 2.0N food is expected to be twice the colorie content as a 1.0N or regular food.

To make a '''''x''''' Normal food, simply follow:

*'''''x''''' * 100 grams Sucrose<br/>
*'''''x''''' * 100 grams Brewers Yeast<br/>
*20 grams Agar
*1 L [http://www.millipore.com/catalogue.nsf/docs/C7658 MilliQ water]

'''Example:''' '''''x''''' = 1.5 N Food
    1.5 * 100 grams Sucrose = 150 grams Sucrose
    1.5 * 100 grams Yeast = 150 grams Yeast
    20 grams Agar
    1 L [http://www.millipore.com/catalogue.nsf/docs/C7658 MilliQ water]

==Cooking==
#Place flask with ingredients in it on a hot plate around 300 &deg;C while stirring with a stirbar
#Heat this until the agar is mostly disolved, keeping an eye on it to prevent:
##a boil over from having the temp. too high. or
##burning the ingredients in the bottom of the flask, also from having the temp too high
##adjust temp if needed. A high temp at first to get the solution hot and then lowering it to around 180&deg;C to continue disolving the agar and avoid burning is ideal.
#Once agar is disolved, take flask and place in an autoclave tray with an inch of water in the bottom and autoclave it for 20 minutes on a liquid cycle.
#Add a stirbar to the flask and place it on a cool hotplate, stirring until it cools to about 65&deg;C and then add approximatly 10 ml [[Helfand:tegosept solution | tegosept solution]] per Liter of food.
        10 ml tegosept for a single batch of 0.5N and 1.5N foods
        14 ml tegosept for a single batch of 3.0N since it has so much more mass than the others.
#Using an auto-pipeter, and a 50 ml pipet, dispense 5ml of food into each vial.
#*Each batch should make approximatly 200 or more vials.
