The KFFKFFKFFK cell-permeabilizing peptide was attached to PNA (a single-stranded piece of DNA/RNA that binds to mRNA to inhibit gene expression) and potency of e. coli to the PNA was increased as much as twofold.  However, it was not determined experimentally whether or not this increase was due specifically to increased cell membrane permeability.  Nitrocefin was used to check for outer wall permeability, NPN was used to check membrane integrity, and ONPG was used to check inner cell membrane permeability.
