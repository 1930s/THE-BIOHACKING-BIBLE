==Osmosis dynamics==
* change in both <math>A(t)</math> (surface area) and <math>V^i(t) \rightarrow C^i_\Sigma(t)</math>
* simplest case of concave cell (red blood cell)
** <math>A(t)=A_o</math> (constant surface area)
** not exponential solution. solve differential equation numerically
** find that shrinking is faster than swelling
** explained by fact that more water is needed to swell cell to twice volume as water lost to shrink to half volume
* for spherical cell, dynamics look identical to constant surface area case
* General conclusion: simple model of swelling agrees with equilirium and kinetic response of simple cells.
* But there are cases where it doesn't fit

==Water channels==
* family of aquaporins
* first discovered by Agre (AQP1, 28kDa)
* normal protein dyes don't stain this protein
* 1D, 2D, 3D structures solved
* positive charge in middle of this channel
* on one side water's negative side points towards it. once passed the middle of channel, the water flips direction.
