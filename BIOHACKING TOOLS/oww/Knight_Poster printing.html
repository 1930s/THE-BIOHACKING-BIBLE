==Conspirator==
Conspirator is the 42" plotter.  There is also a 36" plotter that I haven't used.  It is likely similar to use.

See [http://tig.csail.mit.edu/twiki/bin/view/TIG/PrintingToConspirator Printing to Conspirator] for information on how to print a poster.  Note that this conflicts with the instructions given below.  I am not sure which method is preferable.

See [http://tig.csail.mit.edu/twiki/bin/view/TIG/DIRPrintingScanningFaxServices TIG's printing site] for general information on printing in CSAIL.

#The small page preview should show up eventually.  Depending on the size of your file, it may take a while to render (10s of seconds).  This is a good way to verify that your settings are correct.
#Click Print
#Go to conspirator and verify that the poster is printing correctly and that the colors look OK.
#*If you don't like the poster, cancel the job to avoid wasting ink.

If you file is large (i.e. contains a lot of large graphics), printing can take a long time.  With really large files, it can take an hour.

PDFs tend to take less time to print (at least for LaTeX posters I've made where the figures are PS).  Perhaps 5 minutes.
