 <u>'''TO DO:'''</u>
 *Testing of T9002, J37016, J37020, S01656, J37015, J37015RS
 *Culture up J37022 and J37025 from plates in incubator for mini & maxi on Sunday
 *Move 3 plates (2 Rosetta and 1 BL21) into cold room

==Testing of T9002, J37016, J37020==

*<font color=red>Reported PROBLEM: After the 2hrs shake of the 16mL cultures, the OD of the T9002 assay was still at about 0.1. So all of the present culture was diluted further into 25mL.</font color>
*5mL tubes put into shaker for 4hrs at 13:15 
*Taken out of shaker at 17:20
:<font color = blue> OBSERVATION: Both cultures of J37016 & J37020 looked very transparent, whereas T9002 was very "milky" (high OD). <br> Was the OD read correctly when diluting into 25mL ? </font color>
*Pipetting into 96 well plate 
:<font color = red> PROBLEM: There was not enough cell culture in some of the 5mL tubes to fill all 8 repeats of the wells. There was only about 1.5mL culture in some of the tubes. In others, there was about 1.8mL. Why? </font color>
*Fluorescence reading in Biochem (18:00)
*Results: 
**T9002 shows a slight increase of flurescence with AHL increase (however, it is a line, not reaching saturation)
**J37016 do show the expected response, however, a sudden trough can be seen in at [AHL]=1nM 
**J37020 no change in fluorescence, apart from a trough at [AHL]=7nM
**See [http://openwetware.org/wiki/IGEM:IMPERIAL/2006/Results/T9002 results page] for data

==Culturing J37022 and J37025==

*Cultured J37022 and J37025 from plate for mini and maxiprep tomorrow
