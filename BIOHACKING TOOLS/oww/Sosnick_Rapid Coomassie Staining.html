'''Materials'''

Isopropanol fixing solution (see recipe)

Rapid Coomassie blue staining solution (see recipe)

10% (v/v) acetic acid


1. Place a polyacrylamide gel in a plastic or glass container. Cover the gel with 3 to 5
gel volumes isopropanol fixing solution and shake gently at room temperature. For
a 0.7-mm-thick gel, shake 10 to 15 min; for a 1.5-mm-thick gel, shake 30 to 60 min.

2. Pour out fixing solution. Cover the gel with rapid Coomassie blue staining solution
and shake gently until desired intensity is reached, 2 hr to overnight at room
temperature. Bands will become visible even in the staining solution within 5 to 30 min, depending on
gel thickness. The gel background will never stain very darkly.

3. Pour out staining solution. Cover the gel with 10% acetic acid to destain, shaking
gently â‰¥2 hr at room temperature until a clear background is obtained.

4. If necessary, pour out 10% acetic acid and add more. Continue destaining until clear
background is obtained.
