Lab meetings are usually held in the '''Macomber Room (48-216A) on Fridays ~noon ''' and the schedule is '''highly''' subject to change!

We have switched to using the Google Calendars to schedule lab meetings. If you are new to the lab and lack an linked account to the lab calendar, anyone in the lab can add you.
