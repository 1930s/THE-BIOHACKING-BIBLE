====='''iGEM projects 2007'''=====
-----------------
''' Alberta''':<br>
*Producing biofuels, in particular butenal.
**Propose to produce and optmise a bacterium for production of butenal i.e. increase the yield of production, decrease culture requirements and minimise other costs of final set up.
**choosing to use ''Chlorobium tepidium'' as host organism to system.

'''Bologna''':<br>
*Producing a genetic schmitt trigger and possibly apply this to produce a biological oscillator.

'''CSHL''': <br>
*Engineer the behviour of a fruit fly by remote activation of neurons involved in reward and punishment.
**Known: Fruit fly capable of learning through reinforcement
**Apply reward and punishment in presence of certain stimuli - fly can make associations and learn to seek/avoid previous stimuli
<br>
'''Princeton''': <br>
*Chassis engineering: make engineering of biological systems easier
**design a standard interface between an engineered biological system and its host cell or chassis <br>

*Rebuilding T7 genome: modelable version 
** Produce high level population epidemic bahaviour

* Collaborative projects on Open Wet Ware(don't know if these are their iGEM projects):
**Standard E. Coli strains for BioBricks in which more systems can be run
**Standardised GFP quantification
**Barcodes
**BioBrick parts for plasmid engineering
**Hydrogen photobioreactor
**Error detection and correction in replicating machines
<br>
'''Naples''': <br>
*Engineer a synthetic biological network and modify saccharomyces cerevisiae cells so that the colour can be detected at different oleate concentrations
**Parallel cloning and expresssion - two reporter genes cloned in parallel into a vector containing four different promoters
<br>
'''Mcgill''':
*First project is looking at fluorescence complementation.
**This is the idea that protein protein interactions can be measured and linked to the output of fluorescence.
*Second project is the biological repressilattor based on model proposed by Elowitz et al.
<br>
'''Paris''':
*First project is to create a synthetic multicellular organism.
**Idea to create artificial germ line cells that can develop into somatic cells.
***Only the germ line cells have the ability to divide, but, germ line cells require somatic cells to  produce key compound as germ line cells auxotropic.
***This set up is hoped to provide the pressures for development and sustainment to a synthetic multi cellar organism.
*Third project is to produce fat absorbing bacterium.
**Idea is to cause esterification of fatty acids and glycerol to provide a way to remove these products from the gut of an organism.
<br>
'''Virginia Tech.:'''
* Modelling dynamics of the spread of an epidemic within a population
**Cover biology of teh phage-host interaction 
**Spread of phage within an isolated population
**Spread of phage between artificially connected sub-populations
