==Conjugation Test==
* We want to do a conjugation efficiency test with wild type F to verify the protocol.
* And then test the conjugation efficiency with all the plasmids at hand.
* This is '''the exact experimental''' [[IGEM:Peking/2007/Count-Procedure-Conjugation | '''procedure''']]

==Helper plasmids construction==
* To construct helper plasmids, we need to knock out the oriT.
* To put conjugation under control, we need to knock out the relaxase.
* The Knockout method: '''(Anting please explain your method here)
'''

==Make more independent riboregulators(Lock & Key section)==
* We choose to use <bbpart>pSB1A2</bbpart> and <bbpart>BBa_R0010</bbpart>(Plac) to express the taRNA(<bbpart>J23066</bbpart>), and <bbpart>pSB3K3</bbpart> and <bbpart>BBa_R0040</bbpart> to express <bbpart>BBa_E0040</bbpart>, whose translation is under the control of crRNA.
* crRNA is synthesized as two partially overlap ~70bp long primers, and 5 cycles PCR can make it to a dsDNA with some BioBrick cloning sites flanked. ('''"2 primer strategy"'''--sunnyboy 05:26, 31 August 2007 (EDT))
* crRNA should be cut by XbaI at 5' and PstI at 3' and cloned into BBa_R0040 to get the full length BioBrick prefix and suffix.--[[User:YangYifan|YangYifan]] 04:19, 9 July 2007 (EDT)
* First, we will try out the UC Berkley riboregulators <bbpart>BBa_J23078</bbpart> and <bbpart>BBa_J23066</bbpart> first.
* This is '''the exact experimental''' [[IGEM:Peking/2007/Count-Procedure-Riboregulator | '''procedure''']].
===Supplement by Yu Tao===
*For conveniency, we abbreviate this section as '''''"Lock & Key"'''''. (I learn this from UC Berkeley team.)
*As is mentioned, the crRNA is the ''Lock'', and we use the '''"2 primer" strategy''' (as indicated by Yang Yifan) to synthesize the ''Lock''.
*As for ''Key'' which is not mentioned above, we first tried '''"3 primer" strategy'''(similar to '''"2 primer" strategy''', but we divided ''Key'' into 3 overlap parts so that we were able to synthesize the shorter parts at a relatively lower price), but failed.  Now we'd better try the '''"2 primer" strategy'''.

==Construct the tandem oriT region==
* For each conjugation plasmids, we want to construct oriT-taRNA-dbTerm-oriT.
* And Plac to the 5' and GFP to the 3' to test conjugation and deletion.
* Use pSB1A3 as backbone.
* This is '''the exact experimental''' [[IGEM:Peking/2007/Count-Procedure-tandem-oriT | '''procedure''']].

==Put the relaxase under the crRNA control==

==Assemble the tandem oriT together==

==Hop count experiement==
This is our goal.
