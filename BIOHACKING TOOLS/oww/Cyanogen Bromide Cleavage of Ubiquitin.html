Many cyanogen bromide cleavage protocols fail to cleave ubiquitin because of its stability in acid.  The following protocol has proved effective for cleaving the ubiquitin mutant I36W P37M F45W.

===Procedure===

#  Dissolve ubiquitin in 70% formic acid to a concentration of 1mg/mL.
#  Add CNBr to 20mg/mL.  For 3M CNBr in dichloromethane (under the hood), this works out to 0.063&mu;L per mL of final solution volume.
# Cover reaction vessel with tin foil and let stir for at least 6 hours.
#  Pipet the reaction mixture into dialysis tubing, seal, and dialyze.  Use a buffer of 0.2M NaCl, pH 2.0, with at least 3 washings.
#  Remove the reaction mixture from the tubing, then run on HPLC to purify and separate fragments.

===Notes===
*Cleavage occurs after a methionine residue, resulting in the conversion of methionine to homoserine lactone on the N-terminal fragment (causing a mass shift of -30).
*Ubiquitin mutants containing cysteine may require additional protection steps.
*Cyanogen Bromide is dangerous.  All solutions containing cyanogen bromide (including used dialysis buffer), as well as exposed disposable vessels, should be disposed of appropriately.
