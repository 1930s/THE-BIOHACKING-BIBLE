=Chemically competent bacterial cells=
All cultures are grown at 37 deg C and 300 rpm shaking. The OD<sub>600</sub> of the culture should be between 0.4 - 0.6. The culture is then centrifuged down at 3000rpm for 15min and the pellet resuspended in 1/10 volume of TSS. All steps are to be performed on ice. The tubes for the aliquots are also to be pre-chilled.
==Reagents needed==
The following reagents are needed for the protocol.
===TSS (Transformation and storage solution)===
For 50ml use the following ratios:
*LB: 30ml
*PEG: 5.0g 
*DMSO: 2.5ml
*MgCl<sub>2</sub>[1M]: 0.25ml
*MgSO<sub>4</sub>[1M]: 0.5ml
*100% glycerol: 7.5ml

Store all competent cells at -80 deg C for future use.
