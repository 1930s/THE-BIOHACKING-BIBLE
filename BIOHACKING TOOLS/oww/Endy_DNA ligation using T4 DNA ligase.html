''Back to [[DNA Ligation]]''
==Materials==

*[http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/productM0202.asp T4 DNA Ligase]
*10x T4 DNA Ligase Buffer
*Deionized, sterile H<sub>2</sub>O
*Purified, linearized vector (likely in H<sub>2</sub>O or EB)
*Purified, linearized insert (likely in H<sub>2</sub>O or EB)

==Procedure==
===10&mu;l Ligation Mix===
''Larger ligation mixes are also commonly used''
*1.0 &mu;L 10X T4 ligase buffer
*6:1 Molar ratio of insert to vector (~10ng vector)
*Add (8.5 - vector and insert volume)&mu;l ddH<sub>2</sub>O
*0.5 &mu;L T4 Ligase
===Calculating Insert Amount===
<math> {Insert\ Mass\ in\ ng} = 6\times\left[\frac{{Insert\ Length\ in\ bp}}{{Vector\ Length\ in\ bp}}\right]\times{Vector\ Mass\ in\ ng} </math>
===Method===
#Add appropriate amount of deionized H<sub>2</sub>O to sterile 0.6 mL tube
#Add 1 &mu;L ligation buffer to the tube.  <br>Vortex buffer before pipetting to ensure that it is well-mixed. <br>Remember that the buffer contains ATP so repeated freeze, thaw cycles can degrade the ATP thereby decreasing the efficiency of ligation.
#Add appropriate amount of insert to the tube.
#Add appropriate amount of vector to the tube.
#Add 0.5 &mu;L ligase. <br>Vortex ligase before pipetting to ensure that it is well-mixed.  <br>Also, the ligase, like most enzymes, is in some percentage of glycerol which tends to stick to the sides of your tip.  To ensure you add only 1 &mu;L, just touch your tip to the surface of the liquid when pipetting.
#Let the 10 &mu;L solution sit at 22.5&deg;C for 30 mins
#Denature the ligase at 65&deg;C for 10min
#Dialyze for 20 minutes if electroporating
#Use disks shiny side up
#Store at -20&deg;C

==Notes==
Make sure the buffer is completely melted and dissolved.  Precipitate is DTT (or BSA?).  Probably best to aliquot this buffer into smaller portions, to reduce the freeze/thaw cycles.  In general, make sure the buffer still smells strongly like "wet dog" (Checking if the DTT is still good.)
