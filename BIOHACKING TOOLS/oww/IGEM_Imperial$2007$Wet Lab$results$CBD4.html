==Discussion==
Figure 1.1 and Figure 1.2. show us that the synthesis of GFPmut3b increases with DNA added. Though the molecules of GFPmut3b synthesised increases with increasing DNA concentration, even after a concentration of 4&micro;g. This is not what was expected because of the nature of the cell free chassis which is optimum DNA concentration = 4&micro;g. But the increase in fluorescent moecules synthesised by increasing DNA concentration is not very big. If DNA concentration is increased from 2&micro;g to 6&micro;g (a percentage increase of 200%), it reuslts in only about 15% increase (at 360min) in GFPmut3b molecules synthesised. Thus it was decided that a DNA concentration of 2 or 4&micor;g will be used for testing pTet-GFPmut3b construct.

==Conclusion==
To conclude the following approximations can be made:


Optimum DNA concentrations - 2 or 4Âµg of DNA
