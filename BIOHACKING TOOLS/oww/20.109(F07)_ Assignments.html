==Layout of the class==

You will perform three series of experiments (called “modules”) over the course of the semester. The modules differ in length and in the ways you will be assessed. The experiments and your assignments are:

You will be working as pairs throughout the semester, but you will <font color = red> submit individual lab reports and give individual oral presentations</font color>. 

In addition to the assignments listed above there will be 
*'''Daily Lab Quizzes''' (5% of final grade)
**These are intended to refresh your memory about the experiment you are performing. They will not be hard and should take no more than 5 minutes at the beginning of lab.
*'''Homework Assignments''' (10% of final grade)
**These will vary considerably in content and points associated with each assignment. You may be asked to perform a calculation, draw a conclusion, and/or make a figure using the data you have collected. The homeworks can be found in the "for next time" section of each lab day. <font color = red> You can work with your lab partner, friends and teaching assistants on these assignments but you will hand in individual assignments. </font color>
*'''Laboratory Notebooks''' (5% of final grade)
**You will record your data on the white pages of a bound notebook. The yellow, duplicate pages will be collected and evaluated by the teaching assistants. Guidelines for notebook keeping are [[20.109(F07):Guidelines for maintaining your lab notebook| here.]] 

<font color= red><b>Late work will be penalized 1/3 of a letter grade for each day late and will not be accepted after a week.</b></font color>

==Lab Attendance==

Lab attendance is mandatory and there are no make-up labs. A family crisis or severe illness requiring attention from the infirmary and prohibiting you from all your coursework are acceptable reasons for missing lab and every effort will be made to accommodate you in these exceptional circumstances.
