==M/N Digest of I2055==
*Hopefully it has the promoter
*Ligated into 1AK3 and transformed.

==Colony PCRs==
*Running a gel
**loading order:T9002 in 3K3 (4-1), I2055 in 1AK3 (1-4), E0240 in 3K3(4-1), E0240 in 1AK3(1,2).

*Seems to be a problem with 3K3 (perhaps not digested fully?)
*Making cultures to sequence:
**T9002-3K3(bad): #3
**I2055-1AK3: #1
**E0240-3K#(bad): #3
**E0240-1AK3: #1
*Since 3K3 may be causing the problems, making o/n of it to mini-prep tomorrow and digest.

==I2056==
*Prepared sequencing reaction.
