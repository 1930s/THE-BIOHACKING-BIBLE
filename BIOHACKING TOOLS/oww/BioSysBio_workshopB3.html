===Reconstruction Biological Pathways with EPE===

Part 2 will focus on the reconstruction of '''signal transduction''' pathways.

The tutorial will take participants through the steps of reconstructing,
analysing and modelling biological pathways using graphical notations
within the Edinburgh Pathway Editor (EPE; EPE is a visual editor
designed for the annotation, visualisation and presentation of a wide
variety of biological networks, including metabolic, genetic and signal
transduction pathways). This will be a "hands-on" tutorial where
participants will work through specific examples using EPE.
Specifically, participants will learn about the main graphical
pathway notations supported by EPE and how to use them. They will also
learn how to use them to reconstruct signalling pathways from the
literature and other online resources and associate notes and other
annotation within their EPE pathway maps. Finally they will learn how to
export their maps from EPE to allow them to analyse their pathways using
network topology analysis and computational modelling tools.

The tutorial will be hands on and participants are recommended to 
'''bring a laptop''' with the latest version of '''EPE preinstalled'''. Further
instructions, EPE and tutorial materials can be obtained from
