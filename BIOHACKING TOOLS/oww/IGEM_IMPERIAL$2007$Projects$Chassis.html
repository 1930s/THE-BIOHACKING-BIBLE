==Standard Units==
*We need a standardized units to compare expression in different chassis.
*Ideal unit for this is PoPS (Polymerase per Second), however this cannot directly be measured. Currently the best approach is to measure indirectly using '''Rate of GFP molecules sysnthesised sec<sup>-1</sup> CFU<sup>-1</sup>''' (CFU meaning Colony forming units which is a measure of cells)
*We would like to use this approach, however, there is no CFU in in-vitro and in-veso. We need to change CFU so we can relate it to in-vitro and in-veso.

==Chassis Characteristics==
List what we plan to characterize that are chassis dependent characteristics e.g. temp, life span of chassis
==Construct Dependent Characteristics==
List what we plan to characterize that are construct dependent characteristics e.g. change of expression.
