==Course Description==


===Recruitment E-mail Draft===

We are two BME students who envisioned a course very unlike our technical courses that would allow students to think outside of the box, increase opportunities for brainstorming with peers, and explore career options beyond graduate and medical school.  With the help of Dr. Randi Voss, we have created Social Entrepreneurship and Engineering — a project-based course to help draw out and build up creativity, brainstorming, and team building skills towards social innovations. 

During the semester, we will study a broad range of social concerns, examine success stories of individuals and groups who made a difference in their community, select an issue on which to concentrate, develop a creative strategy to raise awareness of that particular issue (i.e. film, advertisement, rally speech, etc.) and then attempt to “solve” this issue through whatever ways are relevant.

Although these goals may seem lofty, we believe that this is the best time to think big, to find others who are interested in similar goals, and to explore our potentials.  Why wait until we graduate when we can start now?

“Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world.  Indeed it’s the only thing that ever has.” —Margaret Mead

#Ask students what they want to do with their lives
#Show typical eduation setting - textbooks, exams, GPA - which lead to 9-5 jobs (cubicles) whose purpose is just to earn a living, maintaining the status quo
#UT phrase - "What starts here changes the World"
#The reason we started this course - Social Entrepreneurship - to inspire creativity, innovation, to get us to think beyond ourselves, beyond grad and med school
#Because let's face it - there's a lot to do:
#*show clips/scenes of domestic and social concerns

#And for that, there's no reason to wait until you graduate, who says we can't try to change the world now? Who says it can't be us? It always starts small, and it always starts with one person
#*fast clips of famous individuals who's made a difference
#End with Margaret Mead quote
