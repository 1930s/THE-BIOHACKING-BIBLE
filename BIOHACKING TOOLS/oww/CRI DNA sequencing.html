This protocol will allow you to perform cycle sequencing usin ABI BigDye chemistry.

==Workflow==

==Materials==
ABI Big Dye kit 3.1 part number 4336917

Miscellaneous Reagents


==Protocol==

=== Sequencing reaction setup ===
Using ABI Big Dye kit 3.1 stored at –20˚C aliquoted out, set up the following reaction to sequence plasmid DNA.

*DNA template = 		1ul (200ng of plasmid DNA or Templiphi template DNA)
*Primer=              		eg.m13f/r(10ug/ml ,3.2pmole/ul) 1ul (make sure primer is correct for vector)
*Big Dye Mix3.1=		1ul
*5xbuffer=             	1.5ul
*Water=                  	Xul
*Total=                 	10ul
Add all the components to a thin walled PCR tube (0.2ml thermo strip AB-0266, stores stocked, in 96well plate format) or 96 well plate and then spin in [[CRI SOP sigma 4K15 centrifuge|sigma 4K15 centrifuge ]] @ 2000rpm for 10secs), cap tubes and '''LABEL THEM''', spinning down should mix them.
Perform cycle sequencing reactions on a PCR machine [[CRI SOP MJ Research PTC225 Tetrad|MJ Tetrad]] close and tighten lid use heated lid) and run the following program:

Protocol name: CRISEQ1

#96˚C for 10 sec
#50˚C for 5 sec (ramping at 1˚C/sec) 
#60˚C for 4mins 
#goto step1 24 times
#4°C hold
#End

Reactions need to be [[CRI sequencing reaction ethanol precipitation|precipitated]] and run on automated [[CRI SOP ABI3100 guide|sequencer]].
