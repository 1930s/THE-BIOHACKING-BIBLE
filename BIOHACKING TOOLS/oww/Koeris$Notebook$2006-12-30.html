Studying for the math quals... [[Wikipedia:Ordinary_differential_equation|ODEs]] and [[Wikipedia:Partial_differential_equation|PDEs]]

There are only a limited number of types of questions on the math qualifier exam.
One that always crops up is solving a system of linear equations, either homogenous or non-homogenous, and usually with constant coefficients.

The approach to solving that is of course finding the determinant of the coefficient matrix and then using the eigenvalues to construct the eigenvectors <math>\overrightarrow{v1},\overrightarrow{v2}</math>. The equation then has the general form of a homogenous solution as follows:
<math>y &= e^{\lambda x}</math>

to form the characteristic equation

<math>
{\lambda^n +a_{n-1}\lambda^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1\lambda+a_0 = 0}
</math>

   
to obtain the solutions

    \lambda=s_0, s_1, \dots, s_{n-1}.

When this polynomial has distinct roots, we have immediately n solutions to the differential equation in the form

    {y_i(x)=e^{s_i x}.}
