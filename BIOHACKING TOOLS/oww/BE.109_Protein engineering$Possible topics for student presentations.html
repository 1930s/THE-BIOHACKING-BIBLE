{{Template:BE.109}}

The list of papers below is provided as a guideline for the types of papers that might be relevant for your presentation. You will notice that the papers fall roughly into three categories- biochemistry, protein engineering/assay development, and reports describing the biological role of endogenous beta-galactosidase.

You are not limited to the following list of primary research articles. The list is provided simply to give you an idea of the kinds of subjects that could make suitable presentations for the class. Search pubmed yourself (http://ncbi.nih.gov/PubMed/) to find articles of interest to you. Once you have decided on a paper for your presentation, please email it to nkuldell AT mit DOT edu. As you prepare your talk be sure to follow the specific guidelines for oral presentations ([[BE.109:Guidelines for oral presentations |'''Guidelines for oral presentations''']]).
