Someone want to put a summary here for Veena and Giovanni?

==Questions==

===Question 1===
Especially for Reshma, but for others as well: it seems as if the idea of producing genetically engineering flavors and fragrences on a mass scale is pretty common.  Thus, we thought that it would really be necessary for us to come up with an application (in which we controlled production of whatever scent; like it was said earlier, this is the important part) for this.  So, should we try to come up with an application now?

===Answer 1===
You're right that generating a smell in a microbe is not by itself novel.  But once you have that part working, there are several potential applications or directions you could take the project.  (I listed some on the board today.)  I think that outlining some of the applications that you think are both interesting and practical would helpful for the project summary.  But that doesn't mean we can't come up with something different later.

===Question 2===
What exactly has Ed DeLong been able to accomplish with the autotrophic bacteria so far?  Are there any papers to read?

===Answer 2===
*'''[[User:Austin|Austin]] 17:02, 5 June 2006 (EDT)''': I have a binder of proteorhodosin papers here (this is from several years ago, so doesn't include any newer stuff). If you want it, you can come by to pick it up.
*'''[[User:Bcanton|BC]] 17:29, 5 June 2006 (EDT)''': I just emailed someone in the DeLong lab who works on this stuff.  I'll post any reply I get from her regarding the current status of their work.
*'''[[User:Nkuldell|Natalie]]''': With apologies, I'm an advisor from last year chiming in here just to offer the proteorhodopsin clones that I got from the Delong lab last summer. They are reported to be sensitive to different wavelengths of lights. I'm happy to streak them out for you if they can be useful for you to work with.
*'''[[User:Jasonk|Jasonk]] 10:53, 6 June 2006 (EDT)''': I posted this on the brainstorming page (with some other comments), but you might want to check out this [http://peds.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/19/3/113 paper] as well.  If you're going to make autotrophic bacteria you'll need to combine the proton pump with a means for getting carbon from CO2.
