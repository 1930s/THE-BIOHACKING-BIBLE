==To Do==
*Decide how to re-do PCR
*Problem is likely dNTP dilution

==Device culture==
*No growth once again.

==PCR==
*Re-doing all PCRs, with new dNTP dilution (2.5 mM)

==Construction of promoter tester==
*Re-transforming B0032 from iGEM distro
*Also running digest of B0032 from old prep
*Plating rest of the culture
