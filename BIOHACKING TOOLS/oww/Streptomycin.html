==Mode of Action==

Inhibits protein synthesis; binds to 30S ribosomal subunit.

The rpsL50 gene mutation conveys streptomycin resistance.  Resistance is recessive, so the presence of a wild type rpsL gene will convey sensitivity.   This allows counter-selection against the presence of the wt rpsL gene.  Mutations of wild type genes to convey resistance are common.

==Mechanism of Resistance==


==Usage Notes==

#100 mg/mL stock solution in H<sub>2</sub>O.  <br> It is barely soluble in ethanol so you must dissolve it in H<sub>2</sub>O.
#Filter-sterilize with 0.22 &mu;m filter.  
#Add 1 mL per liter of culture.
