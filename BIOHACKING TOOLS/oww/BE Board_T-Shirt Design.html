==Comments/ Ideas==
Since we have recently aquired a course number and started our undergraduate major, it seems like it might be time to start thinking about a Course 20 T-shirt (or "Hoodie").  Please record any ideas you have about how to solicit designs, design constraints, or other thoughts.  I (Amy Nichols) intend to spearhead this project and present a proposal at the next BE board meeting.
:Designs can be solicited via a design competition, and the winner gets a free shirt. This usually works pretty well. An email to the BE list should do the trick. Depending on how much $$$ we want to spend, we'll probably shoot for two or three colors. [[User:Yeem|yeem]] 18:27, 13 April 2006 (EDT)
*'''[[User:Bcanton|BC]]''' - I like the competition idea and it worked well for the IM shirts.
