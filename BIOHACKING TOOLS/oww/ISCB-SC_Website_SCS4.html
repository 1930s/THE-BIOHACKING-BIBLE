*Providing the list of attendees so that any person WILLING to share room could contact them 
*Providing information about Toronto and other social activities: Dos and Donts' for visitors.  *Information regarding Visas etcetera 
*Would it be a good idea to link this to ISCBSC forum for users to interact about SCS4?
