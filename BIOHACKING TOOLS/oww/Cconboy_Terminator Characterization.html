Experiments performed by Caitlin Conboy, Fall 2003

===Background===

The rational design of integrated biological systems requires a set of characterized, compatible components. Here we  characterize a set of transcriptional terminators contained in the registry of standard biological parts. [http://parts.mit.edu/r/parts/partsdb/pgroup.cgi?pgroup=Terminator]. We measure termination efficiency by inserting each terminator between the coding regions for CFP and YFP on a polycistronic message and measuring the fluorescence ratio of the two fluorophores by flow cytometry.
