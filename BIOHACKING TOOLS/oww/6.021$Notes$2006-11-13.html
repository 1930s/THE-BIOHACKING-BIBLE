==Cable model==
* experimental data from lobster: <math>\lambda_c \approx 1.3</math> mm
* Thus, infinitesimal electrode means much smaller than 1 mm and remote electrode means much greater than 1 mm
* The distance a signal can travel without Hodgkin-Huxley regenerative mechanism is quite small
* Look at dynamics of stimulus pulse
** Pulse in space and time
** Solution of form: <math>v_m(z,t)=w(z,t) e^{-t/\tau_m}</math>
** where <math>\frac{\partial w}{\partial t} = \frac{\lambda_c^2}{\tau_m} \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial z^2}</math>
*** This is the Diffusion Equation with <math>D=\frac{\lambda_c^2}{\tau_m}</math>
** The effect of the stimulus diffuses down according to w but also dissipates equally across the membrane
* In decrement free conduction (HH), space/time relationship follows wave equation whereas in decremental conduction in cable model, it's diffusion-like
