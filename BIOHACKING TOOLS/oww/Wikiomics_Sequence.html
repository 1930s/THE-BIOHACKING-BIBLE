The sequence of a linear polymer such as a protein, DNA or RNA is the [[wikipedia:sequence|sequence]] formed by its [[wikipedia:monomer|monomers]]. It is also referred to as the ''primary structure'' of a given molecule.

The sequence of standard proteins, DNA, or RNA can be expressed as a string  over a finite alphabet that represents well-studied monomers. It allows the development of many powerful algorithms and statistics.

Although sequence analysis constitutes an important panel of [[bioinformatics]], sequences are only one of the many forms of experimental data that are available to the bioinformatician.
