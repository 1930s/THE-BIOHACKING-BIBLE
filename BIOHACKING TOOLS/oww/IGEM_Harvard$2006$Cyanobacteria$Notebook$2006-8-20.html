==Miniprep of J04500==

Played Jazz in the lab & miniprepped .2 mL J04500 as per the todo list left yesterday.

Notes:  Eluted in H20

Left 4 miniprep tubes in our fridge.  nanodrop results as follows:
1: 12.6
2: 13.2
3: 15.6
4: 14.2

The results are just about what we get every time.

Digests will follow later after dinner.

Anyone want to take a crack at the presentation for tomorrow while I do the digests?  Or anyone want to do the digests and I'll take care of the presentation?  Let me know.

==Digestion of J04500 with X-P & S-P, KaiA/B/C with X-P==
Performed the digests of the midiprepped KaiA/B/C and the miniprepped J04500 from earlier today.  Ran two digests of each of the following:
J04500 with X-P
J04500 with S-P
KaiA/B/C with X-P
