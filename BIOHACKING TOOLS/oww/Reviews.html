==OpenWetWare Reviews==

OpenWetWare Reviews is an experiment in providing always up-to-date scientific reviews.  When a new publication comes out it can be easily incorporated into the review by OWW editors.  This should be a win-win for both the review-writer (less work) and the readers (who get a more up-to-date resource).  We'll be trying reviews with a 'curator' (as discussed for [[Consensus protocol|consensus protocols]]) as well as ones without.
