==E.coli Treatment Protocols==
Includes all protocols for culturing, handling and treatment of E.Coli.

==Plate Preparation==
*Materials:
**LB-Agar Medium capsules (Bio 101 Systems)
**Ampicillin Ready-made Solution (Sigma A5354-10ML)
**Kanamyacin solution from Kanamyacin Sulfate- (Shelton Scientific IB02120)
**DNAse, RNAse free Distilled Water (Gibco 5288)
**Para film

*Procedure:
**To make approximately 5 plates:
#200ml DI water
#8 capsules LB Agar
#Autoclave and let cool
#Add appropriate anti-biotic (200μL) (Kanamaycin for 111’s, 203’s, Ampicillin for M1’s and both for Oscillator cells)
#Pour in Petri dishes, let it settle and Para film.
#Parafilm, and store at 4C.
#To streak plates, touch single colony with inoculating loop and streak in zig-zag pattern. Leave in warm room (37 C) over night.

==Sample Preparation==
*Materials:
**14ml Polystyrene Round-Bottom Tube (Falcon 352057)
**Inoculating loops (Fisherbrand 14-375-103)
**[[Timp:M9Protocol| '''M9 Media''']] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*Procedure:
#Touch single colony with inoculating loop and put it in 5mL of M9 media in round bottom tube. 
#Leave it in the warm room shaker over night.
#Before the experiment dilute the saturated culture 1:5 and let it sit in the RT shaker for at LEAST 2hrs.
#Spin it down at 1.4krpm for 2 min and re-suspend the pellet in M9 with appropriate antibiotic and let it sit in a vial for 15 min.
#Spin it down again and gently re-suspend in M9 with no antibiotics.
==Freezing E.coli in Glycerol Solution==
*Materials:
**Glycerol - Sigma G2025-500mL
**Magnesium sulfate - Sigma M2643-500g
**Tris*Cl pH 8
**2.0 ml Cyrogenic Vial  (Corning-430659)
*Procedure:
#Add ingredients in the following concentrations (brackets show values for 50mL):
##60% Glycerol (30mL)
##0.1M MgSO4 (0.602g)
##0.025M Tris *Cl pH 8 (0.197g)
##Rest is 18 Mohm water (20mL) 
#Mix 1mL of freshly saturated culture with 1mL of glycerol solution in cyro Vial
#*(an overnight culture will do here)
#Immediately store vial in -80C freezer

==Thawing Glycerol Frozen E.Coli==
*Materials:
**LB Agar plates (refer to Plate Preparation protocol above)
**Frozen Cell Culture
**Inoculating Loop
**Parafilm
*Procedure:
#Scrape out a splinter or two of frozen culture and streak onto plate.
#After Splinter has thawed, streak with inoculating loop
#Grow at 37 C overnight. Plate should be inverted at ALL times.
#Next day examine plate. Plates may be stored wrapped in Parafilm at 4C for less than one month safely.
