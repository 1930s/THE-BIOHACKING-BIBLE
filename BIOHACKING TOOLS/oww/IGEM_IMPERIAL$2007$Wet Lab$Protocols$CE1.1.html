==Protocol for Preparation of ''E. coli'' S30 Extract==

===Day 1===

====Equipment====
*37°C shaking incubator
*1L conical flasks x 3
*Pipette fillers + pipettes (5ml, 10ml and 25ml)
*Spectrometer + cuvettes
*Weighing scale
*Centrifuge + 150ml centrifuge tubes
*Pipettes + pipette tips (20µl, 200µl and 1000µl)

====Reagent====
*2xYT medium
*IPTG
*Buffer A
**10mM Tris-acetate (pH 8.2)
**14mM Mg-acetate
**60mM K-lutamate
**1mM dithiothreitol (DTT)
**0.05% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME)

====Procedure====
'''Growing the cells'''
#Grow ''E. coli'' strain BL21 (DE3) cells at 37°C in 3L of 2xYT medium till O.D.600 = 0.6.'''Ensure vigorous agitation and aeration.'''
#Add 1mM IPTG to cell culture to express T7 RNA polymerase.
#Harvest cells when O.D.600 = 4.5. '''At this point, cells are at mid-log phase.'''
#Wash cells three times by suspending them in 20ml of buffer A per gram of wet cells.
#Centrifuge and weigh the wet cell pellets before storing them at -80°C.
''(Note: The cells may take more than 1 day to grow to O.D.600 = 4.5.)''

===Day 2===

====Equipment====
*Pipette filler + pipettes (5ml, 10ml and 25ml)
*Weighing scale
*French press + French press cell
*Centrifuge + 50ml centrifuge tubes
*Pipette + pipette tips (20µl, 200µl, 1000µl)
*37°C shaking incubator
*Dialysis membrane with molecular weight cut-off of 10,000
*Magnetic stirrer
*4°C cold room

====Reagent====
*Buffer B
**10mM Tris-acetate (pH 8.2)
**14mM Mg-acetate
**60mM K-glutamate
**1mM DTT
*Pre-incubation solution
**293.3mM Tris-acetate (pH 8.2)
**2mM Mg-acetate
**10.4mM ATP
**4.4mM DTT
**0.04mM amino acids
**16.9mM phosphoenolpyruvate
**0.77U/ml pyruvate kinase
''(Note: For the ATP regenerating system in the pre-incubation solution, phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase are used instead of creatine phosphate and creatine kinase. This is due to cost considerations.)''

====Procedure====
'''Lysing the cells'''
#Suspend thawed cells in 12.7ml of buffer B per 10g of wet cells.
#Disrupt cells in a French press cell at a constant pressure of 20,000psi.'''This is about 140,000kPa.'''

'''Retaining the cell extract'''
#Centrifuge the crude lysate at 30,000RCF for 30min at 4°C.
#Carefully remove the top layer of the supernatant (lipid layer) and the pellet and centrifuge again.
#Shake the final supernatant at 100rpm.
#Gradually add 3ml of the pre-incubation solution to 10ml of the supernatant.
#Pre-incubate the supernatant with gentle shaking at 37°C for 80min. '''This degrades endogenous genetic content (DNA and mRNA).'''
#Dialyze the pre-incubated sample for 45min each at 4°C against 50 volumes of buffer B using a membrane with molecular weight cut-off of 10,000. Repeat the dialysis step three times.
#Centrifuge the retained extract at 4000RCF for 10min at 4°C to obtain the supernatant.
#Divide resulting S30 extract into small aliquots and store at -80°C.

''(Note: Protease inhibitors are added to pre-incubation solution to prevent degradation of proteins required for gene expression.)''

===Notes===
*Total time required: ~ 3 days.
*The protocol is based on [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T3C-4K242VK-1&_user=10&_coverDate=12%2F01%2F2006&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=fbf36c742708c667b5c4481856ca22b5 Simple procedures for the construction of a robust and cost-effective cell-free protein synthesis system] by Kim DM et al.
*Modifications to protocol:
**The original protocol uses creatine phosphate and creatine kinase instead of phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase.
**The original protocol does not use protease inhibitors in the pre-incubation solution.
