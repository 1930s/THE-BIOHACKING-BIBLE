==Objectives of the OHSU DNA R3 Club==
Cross-departmental workshop composed of students, postdocs, and faculty with shared interest in basic principles and emerging discoveries in DNA replication, recombination and repair. The goals of the meetings and this wiki:
* Establish a challenging and interactive cross-departmental focus group that will advance understanding of our individual projects and encourage collaborations.
*Provide students and postdocs with training and interactions with faculty interested in the R3 Topics

==R3 Activities==
Want to join us? All are invited!  

*All year. The third Tuesday of the month is the DNA repair videoconference for the [http://tango01.cit.nih.gov/sig/home.taf?_function=main&SIGInfo_SIGID=32 DNA Repair Interest Group at NIH]. NIH videoconference is held at 9:30 am in the CROET 2nd floor conference room (BSAC 2501M). 
*All year. Campus-wide Seminars of R3 Club interest are posted below. Please post your event or [[Special:Emailuser/Hoatlinm|email Maureen through OpenWetWare]] with any updates.

*Winter term: R3 Club meetings are scheduling now for 2008. More details later. 

*Spring Term: the R3 clubs folds into the weekly [http://openwetware.org/wiki/BMCB625 Advanced Biochemistry Class].
