I. Miniprepping DNA
*Background Information:
**method for separating plasmid DNA from other cellular components (chromosomal DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids)
**need to do a number of things in any miniprep protocol
***lyse cells (heat, sonication, detergents) (and remove RNA)
***precipitate proteins/chromosomal DNA/lipids
***concentrate (by column or precipitation) miniprepped DNA
***wash miniprepped DNA (removes salts)
***resuspend in useful buffer (water, TE)
*Exercise:  
**purify plasmid DNA (BioBrick type) using Qiagen spin column kit


II. Making/Pouring agarose gels
*Background Information:
**agarose is derived from seaweed
**solubilizes when heated (in buffer), then polymerizes upon cooling 
**forms a matrix with "pores" through which nucleic acids can travel
***altering concentration of agarose in gel changes size of pores and resolution of gel (lower agarose concentration best for separation of larger molecules)
***1% (weight/volume) gel = 1 gram of agarose/100 mL of buffer 
**Use Ethidium bromide (slides between bases of nucleic acids, fluorescent when exposed to UV light) to visualize DNA on gel
***can add to gel before pouring, or use in buffer
**Buffer needed to make and run gel-->want to use the same buffer for both making and running gel-->we used TAE (Tris, acetate, EDTA)
**"Comb" used to create "wells" (place to load samples)
*Exercise:  
**make and pour 1% agarose gel (50 mL volume)


III. Restriction Enzymes/Restriction digests
*Background Information:
**Restriction enzymes are the bacterial cell "immune system"—protect cells from invaders (viruses)
**REs cut at specific places within specific sequences-->most useful in molecular biology are Type II enzymes (which have palindromic recognition sites). 
**Cutting can leave "sticky ends" (DNA overhangs that can basepair with other, complementary overhangs) or "blunt" ends (no overhangs)
** Action of RE is to break the phosphodiester bond joining two nucleotides in a DNA sequence--> action of enzyme leaves a 3' OH and 5' P that can be rejoined in a "ligation" reaction
**RE, like all proteins, work in specific reaction conditions:
***need buffer with proper salt concentrations and Mg+2
***need DNA substrate
***need enzyme (<10% of total volume)
***need water
**usually do 20 µL reactions for 30 minutes-1 hour for complete digestion (with excess enzyme)
**Addition order is critical—want to always add enzyme last (enzymes are fragile, need to be kept properly folded to be functional)
*Exercise:
**Gave students plasmid pSB1A3 (NK and KBS knew this was BioBrick vector of 2157 bp + ~900 bp insert),the RE enzymes EcoRI, SpeI, and PstI, and NEB2 (compatible buffer for all three REs).  
**Had students set up single digests with EcoRI and one of the other two, then the double digest (EcoRI/SpeI or EcoRI/PstI)-->ran for 60 minutes @ 37˚C
** Students' job was to determine the size of the insert after running on agarose gel
**Also would be used for purification of DNA from agarose/ligations/transformations later in the week
