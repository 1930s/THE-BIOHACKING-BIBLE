#What is a BioBrick&trade; standard biological part?
#*A BioBrick&trade; standard biological part is a standard biological part that meets the technical and legal standards set forth by the BioBricks&trade; Foundation (BBF).  Each distinct BioBrick&trade; standard biological part is a nucleic acid-encoded molecular biological function (e.g., turn on/off gene expression), along with the associated information defining and describing the part. 
#How does the BioBricks&trade; Foundation define technical and legal standards for BioBrick&trade; standard biological parts?
#*The BBF works to define and improve the technical and legal standards that describe and enable use of BioBrick&trade; standard biological parts.  The BBF organizes workshops to discuss the technical and legal standards underlying BioBrick&trade; standard biological parts.  BBF members are encouraged to participate in this work.  Non-members are welcome to attend standards workshops (and, as interested, are encouraged to join the BBF!). 
#What is the significance to the &trade; symbol (e.g., BioBrick&trade; standard biological parts)?
#*A "biobrick" is a type (brand) of standard biological part.  The words "biobricks" and "biobrick" are adjectives, not nouns.  The BBF maintains the "biobrick(s)" trademarks in order to enable and defend the set of BioBrick&trade; standard biological parts as an open and free-to-use collection of standard biological parts.
