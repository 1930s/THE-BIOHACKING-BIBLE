==I2056==
*Heat shocked overnight digest w/ Mfe1 and Nsi1
*PCR cleaned
*Ligated into 1AK3
*Transformed 3ul of ligation and plated
*Was going to ligate into 3K3 also but ran out of 3K3 cut E/P

==T9002==
*Heat Shocked overnight E0240 digest w/ Spe1 and Nsi1
*PCR cleaned E0240
*Ligated F2620-3K3 (2 samples) and F2620-1AK3
*Transformed 3ul of each ligation and plated

==Plasmids==
*Minipreped overnight of 1AK3
*Digesting 1 sample with Eco and Pst and the other with Eco and Xba
*Digesting 3K3 w/ Eco and Pst overnight
*Also made an overnight of 3K3 from registry plate b/c ran out of uncut DNA too

==PCR==
[[Image:07-25.jpg|thumb|left|Gel from 7-25]]
*Diluted P1010_Xba_R, P1010_Eco_F, P1010_Spe_F, I2055_Promoter, E0240_R to 40uM
*Set up 1 100ul P1010 w/ Eco FWD and Xba REV
*Set up 1 100ul P1010 w/ Spe FWD and Xba REV
*Set up 1 100ul I2055 (new I2055_Promoter FWD and new E0240_R)
*All rxn involve supermix and are at 53
*Ran Gel loaded: lad, sp, I2055, ccdb-e/x, ccdb-s/x
**Slightly blurry but all look the right size - CCDB's around 700 and I2055 around 1kb
*Set up 24 overnight colony PCR's of I2055-3K3

==Digests==
*Set up an overnight double digest of I2055 with Mfe1 and Nsi1 in buffer 2
*Overnight double digest of P1010 w/ Eco and Xba tails cut E/X
*Overnight double digest P1010 w/ Spe and Xba tails cut S/X
