===Things to do===
*Harvard strain depository --look into it.
*Order ToxR today -- Jen
*Protein engineering biobricks -- Will
*Protein design scFv FecA -- Annie
*Get vector from TK. We need a clean miniprep to do this.
*Schematic for FecA, ToxR -- Jenny


*Synthesis
**To Do: design primers today for initial run of tests, Order.

==State of our Experiments==

Experiment 1: ToxR & CI
#anti fluorescin scFvs: specified on registry, have plasmid -> make primers, order from BH?
#ToxR/cI fusion: haven't been able to get cells from Mekalanos lab. ToxR and cI both specified, cI not by us. 
#*figure out if we can use biobricked cI
#*can we get ToxR somewhere else?
#MalE/PhoA: can get from e. coli genome: if we're sure we want it, design primers.
#fluorescin oligos: someone needs to work with TK to obtain primers with fluor. molecules and do PCR to get linked oligos. 
#strains AH5.5 & AH5.9: got em!

Experiment 2: ToxR & ctx
#see above for scFvs, MalE/PhoA, f-oligos, ToxR
#ctx: specified, to be ordered from BH. Can we get it somewhere to biobrick ourselves?
#decide what strain to do this in.

Experiment 3: FecA
#need to figure out precise experiments.
#FecA sequence not specified yet, because of some discrepancies that require resolution.
#question to be answered asap:
#*where to fuse, based on geometry of protein. Probably will do in numerous places.
#*what are the sequences? 
#<b>Help from advisors?</b> how do B/T cells respond? 
#get Fec- cells?

Experiment 4: Transmembrane fusion of IMP and OMP:
#Looking into a few more proteins (TolC, AcrA).

Experiment Future:
#need to biobrick anti-rabbit scFv
