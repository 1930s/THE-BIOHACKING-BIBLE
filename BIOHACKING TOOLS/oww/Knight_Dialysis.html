==Purpose==
To change buffers in which your protein resides.

<font color=red>Note that although this method should work, I find that I lose my protein using this approach.  Try [[Knight:Centrifuge desalting]] instead.</font>

==Materials==
*Slide-A-Lyzer MINI Dialysis Unit from Pierce ([http://www.piercenet.com/dialysis/mini.html video],  [http://www.piercenet.com/files/0803as4.pdf manual], [http://www.piercenet.com/products/browse.cfm?fldID=04010165 product page], [http://www.piercenet.com/Objects/View.cfm?type=Page&ID=85F6FD92-10E3-495B-A256-52CAA7E93C27#Products applications guide])
**''In general, the molecular weight cutoff for your column should be about half the molecular weight of your protein of interest.''
*dialysate (i.e. destination buffer)

==Procedure==
#Wear gloves to prevent contamination.
#'''Optional:''' to remove contaminating glycerol from the dialysis unit, dialyze the unit in 1L of DI water for 15 mins.  (Glycerol content: <3% in 3K, ~15% in 7K and ~23% in 10K MINI)
#'''Optional:''' to remove contaminating metals, dialyze 15 minutes against 1 L 1 mM EDTA.  (Metals present in a 3K, 7K or 10K MINI; 2 ppb iron, 5 ppb magnesium, 1.5 ppb nickel, 0.2 ppb zinc, 0.2 ppb copper, 0.5 ppb chromium and 0.3 ppb cadmium)
#Apply sample with a standard pipette.
#*''Sample volume should be between 10-100 &mu;L.''
#Cap the dialysis unit and place in a floatation device.
#Add 0.5-1L of dialysate to beaker.
#Add stir bar.  
#Place the beaker in ice or in a cold room and on a stir plate.
#Place the float with dialysis unit in the beaker so that the bottom of the dialysis unit is in contact with the dialysate.
#*''The volume level of the sample should be higher than the dialysate to avoid hydrostatic pressure forcing dialysate into the unit (thereby diluting the sample).''
#Use a low speed setting on the stir plate to avoid submerging the unit.
#Equilibrate for 2 hours.
#Collect the sample from the corner of the Slide-A-Lyzer unit.
