I am graduate research student at [http://serc.iisc.ernet.in/ SERC], working on Protein-Ligand docking under supervision of [[Nagasuma Chandra|Dr. Nagasuma Chandra]]. You can find some more information on [http://ssl.serc.iisc.ernet.in/~kalidas My Homepage].

==Currently working on==
#Structural biology.
##Fast methods for virtual screening.
##Improved methods for docking.
#Virtual Cell

==Publications==
I would like to have many [:-))

==About me==
#10th Class: R.K High school, Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, India. (1996)
#Intermediate: Ratnam college, Nellore. (1997-1998)
#B.Tech: Computer science and Engg., Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupathi. (1998-2002)
#Worked for 1 year 8 months in TCS, Bangalore after B.Tech. (2002-2004)
#Joined IISc as M.Sc(Engg) student in SERC in yr.2004 and now converted for a PhD in the same field
#I have applied for convertion to PhD under supervision of Dr. Nagasuma Chandra.

===In this field I am fond of===
#Developing biological instruments for dealing computationally very complex problems.
#Understand biological reason for what is ''Perfect peace''.

===Generally what I like to spend anxious moments on===
*Till now... Mathematics-differential calculus, geometry, writing poems, watching cricket... like that.
*But who would not like peace of mind to be true!!
