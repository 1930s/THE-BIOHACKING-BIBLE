===Quartz cuvettes for CD===
For our old spectrophotometer, we had two macrocell QS quartz cuvettes and two microcell QS quartz cuvettes.  I tested the quality of these four cuvettes for the purposes of CD (circular dichroism) using the [http://csbi.mit.edu/biophysinstrument/cdspectrometer CD spectrometer] at the [http://csbi.mit.edu/biophysinstrument/ Bioinstrumentation facility].  The two microcell cuvettes were not suitable for CD ... they have high birefringence.  The two macrocell cuvettes were suitable for CD in the wavelenth range 224-320nm.  However, for protein structures like alpha helices, you'll likely want to check the spectra even at 200nm.  So these cuvettes are not great for this purpose.  A cuvette for use in CD was purchased.
