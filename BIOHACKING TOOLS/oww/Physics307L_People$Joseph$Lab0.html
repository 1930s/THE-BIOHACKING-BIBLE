==Oscilloscope Lab Summary==

  
'''Summary'''

I learned about how to use an oscilloscope setup via computer.  I made mistakes in the setup and learned how to fix them.  I analyzed some (arbitrary) data using the tools I had available.

'''Descent'''

I recorded an average fall time of about 51 ms.  I measured this by analyzing the time it took for the voltage to drop to 10%.  This data was all gathered form the oscilloscope.  I'm not sure what error bars are or how I would show them...

'''Enhancement'''

Everything I know about an oscilloscope I learned from that lab.  I have an idea of how they work, what the measure, how they measure it, and how to manipulate the oscilloscope to get what you would like out of it.  I still don't know all of the features of the oscilloscope, but I'm sure if I used them one more often, everything would fall into line. 

'''Expedition'''

I played with the frequency and range quite a bit, and generated some very interesting oscillations that I showed to Devon.  I don't remember exactly how I did it, but thats part of the fun about learning to use new devices.

'''Improvement'''

Making the lab better could be done in a few simple ways:
* Standardize equipment.  If everyone is using the same instruments, its easier to resolve issues between the students.  
* Let us set up everything.  Everyone starting from the same line allows us to spend a  little more time figuring out how you'd set up the device.  I don't imagine in a real lab everything is set out and up for you.  Doing some of the initial grind work is often very beneficial.
