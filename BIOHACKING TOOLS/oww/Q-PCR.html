'''Quantitative PCR''' (Q-PCR or qPCR) is a [[PCR techniques|PCR technique]] used to quantify starting amounts of DNA template.  Amounts can be measured either at the end of the PCR (end-point assay) or during the PCR steps ([[Real-time PCR|real-time PCR]]).  Today [[Real-time PCR|real-time PCR]] is more commonly used because it can be more precise.

Frequently, quantitative PCR is used to measure RNA instead of DNA levels. To do this, [[RNA extraction|isolated RNA]] is reverse transcribed into cDNA.  Then quantitative PCR is run on the cDNA sample.  This sub-technique is called quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR ([[qRT-PCR]]) or even longer names.
