If you are interested in doing CHiP chip with Drosophila then please feel free to contribute to the protocols found here.  The original protocol was added and adapted with permission from [http://www.pdn.cam.ac.uk/staff/white/ Rob White's] lab.  You can download the original from [http://www.flychip.org.uk/protocols www.FlyChip.org.uk]

'''Important''':  This protocol is dynamic, feel free to discuss any stages and make changes as you see fit.  If you use are currently using this protocol in the lab then it is important that you make a note of the date of the version that you are using and return to this if you need to repeat the experiment.
