Social activities and events organized through the Undergraduate Student Board provide an opportunity for students in different phases of their undergraduate careers to interact and relax in the midst life at MIT.

==Department Socials==
Every once in a while (about once a semester), the BE department hosts a large social event for all faculty, students, and staff.  Traditions have included a Fall BBQ, a late-summer ChemE/BE BBQ, a spring BE sports picnic with student-faculty softball, croquet, bocce..., and many more.
