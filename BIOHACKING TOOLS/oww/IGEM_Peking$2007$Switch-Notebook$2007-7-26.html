===Colony PCR test of lacZa-pLX007/8/9===
* Primers: test_F_new, test_R

30 colonies are tested for each of lacZa-pLX007/8/9, 2 self connections are used as control. 96 in total.

延伸45s, 退火60C, 25 cycles.

Only lacZa-pLX009(20) is right. lacZa-pLX008 is probably right, but the size seems wrong. Both are incubated at 2pm.

===PCR of CD2/3 from CD1-pMD18-T===
CD2 is retracted. CD3 failed.

===PCR of lacZa===
Retracted.

===Ligation and transformation of CD2-pMD18-T===

===Single digestion of pLX007/8/9 with SalI or XhoI===
SalI is OK. XhoI can not digest the plasmid.
