== Education and Research ==

Graduated in Applied Physics from the [http://www.ist.pt Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico] in Lisbon, Portugal. My main experience in research has been on designing and measuring noise of spin-valve magnetic sensors at [http://www.inesc-mn.pt INESC-MN], in Lisbon. Prior to coming to MIT I worked for almost a year at [http://www.natural-works.com Natural Works], a company that does engineering and consultancy in the field of Building Physics. What does this have to do with Biological Engineering? Almost nothing! Except that at INESC-MN, magnetic based biosensors were being developed and I came to like them! I was also briefly linked to a (not yet) start-up company named Haloris Nanotechnologies, in Portugal.

At the moment, my main interests are micro and nanotechnologies applied to biology for developing integrated biosensors.


== Personal ==

My likes are mainly traveling, eating, hiking, reading and watching films and TV series (though not at the US, because there are just too many commercials too often!), but I can't summarize everything here.
I love wandering around the streets of Lisbon and it is one of my goals here at the US to make as many people as possible addicted to this city. Although I won't be able to subsidize trips, I may be able to help with accommodation!
For six years I was a member of the direction of a youth cultural organization in Cascais, Portugal that promoted many cultural activities  (such as concert, workshops, forums and sports) for the local community. Back home I occasionally practiced orienteering.
