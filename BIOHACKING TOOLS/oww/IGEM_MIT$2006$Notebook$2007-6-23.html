'''Results from extraction experiment yesterday'''

One extraction was 300% efficient somehow, which could have been a result of it being 100 ppm concentration (a relatively high concentration.  For fear that I would break the machine at 200 ppm, I did not run that sample.  The rest of the samples were pretty consistently at around 30%.  This is very frustrating.  I will repeat the experiment again some time.
