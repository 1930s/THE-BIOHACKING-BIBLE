#Streak cells on LB plate
#Grow overnight at 37°C
===<font color="green">Competent Cells: Day 1 (optional)</font>===
#Inoculate overnight starter culture (2 mL) w/ colony from plate
===<font color="green">Competent Cells: Day 2</font>===
#Inoculate 80 mL<sup>2</sup> with appropriate amount of O’N to obtain OD6000~0.1.  Place cells on ice at OD600=0.375 (do not allow growth past an OD of 0.4, as this decreases subsequent transformation efficiency).  Typically this will take 40-60 min (check every 5 min when OD is getting near 0.375).  
#Ice for 10 min.
#Transfer to a pre-chilled centrifuge tube (40mL) and spin at 1600g/7 min/0°C/no brake in small, cold rotor.
#Decant supernatant & gently resuspend pellet in 8 mL of ice-cold CaCl2 buffer.
#Spin 1100g/5 min/0°C.  
#Gently resuspend pellet in 8 mL ice-cold CaCl2.  Let stand on ice for 30 min.
#Spin 1100g/5 min/0°C.  Decant supernatant & resuspend <u>''well''</u> in 1.6 mL ice-cold CaCl2.  Cells may stand on ice for 12-24 hrs to increase competency.  
#Swirl tube(s) to mix, & aliquot 50 μL into cold eppendorfs.  Immerse immediately in crushed dry ice.
#Transfer to box(es) and store in -80°C freezer (downstairs on 2nd floor).




<sup>1</sup>CaCl2(per L)

*0.19 g KCl
*Adjust to pH 7.0 w/ NaOH
*Autoclave
*Add filter-sterilized MgCl2, MgSO4 solution to give final Mg2+ conc. of 20 mM (i.e. 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MgSO4)

='''Restrictions'''=
''Time: 20 min''

''Reference: NEB.com''

===<font color="red">Pre</font>=== 
*(optional) Determine plasmid concentration via A260 measurements or by comparing intensities of bands on gel with those of the ladder DNA (whose masses are known).   
===<font color="green">Restricting</font color>===
#To an eppendorf tube, add:
##Appropriate volume of plasmid for a total of approx. 700 ng DNA (usually, if plasmid prep is good, this will be 2 μL (i.e. ~350 ng/ μL)).
##1 μL of appropriate 10X concentration buffer (to determine correct buffer check compatibility of restriction buffers using NEB catalogue or going online to NEB.com)
##If necessary (i.e. check NEB), add 1 μL 10X concentration BSA
##[x] μL of dH2O to make the total reaction volume in tube of 10 μL.
##Chosen restriction enzymes.  They are at a high enough concentration that 0.5 μL of each is more than sufficient for a restriction digest.  ALWAYS ADD THESE LAST (and work quickly), in order to minimize time out of the freezer.  Keep these enzymes in their low-temp blue carrying case when out of the freezer.
#(gingerly) flick tubes, and spin down in microcentrifuge for a second
#Incubate at 37°C (in water bath or warm room) for 2-16 hrs. (3-4 hrs. optimal) 
#(under review)...treat any vectors w/0.2 μL CIP and incubate for 30 min at 37°C with rest of restrictions


='''Ligation'''=
''Time: 15 min''

''Reference: NEB T4 ligase technical bulletin
http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/TechBulletinFiles/techbulletinM0202.pdf''

===<font color="red">Pre</font>=== 
*Estimate DNA concentration of restricted fragments.  Aim for a 3:1 insert:vector molar ratio.   
===<font color="green">Ligation</font color>===
#for 20 μL reaction volume, to eppendorf add:

where x is usually 5-15 uL, y=[1,5] uL.

Also, always remember to do a negative control, which will be like the reaction above, but w/ no insert.  Your transformation plates will then be an measure of any vector re-ligation/uncut background.  

2. For overnight ligation, add ice to cold water in styrofoam container to bring temp to 12-14ºC.  Incubate overnight (15 hr.).  Alternatively, for quicker ligation, ligate at RT for 1 hr.  Proceed directly to transformation.
