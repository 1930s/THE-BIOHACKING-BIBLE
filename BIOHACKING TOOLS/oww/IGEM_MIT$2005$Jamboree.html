The end-of-competition '''JAMBOREE''' will take place during the first weekend of November here in Cambridge, MA.  

The exact schedule is still TBD but plan to reserve the entire weekend of November 5-6, 2005.

In order to present our system at the Jamboree we will need to meet two submission requirements:
*All parts used in our system entered into the Registry and documented such that somebody else could re-use the part later.
*A web-page summary and description of the system.  See the IAP 2004 project pages for some first-generation examples.  We can do a lot better than this.
