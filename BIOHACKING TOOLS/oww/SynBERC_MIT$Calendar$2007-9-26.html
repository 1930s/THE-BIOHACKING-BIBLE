==Topic of discussion==
Paul Oldham from Lancaster University - Synthetic Biology: Interrogating the Patent Landscape

*[http://www.epo.org/focus/patent-system/scenarios-for-the-future.html European Patent Office - Scenarios for the Future] - [http://documents.epo.org/projects/babylon/eponet.nsf/0/63A726D28B589B5BC12572DB00597683/$File/EPO_scenarios_bookmarked.pdf download the pdf]
*International patent classification scheme (there is also a U.S. patent classification scheme) - this can help in searching the patent literature
*There is no classification code for genomics, proteomics, or synthetic biology.
*The Thomson Corporation are the main player in the commercial software for full-text patent searching.
*[http://www.google.com/patents Google] is doing a pretty good job of enabling search of the U.S. patent database.  But they haven't yet released anything for European patents.  -TK
*Searches of the patent literature requires a lot of cleaning.  "Synthetic cell" can yield results on underwear for example.
*Thomson's Micropatent Aureka Gold service allows construction of "patent landscapes".  It clusters based of frequency of appearance of a set of stock terms.  
*What are the terms that define synthetic biology?
*Patent citation searching; Top cited patents are cited heavily because either the invention is very novel or because the claims are very broad.  This might be a useful way of searching the patent literature.
*Some companies have enormous numbers of patents - they can drown out companies with small numbers of patents that may be of interest.
*Patents are a trailing indicator ... they tend to come 3 years later.  What are the leading indicators - information on the web or publications?  Perhaps patent applications?

#How do I find patents I care about? - Jason
#*getting the right set of search terms is really hard ... pretty easy to go too narrow or too broad
#Institute a broad search, then send those to a committee that decides whether that patent is synthetic biology or not (distributed network of folks) and classifies it. - TK
#Then you have to decide how to respond to overly broad patents. - Ken
#Then patent trolls have incentive to avoid getting flagged in the search process. - Ken
#*You can partially find these folks by looking at conference attendee lists etc.
#What would patent trolls go after?

*Just because a patent exists, doesn't mean that it is valid or enforceable.
*It would be nice to search patented protein and DNA sequences. - Melina 
*All patented sequences are in Genbank but there may not be a way to limit your search to patented sequences. - TK
