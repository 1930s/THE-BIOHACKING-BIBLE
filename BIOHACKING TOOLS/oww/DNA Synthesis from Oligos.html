== Overview ==
Despite claims by Synthesis companies for cheap gene/DNA synthesis, there are times when manual synthesis is necessary. This can be done relatively easily by ordering the necessary oligos of both strands, and a bit of ligation cycling. 

== Procedure ==
* Design oligos for your gene, of both strands. Either make them fixed 30-mers, with 15-mer overlaps, or use the software by Rouillard et al. referenced below.
* Dilute the oligos to 100uM.
* Kinase the oligos.
* Ligation cycle:
** For Thermostable Taq ligase, cycle between 95C (denature), 45-55C (anneal), and 65C (ligate). Do many as necessary (10-30).
** For T4 ligase, cycle between 95C (denature, 15 sec), 45-55C (anneal, 30 sec), and 20C (ligate). Do about 5-10 cycles, add bit more ligase, and ATP, do 5-10 more cycles .
* Clean up.
* Rescue PCR with end primers, using ligation cycling product as template.
* Gel extract.
* T-vector or TOPO clone.

== Notes ==
This works well for relatively for short fragments (300-500 bp). For longer sequences, use [[PCR Overlap Extension]] of the fragments.
