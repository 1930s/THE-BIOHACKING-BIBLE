#Overnight culture in 10 mL LB, fresh colony.
#Dilute 1:100 in 500 mL LB, grow to OD .4-.5, takes between 2-3 hours.  Shake on ice to stop the growth before spin.
#Spin in prechilled bottle at 3500rpm for 15min.
#Do the rest in the cold room or on ice bucket: resuspend in 25-50mL ICE-COLD TSS with prechilled pippette.<br>
