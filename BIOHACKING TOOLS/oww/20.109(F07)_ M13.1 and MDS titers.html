{{Template: 20.109(F07)}}
All data on this page was collected by the MIT's Biological Engineering undergraduate students in the Fall 2007 as part of a laboratory class, 20.109. It represents the culmination of an ambitious [[20.109(F07): M13.1| phage redesign project]] that began at the start of the term. Redesigned phage were tested for phage titers on a "complete" E. coli genome (MG1655), and on the indicated MDS, described in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=16645050&ordinalpos=2&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum]

*Any notes about titers presented here: did not do a no phage control, M13K07 not grown at same time as other, some TA unevenly spread so uncertain if plaques could be seen.
