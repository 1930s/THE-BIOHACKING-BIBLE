#Constitutive promoter for LacI: which strains have it?
  -R0053 from p22 cII 
  -R0040 from TetR
  -Z0251 from T7 
 R0040 is stronger than R0053.

:Summary: contains the sequence for LacI, the CAP binding site, lacI repressor binding site. There are variation in the sequence between different strains. A hard copy of the sequence is in the iGEM binder (it's red and kept by Annie).

*cI and cro are adjacent on the lambda chromosome and transcribed in opposite directions (divergently).
*cI promoter = Prm points polymerase leftward.
**Both promoters do not overlap.

==Experiments==
*The production of lacI
:-Components: constitutive promoter, RBS + gene sequence + terminator of LacI gene
:-Test constructs: 
#assemble R0053 + E0040 (GFP) or E0433 (LacZ delta m15 bacterial strain) 
#assemble R0040 + E0040 (GFP) or E0433 (LacZ delta m15 bacterial strain)
#assemble Z0251 + E0040 (GFP) or E0433 (LacZ delta m15 bacterial strain)

     
#assemble R0053 + P0412 (LacI gene)
#assemble R0040 + P0412 (LacI gene)
#assemble Z0251 + P0412 (LacI gene)
:-Measurements:
  Qualitative - 
  Quantitative - 

*The production of cI/TetR
:-Components: CAP binding site, promoter regulated by LacI, RBS + gene sequence + terminator of cI/TetR gene
:-Test contructs: 
#R0010 + E0040 (GFP) or E0433 (LacZ delta m15 bacterial strain)
#R0010 + P0451 (cI without a cI regulated promoter)
#R0010 + Q04510 + E0040/E0433 (Q04510 is cI with a cI regulated promoter)


#R0010 + P0440 (TetR without a TetR regulated promoter)
#R0010 + Q04400 + E0040/E0433 (Q04400 is TetR with a TetR regulated promoter)
