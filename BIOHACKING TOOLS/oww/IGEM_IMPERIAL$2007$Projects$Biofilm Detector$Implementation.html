==Experiments in ''E. coli''==
Our initial aim is to test our simple systems in the ''E. coli'' chassis.  ''E.coli'' is a well defined chassis in which most system function. This first phase of experimentation is to ensure that our system works.

==''Experiment 1''==
===Test for AHL Sensitivity===
'''Detector system:''' Chassis: ''E. coli'', DNA: pLux without hrp system, Reporter: GFP<br>
'''Signaling system:''' AHL induced<br>
The sensitivity of the system is to be determined through this experiment. To do this, we induce ''E. coli'' cells transfected with the construct with known concentrations of HSL. We then record the change in GFP, such that we can calculate the rate of GFP production relative to concentration of AHL in solution.<br>
'''Aims:'''
*To determine the rate of change of protein production relative to concentration of AHL
*To determine the response time relative to concentration of AHL
*To determine the steady state response of protein relative to concentration of AHL

=====Variables and Controls=====
{{hide|
*Independent variable: [AHL] 
**Range: 0 - 200nM 
**Steps/Intervals: 10nM

**Sampling intervals: 
**#5min over first 40min 
**#10min thereafter 
*Repetitions of experiment(n): 5 
*Predicted length of experiment: 4 days
*'''''Status''': Scheduled for 9th August''

=====Protocol=====
{{hide|
'''Day 1:'''
#Transform plasmid into cells using electroporation
#Grow in 0.5 ml LB for 1 hour
#Plate on ampicillin plate and leave overnight at 37&deg;C with shaking

'''Day 2:'''
#Make 8 of 5 ml LB medium with 5 &micro;l ampicillin in sterile tubes
#Pick 8 colonies and innoculate in tubes
#Leave overnight at 37&deg;C with shaking

'''Day 3:'''
#Make 5 of 550 ml LB medium with 550 &micro;l ampicillin in sterile conical flask 
#Innoculate in 5 cultures into the the conical flasks
#Leave overnight at 37&deg;C with shaking

'''Day 4:'''
#Prepare a water bath at 30&deg;C '''[should we use a shaking incubator?]'''
#Aliquot the 550 ml cultures into sterile tubes, 25 ml per tube
#Add 53.3075 ng AHL each time to increase [AHL] in steps of 10nM 
#Begin the timer when AHL is added
#At 5 minute intervals for the first 40 minutes, and 10 minute intervals thereafter:
##Sample a 1 ml of the reaction mixture 
##Immediately chill in ice (to slow the rate of reaction)
##Centrifuge at maximum speed for 30 seconds to pellet the cells
##Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1ml distilled water 
##Put in a spectrometer and excite it at 501nm and detect at 511nm<br>[Note: Use solution at 0 minutes as a blank, assume no fluorescence is present prior to activation]
#These measurements should be repeated with the other 4 cultures of bacteria

===Test for temperature Sensitivity===
'''Detector system:''' Chassis: ''E. coli'', DNA: pLux without hrp system, Reporter: GFP<br>
'''Signaling system:''' AHL induced<br>
We then need to determine the response of system at different temperatures, allowing us to find out the optimal temperature for the system. This experiment will be similar to the previous one, except with a varying temperature, while maintaining a constant AHL level. The AHL level chosen will be ideally at the concentrations of AHL which the lux promoter is most sensitive to.
<br>'''Aims:'''
*To determine the general effect of temperature on the system and determine the optimal temperature

===Test for temperature dependence of the lifespan===
'''Detector system:''' Chassis: ''E. coli'', DNA: pLux without hrp system, Reporter: GFP<br>
'''Signaling system:''' AHL induced<br>
<br>The system must be stable for long periods of time before use. Temperature would be one of the leading factors limiting the shelf life of the system. We therefore want to determine the effect of temperature on the lifespan of the system. The system will be left at a constant temperature for several days. The decline in response time and strength over the days will be measured, through which we hope to determine the shelf-life and optimal storage temperature of the system.
<br>'''Aims:'''
*To determine effects of temperature on the robustness of the system (response time and strength)
