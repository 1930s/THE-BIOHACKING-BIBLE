==2:30pm Meeting with Dr. David Leak about the chemostat==

*It seems promising to use the chemostat for our purposes
**Fresh media has to be supplied constantly
**Cell growth could be controlled by enriching LB media with glucose and monitor the amount of glucose
**pH and other parameters can be controlled easily using the chemostat
**Samples of the liquid medium can be taken throughout the experiment
*We need to wait for James, who is responsible for monitoring the lab and chemostat, to get back from holidays
*Charge for the chemostat: Â£5 per day

==5:30pm Meeting with Pierre Mielot on a general pH sensor==
