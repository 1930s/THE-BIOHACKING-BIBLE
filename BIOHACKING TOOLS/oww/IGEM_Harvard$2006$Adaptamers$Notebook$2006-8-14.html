===7/14===                                                                      
                                                                                
Went to Dr. Shih's lab and picked up carboxy-terminated magnetic and            
polystyrene beads in addition to EDC (used in the protein-coupling              
reaction), NHS (used in two-step protein-coupling reaction), and AMF            
( or FAM = aminomethylfluorescein ) to use in a control experiment. Did         
not run control experiment due to lack of MES.
