I am a graduate student at Harvard and currently teaching synthetic biology in MCB100.  
My interests involve the social implications of synthetic biology and the applications of synthetic biology to mammalian systems.

I co-teach a course with Jon Beckwith, Roberto Kolter & Louis Guenin on the Social Issues in Biology.
