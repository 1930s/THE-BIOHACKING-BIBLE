==quick gel purifcation==
according to ''Transgen'' kit protocol
#Agarose gel electrophoresis,cut the DNA band as thin as possible.pute into a clear EP tube.weighing,if the weight is 100mg,the volume can be considered as 100uL,add solution GSB,put into 55C water bath until complently merge,it takes about 5 minutes
#cool the tube with water to adjust the tempertature of the solution to room temperature
#Add the solution into the collection tube, standing for 1 minute,13000rpm for 1 min, discard the flow-through
#Add 650 uL WB,13000rpm for 1 min,discard the flow-through
#13000rpm for 2 min,discard the flow-through
#Put the collection tube into a clean EP tube, Add 50 uL 60C ddH2O in the center of the collection tube,standing for 1 min
#13000rpm for 1 min.
#store the DNA solution at -20C
