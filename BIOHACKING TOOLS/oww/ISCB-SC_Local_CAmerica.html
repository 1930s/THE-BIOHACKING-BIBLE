==Collaboration with Students in Central America==
The Student Council has initiated talks to negotiate the creation of a
new regional network in Central America, led by Allan Orozco. Mr Orozco,
assistant lecturer at University in Costa Rica, has stressed the
abundance of biodiversity resources in the region, starting a campaign
involving major governmental funding bodies to enable the development of
computational biology in the region through ISCB-SC. Among the projects
currently discussed, it is of special interest to of a scientific event
in the area of San Jose (Costa Rica), which would bring together local
businesses, international corporations and renowned academic leaders.
"This year's ISMB being held in Brazil will be an outstanding
opportunity to get many students and businesses to boost the
computational biology field in Latin America", said Manuel Corpas, who
is acting as intermediary between the Student Council and the Central
American ISCB-SC Regional Network.
