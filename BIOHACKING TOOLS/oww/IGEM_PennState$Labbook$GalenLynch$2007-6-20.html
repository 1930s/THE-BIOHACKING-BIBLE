*Troubleshooting experiments
**bizarre negative control on enzyme assays suggest that some restriction occured
**all transformations failed
***Single unifying trait of expirements: amp
*Laboratory management
**Set up anhydrous containers for 100% ethanol and kanamycin
**Need to buy agarose for Dr.Richard's lab
**Began processing of switching to SYBR green instead of ethidium bromide
***SYBR is less mutagenic, may have better results, and would use dual purpose (GFP) filter
***Real time visualization
***No UV, less damage to DNA and safre to use
***Pre stain, less toxic, .3 cents per sample
*Lambda project
**Looked for part avaliability, explored lambda genome
