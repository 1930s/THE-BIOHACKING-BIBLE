Recombineering is a method where E-coli undergoes recombination between linear DNA, introduced through [[electroporation]], with circularized DNA already present within the cell.

This process is then adapted to E-coli strain DH10B, a Bacteria Artificial Chromosome (BAC)strain. This results in the original recombineering E-coli strain designated DY380 as well as other versions modified to include different selection mechanisms.
