==In Vitro Testing of pTet 25<sup>o</sup>C using Home-Made Cell Extract with Commercial Pre-Incubation Mix==
Tested for the viability of the home-made cell extract. 
<br><br>
Protocol followed was according to the Promega one, and can be found here under [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Experimental_Design/Phase1/Protocol_2.1|Phase 1-In vitro testing]] on the experimental design page.
<br><br>
Results: It was observed that no fluorescence was produced during the incubation period of over 4 hours. 


==In Vitro Testing of pTet 25<sup>o</sup>C using Home-Made Cell Extract and Reaction Buffer==
Tested for the viability of the home-made cell extract and reaction buffer. 
<br><br>
Protocol followed was according to the one in the paper.
<br><br>
Results: It was observed that no fluorescence was produced during the incubation period of over 4 hours.  



==Vesicles Formation with GFP==
'''Formation of Vesicles'''

Using POPC/dodecane suspension from [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Notebook/2007-8-23#Vesicles_Formation_with_GFP | the day before]], two samples were prepared:
* 2ml of suspension was taken to prepare an interface according to protocol.
* 250&mu;l of 100x diluted GFP solution was used to prepare the emulsion; stirred gently with magnetic stirrer.
* Special care was taken to protect the GFP solution from light at all times.

In addition, another suspension was prepared using Span-80 and mineral oil. The Span-80 was simply added to the mineral oil and mixed for 10 minutes with a magnetic stir bar before 250&mu;l of 100x diluted GFP solution was added to it.

3 samples prepared:
* Sample 1: 2ml of POPC/dodecane/GFP emulsion, with no previously prepared interface.
* Sample 2: 1ml of POPC/dodecane/GFP emulsion added over interface prepared with 2ml of POPC/dodecane suspension.
* Sample 3: 2ml of Span-80/mineral oil/GFP emulsion, with no previously prepared interface.

All samples were centrifuged at 120x g.

Samples from both the POPC/dodecane and Span-80/mineral oil emulsions were also collected for observation under the microscope.

'''Results'''
* Sample 1: Vesicles observed, but very sparse, with no fluorescence.
* Sample 2: Numerous small vesicles encapsulating GFP were observed.
* Sample 3: Vesicles observed, but with no fluorescence. Vesicles were very mobile.
* POPC/dodecane Emulsion: Fluorescent esicles observed, but very sparse.
* Span-80/mineral oil Emulsion: Numerous small vesicles encapsulating GFP were observed.
