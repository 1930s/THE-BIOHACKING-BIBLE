===Experiments===
====Initial testing:====
constructs tested in-vivo and in-vitro
*pTet - find out why doesn't work below 10&deg;C and above 45&deg;C
*pT7 - need to reclone (doesn't have the right RBS)
*pLux - doesn't work below 1nM

====Tests for working conditions:====
*'''ID:''' 
**Test on construct 1 carried out with various [AHL] - works for 3,5,7,10,50nM. Reaches steady state within about 3 and a 1/2 hours
**Carrying out purification of LuxR for construct 2
**Need to do a titration curve for different [AHL]

*'''CBD:''' Problems with results - steady state not reached within 8 hours (lab time). Tried staggering but miss the steady state - data not useful 
**Try for longer access to lab and fluorometer
**Get a 24hr fluorometer<br>

Also problem with data - fluorescence increases after overnight incubation

*'''dsRed express''' - vector should be cloned by next week

*'''Solution to GFP problem:'''
**Prioritise experiments with dsRed express
**Try to find purified GFP mut-3b
**dsRed2 to be cloned - in case other options don't work out

*'''Other problems with data:'''
**Mixing the samples - find out whether better to shake or not. Can't centrifuge as affects reaction
**Evaporation - oil to prevent it, but might stop O<sub>2</sub> supply too. Or can get a rate of evaporation for different temperatures and account for it using modelling

====Vesicles====
*Put in cell extract - fluorescence seen but may not be GFP, can be background fluorescence
**Need to do a control experiment - as not sure if expression actually heppening inside the vesicles (contact a Chem. engineer)
*A lot of fluorescence seen outside the vesicles
**Can be due to vesicles popping or GFP not actually getting into the vesicles
*Emulsion process - doesn't seem good enough to encapsulate the cell extract
**Characterise the process of emulsion - will take 3-4 days
*Vesicles seem quite stable - last for ~ 3 days
*Permeability - without it expression worse than in-vitro and signal really weak
**No permeability improves duriblity of DNA - 
**May only get non-permeable vesicles
*Will get measure of population activity rather than individual as not possible to characterise the size of the vesicles, even with the same protocols

====Modelling====
*Deterministic models complete
*Currently doing data analysis
**Programming a curve fitting program to extract parameters
**24hr experiments required to fully analyse data
**Need kinetic constants from data - currently a lot of assumptions

===Meeting with other teams===
*Vincent to sort out a meeting with Cambridge during term time

===Other===
*Registry - must only submit the parts actually being used in the project
*Have no name yet!
