==Equipments==
*Fluorometer + PC
*1 well plate
*Plate sticker lid
==Reagents==
*Pyruvate kinase
*rNTPs
*S30 cell extract (home made)
*Reaction buffer (home made)
*Commercial S30 cell extract
*Commercial Pre-incubation mix 
*Amino Acids 
**Minus Cysteine
**Minus Leucine
*pTet DNA plasmid

==Steps==
#Fill an eppendorf tube with two samples (56ul x 2) of home made cell extract including reaction buffer, pyruvate kinase and rNTPs.The volumes are shown below:
#*Home made S30 - 16.2ul
#*Reaction Buffer- 30ul
#*rNTP's - 1ul
#*Pyruvate Kinase - 3.1ul
#*DNA - 4ul
#*ddH<sub>2</sub> - 5.7ul
#Fill a second eppendorf tube with two samples (40ul x 2) of commercial cell extract including the amino acids mixture, and preincubation buffer.
#Place a quarter of each mixture in a well in the 96 well plate, making up 2 wells (B3 and B5). 
#In another well (C4), as a control, place another quarter of only the commercial cell extract, with 28ul of water.
#In the last well (D5), add a quarter of each mixture. This serves as the negative control.
#In the last well, add nuclease free water (again as a negative control).
# In wells B3, B5 and C4, add 20ul of DNA.
#Measure the fluorescence at 30 min intervals for the 1st hour, and hourly intervals thereafter.
#After each measurement, cover the plate with the sticky lid.
