'''Aminoglycosides''' are antibiotics effective against some bacteria. Note that aminoglycosides derived from ''Streptomyces'' species are named with the suffix ''-mycin'', while those derived from ''micromonospora'' are named with the suffix ''-micin''. (These antibiotics are misspelled frequently).

==Members common in the lab==
* [[gentamicin]]

* [[kanamycin]]
* [[neomycin]]
* [[streptomycin]]

* [[G418]] = geneticin

==Comparison==

Kanamycin and gentamycin affect bateria at lower concentrations than eukaryotes. Therefore, they can be used to target bacteria in animals during disease. G418 is more spefific for eukaryotic 80S ribosomal subunit and will harm cells without neo-resistence gene. G418 and kanamycin both work on bacteria but the latter is cheaper.
