*Prepared DNA samples for sequencing
**Quantified mini-prep DNA
***Samples I741011, I741018
**Made fresh SYBR green I 10x stock
***Disposed of old ones
*Last of I741015 and I741005 accidentally used in restrictions
**Since all composite parts were made with these particular colonies, it's necessary to salvage the DNA
**To reclaim DNA from restriction reaction: Denature EcoR1 at 65 C for 20 minutes, Ligate, and transform
