==Welcome to the Koch lab wiki!==
We are a research lab at the [http://www.unm.edu University of New Mexico], in the [http://www.chtm.unm.edu Center for High Technology Materials (CHTM)] and [http://panda.unm.edu Physics Department].  We are experimental biophysicists, which to us means we use our skills and talents as physical scientists to provide new answers for important questions in cellular and molecular biology.  For example, developing new techniques to probe protein-DNA interactions by unzipping single DNA molecules with optical tweezers.  You can learn more about our interests on our [[Koch_Lab:Research|Research]] page.
<br><br>
In addition, we are committed to being open scientists and sharing our results, methods, and ideas as quickly, clearly, and openly as possible.  However, being a very new lab, we are still learning how to do this and are well behind the curve set by others at [[Main_Page|OpenWetWare]].  Therefore, we welcome any requests for information or improvements to add to the wiki, see our [[Koch_Lab:Contact|Contact]] page.

[[User:Ramalldf|Ramalldf]] 14:59, 21 January 2008 (CST): Hey guys, this is Diego from the Koch lab. Dr. Koch and Dr. Lidke want to organize a group/journal club meeting for this semester and they would like as many people to attend as possible. Dr. Koch suggested 11 am on Fridays but he'd like to hear everyone's preferences so that we maximize participation. I'll send an email but could you please come back to this page, log on and post up what times work best for you all this semester ASAP? Thanks, I'll start: 

[[User:Ramalldf|Ramalldf]] 14:59, 21 January 2008 (CST): Friday 11am is good. Tuesday/Thursday in the morning are bad. 

[[User:Kalidke|Keith Lidke]] Friday 11 am is good. Prefer Not Mon,Wed.  Biophysics class is 5:30 MW, seminar is 4pm Th.

[[User:amanole|Nas Manole]] MWF: anytime but 11:00-3:00 TR: anytime before 11:00
