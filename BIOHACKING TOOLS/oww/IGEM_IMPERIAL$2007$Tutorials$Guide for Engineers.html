== Background ==

Engineers don't normally possess a detailed knowledge of biochemistry and cell biology. One of the challenges they face when entering the iGEM project is how to start learning about the biological concepts that are involved in synthetic biology. 

The aim of this guide is to give an overview of the applicable biological concepts that will be useful for engineers engaging in synthetic biology. It is compiled by the biologists of the iGEM team for the engineers in a hope that the reciprocal exchange of knowledge and expertise would greatly benefit the team in future brainstorming sessions and experimental design and planning.
