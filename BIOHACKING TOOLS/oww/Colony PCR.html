==General Information==

Colony PCR is can be used after a transformation to screen colonies for the desired plasmid.  Primers are used which generate a PCR product of known size.  Thus, any colonies which give rise to an amplification product of the expected size are likely to contain the correct DNA sequence.

==Specific Protocols==
*[[Endy:Colony PCR]]
*[[Knight:Colony PCR]]

==Notes==
#I have compared Taq and Vent using this reaction mix and found that Taq worked better. For very long amplicons, I would recommend using Phusion, which has its own reaction mix. I have not found a difference between Phusion and Taq on amplicons shorter than ~3kb.
