== Meeting with Tim Ham ==
* all reagents listed in paper are available
** inducible Fim and Hin
** many RBSs
** diff promoter systems
* none in biobrick format, but restriction sites are outside of what is important
** would start off by re-casting into biobricks - then can easily see what can do (take things out, leave things, move around) - test the limiting parameters
* single inversion works
* parts of double inversion don't work - not sure why
* Hin - part of a big family (Gin, etc.) - swappable - all have same core binding site
* Fim - native to E. coli - no other members in this family
** FimB - reversible
** FimE - inverts in one direction
* project idea - synthetic counters
** overlapping inversions like a latch (talk to Josh Gilmore from Keasling lab)
** problem is need at least 4 independent invertases - they don't exist - would have to engineer them so that they don't have cross-talk
** not clear how would screen or select for
* engineering Zn-finger binding domains
* read details of the 1st paper
