*Miniprep to check ligations from Friday
*A - 12D->24A->6B 2,1
*B - "" 1,3
*C - "" 2,2
*D - "" 1,2
*E - "" 1,4
*F - "" 1,6
*G - "" 1,5
*H - "" 2,3
*I - "" 1,1
*J - Riboswitch ->12D->24A 8 (via PCR)
*K - "" 1(via PCR)

*X - "" 7
*Y - "" 9
*Z - "" 8
*AA - "" 10
*Some confirmed successful
*Recultured A, R, T, and W (?) for maxiprep tomorrow

==Ligation==
*Redo ligation 12D->2H
*In digestion, saw two bands, cut them both out and have tried both of them
*We'll see which one gives the better result (hopefully the correct result)
*Ligation was left overnight
*In glass milk purification, did not do the second 65C step, hopefully will not affect results
*Electroporation tomorrow morning

==Screening stage 2 ligations by PCR==
*The 27 colonies above were additionally screened by PCR
*For PCR: 
**"Mastermix" of 100ul for each of the three ligations:
***47uL MiliQ
***20uL MgCl2 (25mM)
***10uL Taq buffer (NH4)2SO4-MgCl2
***5uL dNTP mix (10mM)
***2uL Primer I  (for primers used see below)
***2uL Primer II
***2uL Taq Polymerase

*Distribute 9uL of "mastermix" into 0.2mL eppendorf tubes 
*Add 1uL DNA template (from cultured colonies)

''Sets of Primers that we used: <br>''
'''1.) Ligations A-I:'''
*pSB1(A2/A3/AK3)    Tm = 56.8 C
*I13504            Tm = 51.9 C

'''2.) Ligations J-Q:'''
*Riboswitch Primer Tm = 44.2 C
*...2Reverse Primer (Riboswitch) Tm= 61.0 C

'''3.) Ligations R-AA:'''
*pSB1(A2/A3/AK3)    Tm = 56.8 C
*C00622 Tm = 43.6 C


''PCR Program'': <br>
'''1.) Ligations A-I: J37015 No2'''
*30 cycles
**94 C for 1min.
**46.9 C for 1min. (Annealing Temperature)
**72 C for 40sec

**Final Ext.: 72 C for 10min. 
**Final Hold: 4 C

'''2.) Ligations J-Q: Riboswitch'''
*same as above but Annealing Temp.: 44.2 C

'''3.) Ligations R-AA: J37019 No2'''
*same as above but Annealing Temp.: 38.6 C


''After PCR:'' 
Run gels to check whether PCR & ligations were successful
*Add 2uL loading buffer to each PCR eppendorf tube
**Note: Some eppendorfs strangely had only little liquid inside after PCR: C,E,H,I,K,Q
*Gel: 90V for 30min.


''Results:''
*PCR gel does not give the same results as miniprep, there seems to be no correlation
*Photos of the gel to be uploaded

*Gel for Ligations 3.) has not been run yet - needs to be run tomorrow.

===Fusion PCR===

ran one of the 2 reactions, ran out of nucleotieds, couldn't do second one.
Tubes frozen
Testing tomorrow
