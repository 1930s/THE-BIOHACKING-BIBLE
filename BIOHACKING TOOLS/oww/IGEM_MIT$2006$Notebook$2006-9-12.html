#plate reader: 7 tubes in 37 room (amp, a/t, a/k backbone controls) '''done: dilutions (SP), loading at 5pm (KB)'''
#*E 1-3 = J450987 a/k 
#*E 4-6 = R0040-E0840 amp
#*E 7-9 = J45270 a/t
#*E 10-12 = osmY-E0840 SN a/t
#*F 1-3 = J45017 amp
#*F 4-6 = osmY-Q-E0840 FN a/k
#*7-9 = osmY-E0840 FN amp
#colony PCR '''lots''' of colonies from the y0078 and y0080 plates: looking for an ATF1 length insert!! '''done: pcr and LCs (SP) 2 gels (KB)'''
#* -- ALL FAILED!!!! boo
#sequence analysis '''done: KB'''
#*320s are definately correct
#*all 399s incorrect
#*397 definately correct for final BB box
#*1148-mutated J45220 definately correct/successful mutagenesis
#'''NOTE:''' unfortunately, i don't think that the 6 sample sequence order of the 398-muts was ever completed today. since it is way past 5, i moved this task to tomorrow's wiki (KB)
