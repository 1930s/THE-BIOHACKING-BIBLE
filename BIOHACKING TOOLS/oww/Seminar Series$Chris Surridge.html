===Talk Overview===
Dr. Surridge is helping start [http://plosone.org PLoS ONE], an effort to democratize scientific contribution, access, review, and merit.  This exciting new journal publishes scientifically sound research regardless of subjective criteria such as "likely impact" or "reader interest".  Following publication, readers  comment, annotate, and rate each paper, adding value to the work as time goes on.  Dr. Surridge will talk of the progress to date, and the challenges that lie ahead.

===Biography===
Adapted from the [http://www.plos.org/about/people/one.html PLoS Biography]

Christopher Surridge graduated with a degree in Biophysics from Leeds University in 1988 and went on to study the dynamics of microtubule assembly at Imperial College London. After a couple of years of post-doc research he moved into scientific publishing as Assistant Editor on Nature Structural Biology in December 1993. In 1995 he moved onto the editorial team at Nature where he handled an eclectic mix of subject areas mainly focusing on biophysics, mathematical and systems biology, and plant science. He also spent some time editing Nature's Brief Communication section which has never fully recovered. By mid-2005 the allure of reshaping scientific publishing to satisfy the needs of a new century became irresistible and he moved to PLoS's Cambridge office working on a new project called PLoS ONE to be launched in 2006.
