__NOTOC__
==Scope==
*Define features of the future Registry of BioBrick Models:
**Supported parts and associated models.
**Supported user actions (edit, browse, search ...)
*Specify interactions with the existing physical DNA Registry.
*Detail choices in term of implementation.

=== Supported user actions ===


== Interactions with the DNA Registry ==

===DNA Registry --> Model Registry===
*Any supported part (see list above) on the parts registry should have a link to the corresponding page on the model registry.  The link will point to a generic 'Special Page' on the Model Registry with a set of information relating to the part described, such as:
**Part type (Constitutive Promoter, Activated Promoter, RBS, Coding Region, Composite ...)
**part ID number
**if it is a composite part, the Registry should provide through the link the sequence of the atomic parts (or maybe the subparts???).
*Models can be only added to the model registry if that category of parts exists in the parts registry.

===Model Registry --> DNA Registry===
*Could query DNA Registry with a given model to get all the existing DNA parts described by such a model.
*A new assembly of models (from existing part models) could be used to register a new assembly (composite part) on the DNA Registry.
*Part models should be used to constrain characterization of parts (maybe an other Registry dedicated to characterization).

== Implementation ==
*The registry of BioBrick models will be implemented as a new Registry (run on a different server than the DNA registry).
**A proof of concept version could be demonstrated on OWW.
*At first, full integration within the MediaWiki framework will be explored (i.e. no need for an additional database as used on the parts registry):
**models will be curated as standard wiki pages.
**possible need to implement Special Pages or Extensions.
*interactions with the DNA Registry might require changes on the DNA Registry side.


==To do list==
'''Building a library of generic models:'''
*List all type of BioBricks available on the DNA Registry. <font color=green> (work in progress)</font>
*Define for each type its interface (inputs/outputs) + associated units. <font color=green> (work in progress)</font>
*Create for each type a generic CellML description + provide detailed derivation/assumptions.<font color=red> (to be done)</font>
*Define metadata needed for each type.<font color=red> (to be done)</font>

'''Communication with the DNA Registry:'''
*Define info needed from DNA registry <font color=green> (work in progress)</font>

'''Using MediaWiki script to support a Registry:'''
*Check how CellML info can be stored and accessed on a wiki page (to create new models and to assemble models). <font color=red> (to be done)</font>
*Investigate the construction of a 'Special Page' to access models from Registry.<font color=red> (to be done)</font>
*Investigate the construction of a 'Special Page' to build new models from existing models-import mechanism in CellML) .<font color=red> (to be done)</font>
