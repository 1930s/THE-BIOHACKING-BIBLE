==Construction of pT7-GFP==
#Innoculated 5ml of LB + Kan with 550Î¼l of fresh overnight culture
#Grew culture in 37&deg;C until O.D.600 = 0.6
#Induced expression of RNA polymerase with 1mM IPTG
#Checked for fluorescence after 4 hours of induction
#Colony 1 showed a fluorescence reading of ~200 000
#*Negative control of non-induced Colony 1 had a reading of ~3 000
#Colony 4 showed a fluorescence reading of ~3 000
#*Negative control of non-induced Colony 4 had a reading of ~3 000
#Colony 1 seems to contain the correct pT7-GFP DNA construct

==Testing of different [AHL] on pTet-LuxR-pLux-GFP DNA construct==
[AHL] of 3nM, 5nM and 7nM was tested. Results can be found here.

Protocol can be found here under [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Experimental_Design/Phase2/Protocol_2.2.1|Prelimineary AHL testing]] on the experimental design page.
