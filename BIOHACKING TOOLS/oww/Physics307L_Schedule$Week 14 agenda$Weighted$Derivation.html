==Step 1: Probability of each measured mean, given parent distributions with same true value==
===(I.e., assume both data sets have the same "true" value, but with differing standard deviations)===
===Assume Guassian distributions===
===Probability is===
(See p. 174 of Taylor)

==Step 2: What is joint probability of getting both means?==
===Simplify with chi-squared short-hand===
:<math>Prob(x_A, x_B) \propto \frac{1}{\sigma_A \sigma_B}e^{-\chi^2 / 2}</math>
:<math>\chi^2 = \left( \frac{x_A-X}{\sigma_A}\right)^2 + \left( \frac{x_B-X}{\sigma_B}\right)^2</math>

==Step 3: Principle of maximum likelihood: minimize chi-squared with respect to X==

==Step 4: Solve for X==
