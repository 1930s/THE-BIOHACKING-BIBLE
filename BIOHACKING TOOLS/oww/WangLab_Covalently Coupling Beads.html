== Protocols for coupling magnetic carboxyl beads to EGF or Fibronectin ==

*From T.M. Jovin, J. cell Science 114, p2437 (2001)
##	activating beads, 0.1M sulfo-NHS 0.1M EDC RT, 1hr in 0.1M MES (ph5)
##	2x wash 0.1M MES
##	equilibrate in coupling buffer 0.1M sodium phosphate, ph 8
##	50 ug EGF (Fn?) or BSA (as control) in 30 l coupling buffer / 6 l of 5% bead slurry. Overnight rocking 4oC, coupling
##	2x wash coupling buffer
##	1M ethanolamine, RT, 2 hr, (quenching)
##	2x thorough wash with PBS
##	store in PBS+0.1% sodium azide

*from Philippe Bastiaens, Science, EGFR activation. 
##	make 1 ml 1% bead suspension in 50 mM MES at ph 6.1
##	prepare stock solutions of EDC (200mM) and NHS (500mM)
##	esterification, add 10 ul of the EDC and NHS stock solutions to the beads (2mM EDC and 4mM NHS). Incubate 15min while rocking 
##	prepare 1ml sodium bicarbonate buffer at ph 8.3, add EGF to a final conc 1ug/ml
##	Quench EDC, add 1,4ul BME to the beads after the incubation
##	wash the beads, quick
##	couple the EGF, put the beads in the EGF solution at ph 8.3
##	incubate at RT for 30 min
##	Quench reaction, add10 ul 1M hydroxylamine
##	thorough wash with PBS
##	store in 50%glycerol at –20oC
