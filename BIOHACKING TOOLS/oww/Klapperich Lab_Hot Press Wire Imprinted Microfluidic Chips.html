==Overview==
Fabricate wire-imprinted microfluidic chips on the hot press. 

==Materials==
*Mechanical Hot Press
*Zeonex beads
*2 removable nickel plates
*4 cm long segments of 0.38 mm wire
*Metal tongs

==Procedure==
#Set the temperature of the mechanical hot press to 350&deg;F.
#Center a circular arrangement of zeonex beads one layer thick onto one of the metal plates.
#Place the metal plate onto the bottom hot press platen.
#Carefully align the second plate on top of the first plate without disturbing the collection of zeonex beads.
#Hot press the zeonex for 5 minutes at 250 psi.
#Remove the metal plates and let them cool enough to be handled.
#Peel the zeonex disk off the metal plates.
#Set the zeonex disk back onto one of the removable metal plates.      
#Take 0.38 mm wire cut to a length of 2 cm and arrange four of the wire pieces parallel to each other, staggering them by about 1 cm on the zeonex disk.     
#Place the metal plate onto the bottom hot press platen.
#Carefully align the second plate on top of the first plate without disturbing the arrangement of wire segments.   
#Reduce the temperature of the hot press to 320&deg;F.   
#Hot press the zeonex for 2 minutes at 500 psi.     
#After removing the metal plates, let the plates cool enough to be handled. 
#Peel the wire imprinted zeonex disk off of the metal plates.
#Pop the wire pieces out of the zeonex disk.
#Drill, from the grooved side, a hole at each end of an imprinted channel so that the hole overlaps the channel slightly.
#Using tweezers, remove any residual plastic from around the drilled hole.
*Bonding     
#Set the temperature of the hot press to 276&deg;F.
#Place an imprinted chip on top of a microfluidic chip base with the grooved side facing the chip base.
#Place the stack onto one of the removable metal plates, and set the metal
plate on the bottom platen.      
#Set the second metal plate on top of the first plate.
#Preheat the chip by pumping the handle until the hot press platens meet, but the pressure registers 0 psi for 1 minute.
#Bond the base and the imprinted chip by hot pressing for 2 minutes at 550 psi.
