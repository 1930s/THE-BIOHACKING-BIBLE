|I am interested in invasiveness as a trait that evolves after an exotic species is introduced to a new environment.  One known mechanism of such evolution is hybridization with native or other introduced species.  Hybridization can be advantageous for a number of reasons: it can create fixed heterosis in a clonally-reproducing species, increase overall genetic diversity in the population, or most intriguingly, generate novel genotypes leading to novel traits or combinations of traits.<br />
''Rubus armeniacus'', or Himalayan blackberry (a native of Eastern Europe), was introduced to California in the late nineteenth century and is now listed as highly invasive by the California Invasive Plant Council.  Prior to the advent of molecular genotyping techniques, natural hybridization of ''R. armeniacus'' with both the native ''R. ursinus'' and the introduced ''R. laciniatus'' was demonstrated with morphological, cytological, and chromatographic data.  In the field I have observed a number of putative ''R. armeniacus'' X ''ursinus'' hybrids.  My aims are 1) to use molecular markers to determine how widespread hybridization of ''R. armeniacus'' with other ''Rubus'' species is in California, and 2) to determine if hybridization is conferring any sort of adaptive advantage.  For example, the invader could have introgressed genetic material from one or more other species, and/or early-generation hybrids could have the potential to become invasive themselves.
