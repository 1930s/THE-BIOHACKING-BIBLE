|| Emperical derivation of a mass transfer coefficient for amomnia in air. The resulting cofficients have been used since 1924 in theoratical models for predicting ammonia emissions.

|| The core model uopn whihc 30 reviewed NH3 emisison models are based, is a convective transfer model: flux in mass/(time.area)= mass transfer coefficient in m/s (concentration gradient). The manure concentration in this model can be measured or derived using Henry's constant, dissociation ocnstant (if ammonium level in material is known), and other factors. [..]
