The Fourth International Meeting on Synthetic Biology (SB4.0) will be held from '''10-12 October 2008''' at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong.<br>
<br>
The organization of the event is being led by the [http://www.biobricks.org/ BioBricks Foundation] in partnership with the [http://www.ust.hk/eng/index.htm Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)], the [http://www.hku.hk/ University of Hong Kong (HKU)], and the [http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/v6/en/ Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)].<br>
<br>
SB4.0 will be a significant meeting, building on the past successes of [[Synthetic_Biology:Synthetic_Biology_1.0 | SB1.0 (MIT)]], [[Synthetic_Biology:Synthetic_Biology_2.0 | 2.0 (UC Berkeley)]], and [http://www.syntheticbiology3.ethz.ch/ 3.0 (ETH Zurich)]. <br>
<br>
'''UPDATE:''' Given all the early progress in synthetic biology, plus how much there is still to do, SB4.0 is going to be an amazing meeting.  The organizers of the meeting can't pretend that we understand everything that should be presented or discussed at the conference.  Thus, we are asking for your help.  If you would like to suggest a topic for discussion, or organize a breakout session, or can suggest whatever would work best for a particular idea, please join the [[The_BioBricks_Foundation:MailingLists | discussion list]] and let us know.
