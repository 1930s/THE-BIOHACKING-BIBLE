Lapatinib is a chemotherapy drug, and an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB-2 (Her2/neu) dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  It works by disrupting chemical signals that stimulate the growth and spread of cancer cells. Specifically, this drug blocks the activity of two tyrosine kinases (proteins involved in cell communication) called EGFR and HER2, which are found in increased amounts on some types of cancer cells, including hepatocellular and biliary tract cancers.

GlaxoSmithKline is developing lapatinib under the brand name Tykerb.
