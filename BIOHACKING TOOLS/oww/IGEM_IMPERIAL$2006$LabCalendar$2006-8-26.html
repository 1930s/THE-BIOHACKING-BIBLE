Grew up fresh day cultures for freezing at 9.30am
*T9002
*J37016
*J37015
*S01656
*J37015RS
*J37020 

Using this [http://openwetware.org/wiki/Endy:Making_a_long_term_stock_of_bacteria protocol], we froze 6 different parts that we are testing

*Made up 10 Eppendorf tubes of S01656 with 15{{uL}}
*Made up 30 Eppendorf tubes of T9002 with 15{{uL}}
*Made up 25 Eppendorf tubes of J37015RS with 15{{uL}}
*Made up 20 Eppendorf tubes of J37015 with 15{{uL}}
*Made up 16 Eppendorf tubes of J37016 with 15{{uL}}
*Made up 20 Eppendorf tubes of J37020 with 15{{uL}}

*Transferred them to the -80{{c}} freezer (in Dr.Mann's section on 6th floor biochem.)

==Testing==

*Set up fresh cultures of T9002 and J37016, we didn't make a J37020 last night
