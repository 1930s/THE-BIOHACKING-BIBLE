1. Working Stocks
   44nM scaffold (20{{uL}})
   0.99{{uM}} of each oligo
2. Protocol
    - goal: 10 nM scaffold w/ 100 nM each oligo, total rxn vol of 20{{uL}}
    - calculations:
       scaffold = (10nM)/(44nM) * 20{{uL}} = 4.5{{uL}}
       oligos = (100nM)/(990nM) * 20{{uL}} = 2{{uL}}
    - reaction mixture:
       4.5{{uL}} p7308 scaffold
       2{{uL}} oligos
       2{{uL}} 10x folding buffer (500mM HEPES ph 7.5, 500mM NaCl, 100mM MgCl2)
       11.5{{uL}} dH2O
    - annealing times:
       90dC, 5'
       65dC, 20'
       55dC, 20'
       45dC, 20'
       37dC, 30'
    - neg. controls: 1 replacing oligos w/ water, 1 replacing scaffold w/ water
