==Plates==
*No growth on I2056.
*F2620-3K3 sample 1 and F2620-1AK3 have a few small colonies. F2620-3K3 sample 2 has 1 colony

==To Do==
*PCR clean digests from yesterday
*Ligate them
*Mini-Prep and digest 3K3 (E/X)

==ccdB==
*PCR products are digested and cleaned up.

==I2055==
*Ran gel of PCR, made o/n of only colony that looked right size.

==T9002==
*Running pcr of F2620-3k3 and 1AK3

==BB PCRs==
*Primers came today, so started E0240 (E-S) and I2057 (E-X) (Tm=52 deg)

==Ligations==
*I2055-1AK3 and 3K3
*I2056-1AK3 and 3K3
*I2057-1AK3
*E0240-1AK3
F2620-1AK3

==I2055 Synthesis==
*Decided not to make the silent point mutation; will use an AatII site on 3K3 (~100bp upstream of the cloning site) instead of MfeI
