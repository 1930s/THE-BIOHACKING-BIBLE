==Sequence verification==
*Notes
**Use AlignX for multiple sequence alignment
**Sequences in Documents -> sequences -> folder named w/date
**View chromatograms in FinchTV
**Registry also has sequence verification software in development.
*I2055 sequence didn't check (R0040 missing)
**This explains why the primers for the PCR didn't work...
*Choosing colonies 3,4, and 6 to sequence, since they looked slightly larger on the 6/19 gel.
**Growing with amp+kan
*Also ordered primer to insert the sequence by PCR:
**format: 8-mer.MfeI.promoter+mix.part of gfp (Tm)
**CTTAGTAG.CAATTG.tccctatcagtgatagagattgacatccctatcagtgatagagatactgagcactactag.ATGCGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTTTTC (52.4)

==I2056 Construction==
*Got one colony on 1AT3
*Re-plating the rest (1AT3, 1AC3)
*Did colony PCR, but reaction seems to have evaporated...diluting w/10uL water and running on gel. re-doing PCR in parallel


==Analytical Gel==
*Loaded in this order: ladder, blank, t9002 scarred, I2056, ladder.
