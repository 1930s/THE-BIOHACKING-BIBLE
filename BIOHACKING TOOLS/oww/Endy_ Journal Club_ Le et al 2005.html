==Jounal Club Date==
TODAY!  In '''574''' at 2 pm.

Voting's done. Friday, October 7th it is. Per suggestion, we will move the time back to accomodate Harvard Systems Bio lunch. I will try to reserve a room for 2 pm. -[[User:Cconboy|cmc]] 10:30, 3 Oct 2005 (EDT)

===Friday, 10-07-05, 2pm, room 68-574===

Harvard Systems Biology lunch is from 12-1 pm.  Should we delay this a bit in case people are returning from there? 
If people can do 1:30 equally well, then yes. [[User:Cconboy|cmc]] 19:43, 27 Sep 2005 (EDT)

Characterizing the dynamics of specific RNA levels requires real-time RNA profiling in a single cell. We show that the combination of a synthetic modular genetic system with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy allows us to directly measure in real time the activity of any specific promoter in prokaryotes. Using a simple inducible gene expression system, we found that induced RNA levels within a single bacterium of Escherichia coli exhibited a pulsating profile in response to a steady input of inducer. The genetic deletion of an efflux pump system, a key determinant of antibiotic resistance, altered the pulsating transcriptional dynamics and caused overexpression of induced RNA. In contrast with population measurements, real-time RNA profiling permits identifying relationships between genotypes and transcriptional dynamics that are accessible only at the level of the single cell.
