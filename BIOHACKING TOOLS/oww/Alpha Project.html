====Introduction====
The static web gateway to the Alpha Project is online [http://www.molsci.org/Dispatch?action-WebdocWidget:4756-detail=1 here].  From this page... the overall goal of the Alpha Project is to gain the ability to predict the quantitative behavior of a eukaryotic regulatory network in individual cells over time and in response to defined perturbations. The project consists of combined experimental and computational work on a well-studied eukaryotic regulatory system, the G-protein receptor-coupled signal transduction pathway that governs the response of haploid MATa ''S. cerevisiae'' to the mating pheromone, a factor. This signal transduction pathway is prototypical of similar regulatory networks that govern responses to extracellular stimuli in higher eukaryotes.

The Alpha Project is currently funded by a grant from the NIH National Human Genome Research Institute.  Alpha Project investigators are based at the Molecular Sciences Institute, Caltech, MIT, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
