===Notes from End of Week July 1===

====Division of Labor====
*Lab Plan: Jenny, Jen
*Antibody: Maxine, Ray, Will
*Pathway: Jessica, Annie


====Action Plan====
*Let's start ordering. 
**Send an e-mail of list of items we need, and then specify of location to obtain them. 
*Design/spec experiments we can do right now.

====Antibodies====
*Concern of antirabbit not being expressed - Don't worry about it.
*Partial cds - did not seq. entirety. (alignment - look for obvious landmarks)
*Not using antimouse.
*We need to get the clone, we need the antibody for testing. <b>Call them today!</b>
**Be careful of evil people.
*Companies that make scFv's (28 wk w/ antigen, 8 wk w/o), very pricey. 
**<b>Small initial investment for large future gain.</b>
*Manufacture DNA with fluorecein as part of sequence. Wittrup lab has done this with scFv on yeast.
*Engr own antigens - add flag to antibody, and antiflag will respond. 
*[http://www.abcam.com/index.html?datasheet=19491 Fluorecein antibody (rabbit)]
====Pathways====
*Typical protein assume = 3 nm.
*ToxR reporter and cI fusion are made. We should order them.


To talk about:

<b>Updates:</b>
*Applications: we're thinking about it. 
*Antibodies
**Secondary
***ScFV antirabbit
::::not expressed in cell
::::delete sequence for sensing gold binding
::::partial cds?
::::contact author
***ScFV antimouse-too specific
***Find backup sequence?
***Call companies that manufacture ScFVs, contact authors of papers w/scfvs
***antidigoxin, antidnp; need to check out more.  list of commerciall available chem that won't hurt cells?
**Primary
***Santra cruz: all bind to specific aa on a human protein: problem??  check w/an advisor
**Antigens
***common epitopes: Myc, FLAG (found in sigma aldrich), HA (could not find)
*Paths we're going down:
*#ToxR system with small molecules only
*#ToxR with linker through periplasm to an OMP
*#*Build our own linker????
*#*Use the MFP (membrane fusion protein) -- use as structural support, etc.
*#*Use TonB
*#Screen FecA linker library
*Still waiting for word from UCSF, Daniel Kuhne
*Found Sequences for these coding regions:
*#ToxR cds
*#ctx promoter
*#alkaline phosphotase (used to test for dimerization)
*#FecA, FecR
*#TonB
*#MalE
<b>Questions:</b>
*Is attempting to use a structural connection between inner and outer membranes proteins insane?
*Maxine's antibody question
