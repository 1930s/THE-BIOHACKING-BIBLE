1. Choose DNA protocol -> enter, enter, enter...
2. Choose Dilution Factor
   Usually 20x for miniprep product, and 100x for maxprep product.
3. Subtract Background
   Blank H2O 200 100 ul (miniprep, 200 ul for maxiprep)
   -> Read blank
4. Continue -> Read Sample -> Measure twice -> Read sample -> ?
   The amount of DNA needed:
   miniprep: 5 ul dilute 20 times -> 100 ul
   maxiprep: 2 ul dilute 100 times -> 200 ul ; 
   and measure again after adding water to adjust concentration.
