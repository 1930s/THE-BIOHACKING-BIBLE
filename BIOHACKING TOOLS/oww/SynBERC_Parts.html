'''This is a draft list of research topics that the SynBERC Parts Thrust is considering for support.'''  <br>
<font color="red">'''Please contribute & edit with impunity.'''</font><br>
We need to get the set of topics correct and then organize ourselves (and anybody else who wants) around getting the work done.
