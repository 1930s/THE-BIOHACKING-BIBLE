==BEInG Mission Statement==

We are individuals from diverse scientific and engineering backgrounds working together to design, disseminate, and deploy realistic scenarios for the generation of [[renewable energy]] from life-based systems.

==Current Project: Build a [[Hydrogen Photobioreactor]] (PBR)==

This is our current project.  The bioreactor has three PVC tubes filled with algae.  When the algae is subjected to an anaerobic environment, an enzyme in the algae, hydrogenase, produces hydrogen gas.  This hydrogen gas can then be used as a fuel source.

Please see the links below for more information.
