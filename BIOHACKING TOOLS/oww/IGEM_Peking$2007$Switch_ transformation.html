==Transformation==

1．	Put the competent cells into ice box as soon as their solution melts.

2．	Add ligation system 10uL or plasmid 0.5uL into solution.

3．	Keep in ice for 30min.

4．	Heat shock in 42℃, JM109 and DH5alpha for 30s, BL21 for 120s, all other for 90s.

5．	Put the competent cells into an ice box immediately for 2min.

6．	Add 800uL LB media in a super clean bench.

7．	Recover 160rpm for 30-45min.

8．	If it is positive plasmid, smear 100uL solution directly onto plate. If it is ligation system, centrifuge for 5000rpm for 4min, discard the supernatant and smear the remainming onto the plate with antibiotic medium.
