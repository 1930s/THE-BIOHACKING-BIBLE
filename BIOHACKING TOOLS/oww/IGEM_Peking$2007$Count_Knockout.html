==General Strategy==
*Use plasmid pKO3 to generate precise deletions in chromosome of Escherichia coli through homologous recombination
*For working principle of pKO3 please refer to Link A. et al., (1997) J Bacteriol, Vol. 179 (20), 6228–6237
*All pKO3 containing strains must be cultivated in the following condition to ensure the survival of plasmid pKO3: LB, Cm+ (25 μg/mL), 30℃ for 24 hours.

==oriT Knock Out==
===oriT-deleted fragment construction===
*oriT-F, -R751 and -pSC101 are fragments in length of several hundred (bp).  To delete these, fragments contain up- and downstream sequences (500 bp each) but not oriT are constructed.
#For each oriT-deleted fragment construction, 2 pairs of primers are designed: each contains a 30-bp overlapping sequence (Fig. 1A).
#oriT-F has BamHI restriction sites at both of its 5’ and 3’ ends.  oriT-R751 and oriT-pSC101 has BamHI at 5’ and SalI at 3’ end.
#Two sets of PCR are needed to produce a final product (Fig. 1B).

===Sequencing fragments===
#PCR fragments are digested by restriction enzymes.  Hold the systems in 30℃ (F) or 37℃ (R751 and pSC101) for 20 hours.
#Ligate the digested fragments with pUC18 vector, then transformed them into DH5a competent cells and cultivate on Amp+ X-gal LB plates.
#Pick up white spots and send them to Boshang Zhanxin company for sequencing.

===pKO3 plasmid construction===
#Pick up sequencing-corrected clones and purify their plasmid pUC18.
#Digest using restriction enzymes and use gel separation and purification to acquire correct oriT-deleted fragments.
#Ligate the correct fragments with plasmid pKO3, then transformed them into DH5a competent cells and spread on Cm+ LB plates.  Hold the plates in 30℃ for 24 hours.
#Pick up colonies for colony PCR verification with two primers: one from pKO3 (i.e. pKO3-R) and another from oriT-deleted fragment (i.e. oriT-F-1S).  Make sure they cover different directions of the plasmid.
#Cultivate PCR-verified clones, purify their plasmid and digest using restriction enzymes for final verification.

===Homologous Recombination===
#Transform plasmid pKO3 with oriT-deleted fragments into competent cells with plasmid F, R751 and pSC101.  Hold them in 30℃ for 24 hours.
#Pick up one colony and shake in liquid Cm+ LB for 12 hours.
#Spread the liquid onto 17μg/mL Cm+ plates, then hold in 43℃ for 12 hours.  Set control in 30℃.
#Pick up one colony and shake in liquid Cm+ LB for 12 hours in 37℃.
#Spread the liquid onto Sucrose plates and hold in 30℃ for 24 hours for positive selection.
#Pick up colonies and draw lines in Cm+ LB plates for negative selection.
#PCR verification to get final products.
