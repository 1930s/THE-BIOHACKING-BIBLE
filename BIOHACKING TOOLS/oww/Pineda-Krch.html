I am a Post Doctoral Fellow at the Center for Animal Disease Modeling and Surveillance at the University of California, Davis. I am interests in a range of topics in theoretical ecology and evolutionary biology. Currently I am particularly interested in population dynamics of finite populations, coevolutionary dynamics of competitive ecological interactions, and adaptive evolution under global environmental change.

Here you'll find a description of my current research, my whereabouts, and my repository of code snippets and software that you are welcome to peruse.

I also hang out on my blog, [http://www.pineda-krch.com Mario's Entangled Bank].
