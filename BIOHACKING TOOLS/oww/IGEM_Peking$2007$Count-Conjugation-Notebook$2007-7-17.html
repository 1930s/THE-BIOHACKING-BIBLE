=Plasmid Construction=
==Miniprep==
*For E0040 and J23066;  Note: pSB3K3 fails to grow in the preculture process. Possible reason: this pSB3K3 contains ccdB and the supposed transformants on the pSB3K3 plate are contaminated.
*Use Trans Kit. 
*Final volume: 50uL for each plasmids.

==Fetch the I7100==
*We use I7100, which is inserted in pSB3K3, to substitute the pSB3K3 carrying the ccdB.

==Digestion Test==
*For pSB1AK3-1, R0040-1 and E0040-2
*EcoR I single digestion.
*Our digestion system contains (totally 20uL): 2uL 10*H, 0.5uL EcoR I, 3uL plasmid, 15uL ddH2O.
*The result cannot be shown now but will be uploaded later. 

==Plans for tomorrow==
*Miniprep of I7100.
*Digestion test of some other plasmids.
*PCR practice.
*Fix the UVP system.

==Chromosome Extraction==
#Centrifuged overnight-shaked bacteria and added 700 uL Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) / EDTA (1mM)
#Added Proteiase K (10 mg/mL) 10 uL, then 10% SDS 38 uL to the final volume of 750 uL.
#Hold overnight in 50 centigrade.
