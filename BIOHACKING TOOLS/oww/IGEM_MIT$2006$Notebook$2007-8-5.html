=Things to Do=

1. Transform MG1655 cells with J45800- DONE

2. Make glycerol of J45120 and J45200 Indole-knockout cells (they smelled strongly in large cultures)

3. Make LCs of all the transformants (all grew up) and add precursor to ones with both mint and banana to observe when they smell (also grow them up in 25 mL media)

4. Make new EZ media - amino acids and + amino acids to grow up J45800 and J45700
