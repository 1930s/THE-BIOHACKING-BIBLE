'''Species description'''
*It is an endemic subalpine race of the more widespread lowland ssp. ''guttatus''.  It was found in rocky runnels and along wet mossy margins of alpine rivulets.  A few isolated collections were made on amrgins of streams that have their headwaters in the maine spine of the Queen Charlotte Ranges.  Such collections are undoubtedly plants produced from seeds, or plants themselves, that have been carried down the streams during periods of high run-off in the spring and summer months.
