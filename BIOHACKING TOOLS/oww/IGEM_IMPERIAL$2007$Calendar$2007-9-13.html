==Meeting with Prof Kitney==

===Team Logo===
*Work on Sherlock Holmes 2007 theme (Silhouette with test tube?)
*Wiki main page design to have easy navigation icons
*Wet lab and dry lab pages to be linked back to CBD, ID and Home pages
*The rest of the wiki to retain professional layout for the scientific community

===Vesicles===
*Presented comparison between in-vitro and in-vivo
*Ties in with the bottom-up approach of synthetic biology
*So far achieved gene expression in vesicles (low yield)
*Try to relate vesicles to the CBD and ID applications
*Characterisation of CFS? (maybe focus on getting data for CBD and ID first)

===Infector Detector===
*DsRed from GeneArt is delayed because of quality control (scheduled to arrive early next week)
*Focus on infections caused by biofilms on urinary catheters (as opposed to other types of catheters)
*Final product detects biofilm by shining UV light on the catheters (try to simulate this in the lab?)
*Feedback to back up  project with more experimental data in future presentations

===Cell By Date===
*Timeline of project depends on when DsRed arrives
**takes ~1 week to get DNA construct, ~1 week for experiments, 1-2 weeks for data analysis and documentation
*Meanwhile continue experiments with GFP
*Changed specifications - 8&deg;C, 2h (no need for 24-h experiments)
*Evaporation problem is minimised because of lower temperature and shorter time period

===Next Meeting=== 
*Next meeting with Prof Kitney and Prof Freemont to be scheduled for next week
*Aim to obtain some data for both CBD and ID by the next meeting
