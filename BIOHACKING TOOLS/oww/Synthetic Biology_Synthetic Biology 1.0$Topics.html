==What is Synthetic Biology?==

Natural biological systems process information, materials, and
energy. Our understanding of these systems is rapidly
advancing. Unfortunately our ability to use biology as a technology to
process information, materials, and energy as we desire is limited by
our understanding. To circumvent these limits, a field of study is
emerging based on intentional engineering of biological systems.This
Synthetic Biology is focused on the intentional design of artificial
biological systems, rather than on the understanding of natural
biology. It builds on our current understanding while simplifying some
of the complex interactions characteristic of natural biology.

Please consider this list as only a guideline for areas pertinent to Synthetic Biology. As this is an emerging field, there are likely many research fields of interest to this community that are not listed here.  Similarly there are many research areas that may fall under these topics but are not pertinent to the goals of Synthetic Biology.
