Experimental studies of intracellular signaling, gene expression and cell survival decisions of epithelial cells upon bacterial infection, with emphasis on quantitative, time dependent data. Research focused on bacterial pathogens that infect the GI track and utilize secretion systems to deliver molecules that interfere with normal signaling and affect cell behavior, such as Helicobacter pylori, Salmonella typhimurium, Campylobacter jejuni and EPEC. Develop a data-driven predictive mathematical model to describe cell behavior in response to bacterial infection.
