==Mode of Action==
Bacteriocidal.  Diffuses through the porinchannels in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria.  Interacts with at least three ribosomal proteins, inhibiting protein synthesis and increasing translation errors.

==Mechanism of Resistance==

Kanamycin is inactivated by bacterial aminophosphotransferases (APHs). The APHs inactivate kanamycin by transferring the &gamma;-phosphate of ATP to the hydroxyl group in the 3' position of the pseudosaccharide.  The ''Kan<sup>R</sup>'' gene codes for kanamycin resistance.  Several versions of this gene exist, with varying crossover resistance to other antibiotics such as [[neomycin]] or [[gentamycin]].

==Working Concentration and Stock Solution==
Working concentration is 50 &mu;g/ml.  Stock solution is 35 mg/ml in water (kanamycin is insoluble in 50% alcohol).
