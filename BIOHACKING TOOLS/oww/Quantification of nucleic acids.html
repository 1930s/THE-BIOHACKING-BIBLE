Nucleic acids are typically quantitated based on their absorbance of ultraviolet light. Each base has a different absorbance maximum, with the average being at 260 nm. Ambion has a good site that gives a variety of parameters for nucleotides and nucleic acids [http://www.ambion.com/techlib/append/na_mw_tables.html].

== Quantification of RNA ==

* [[RNA blot]]ting or Northern blotting
* [[ribonuclease protection assays]] (RPA)
* [[Q-PCR]] or more specifically [[QRT-PCR]]

RNA blotting and RPAs are the gold standards, since no amplification is involved, but require more RNA. Q-PCR is the most sensitive method and can discriminate closely related mRNAs. It is therefore suitable for quickly quantifying low amounts of RNA.

== Quantification of DNA ==

* [[DNA blot]]ting or Southern blotting
* [[Q-PCR]]
