==Materials==

*We use the [http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/productM0202.asp T4 DNA ligase] from [http://www.neb.com/ NEB]
*Deionized, sterile H<sub>2</sub>O
*Purified, linearized vector (in H<sub>2</sub>O)
*Purified, linearized insert (in H<sub>2</sub>O)

==Ligation Mix==

*X &mu;L vector (equivalent to ~50 ng, can use less)
*Y &mu;L insert 1
*Z &mu;L insert 2
*1 &mu;L 10X Ligase Buffer
*(9.5 - X - Y - Z) &mu;L deionized H<sub>2</sub>O
*0.5 &mu;L T4 DNA ligase

*'''[[User:Reshma P. Shetty|Reshma]] 19:12, 13 December 2007 (CST)''': I frequently [[Knight:Restriction Digest|digest 500 ng]] of each part and the destination vector.  Then I use 2 &mu;L vector, 3 &mu;L insert 1 and 3 &mu;L insert 2 where all three linearized fragments have been purified with a Qiagen minelute PCR purification.

==Calculating Insert Amount==

<math> \rm{Insert\ Mass\ in\ ng} = 3\times\left[\frac{\rm{Insert\ Length\ in\ bp}}{\rm{Vector\ Length\ in\ bp}}\right]\times \rm{Vector\ Mass\ in\ ng} </math>

(Equimolar ratios may be preferable.)

==Procedure==

#Add appropriate amount of deionized H<sub>2</sub>O to sterile 0.6 mL tube
#Add 1 &mu;L ligation buffer to the tube.  <br>Vortex buffer before pipetting to ensure that it is well-mixed. <br>Remember that the buffer contains ATP so repeated freeze, thaw cycles can degrade the ATP thereby decreasing the efficiency of ligation.  It is recommended that you aliquot the Ligation Buffer into smaller quantities.
#Add appropriate amount of insert to the tube.
#Add appropriate amount of vector to the tube.
#Add 0.5 &mu;L ligase. <br>Vortex ligase before pipetting to ensure that it is well-mixed.  <br>Also, the ligase, like most enzymes, is in some percentage of glycerol which tends to stick to the sides of your tip.  To ensure you add only 0.5 &mu;L, just touch your tip to the surface of the liquid when pipetting.
#Incubate 20 mins on the benchtop.
#Place on ice until transformation.
#Generally 1 &mu;L of ligation mix is sufficient for either chemical transformation or electroporation.  The amount of salt in 1 &mu;L ligation mix should not cause arcing.
#''Optional''  Heat-inactivate by incubating at 65&deg;C for 20 mins.  Then do a [[Purification of DNA | purification]] step to remove PEG. (See notes on [[DNA Ligation|DNA ligation]].
