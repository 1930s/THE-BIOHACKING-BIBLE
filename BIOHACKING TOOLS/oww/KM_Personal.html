===Random Stuff===
*I love snow. I get that excited little kid feeling every time it starts snowing. Skiing is also one of my favorite hobbies, such that I am always wishing for more snow (although I couldn't seem to wait long enough for it last season...). Check out this cool [http://www.snowcrystals.com/ site] about snow crystals. It's really amazing how beautiful snowflakes are.

*Here is an excellent tutorial on how [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2657697036715872139 translation] works, with an introduction by the 1971 version of nobel laureate [http://nobelprize.org/chemistry/laureates/1980/berg-cv.html Paul Berg]. I'd like to see it in classrooms everywhere. '''tRNA! peptide bond!'''

===Declarations===
*I have the messiest bench (and desk) in the lab. Paradoxically, I am a tyrant about cleanliness in common lab areas.
