==Overview==
How to use gel electrophoresis to separate, measure and visualize DNA pieces.

==Materials==

*[[Agarose_gel_loading_dye|6X loading dye]]
*[[TAE]] + agarose 1%
*1X [[TAE]] (~200ml)
*gel box (casting tray optional) and power supply
*[[Ethidium Bromide]] staining solution
*used TAE destaining solution
*UV box/gel imager

==Procedure==

===Electrophoresis===

#Microwave TAE agarose 1% to melt.  Pour 30 ml for a small gel into a small flask/beaker to cool a bit, then pour into the gel box with the correct comb for your size/number of samples.
#Add 6x loading dye to your samples.  
#Make sure the red electrode is at the opposite end from the wells. You can check the progress of the DNA with the loading dyes to check the direc
#Set the time and settings on the power supply by pressing Mode to change fields. (typical settings for 100s bp fragments of DNA: 90V constant voltage, 45 minutes)
#Slide on the lid and start the power supply.

===Staining and visualization===

*'''Wear blue/purple nitrile gloves when handling the items at the staining station and the gel imager.'''
#Place the gel in the plastic box.
#Stain for 1 hour in EtBr solution (concentration??).
#Pour the EtBr back into the light-proof bottle.
#Destain with used TAE for 2 minutes.
#Pour the TAE back into the bottle.
#Image the gel on a UV light box or the computerized gel imager in the Polz lab.
#Print out the image for your notebook, annotating the lanes, marker, and bands.
#Note agreement with/variation from expected result.
