==Procedure==
===Gel preparation===
* Carefully tape both ends of the tray with autoclave tape
* Insert the 8-well comb
* Start with 50 mL 1X [[Griffitts:Common_buffers#50X_TAE_.281_L.29|TAE buffer]]
** Use the flask labeled "Agarose&mdash;keep in gel area"
* Add 0.5 g agarose
** Use the agarose labeled "for low-melt DNA gels"
* Microwave until dissolved
** This will take less than 1 minute and will require frequent stirring to prevent a boil-over
* Add 8 μL of 1 mg/mL [[Griffitts:Common_buffers#ethidium_bromide_.2810_mL.29|ethidium bromide]] and stir
** This is kept in the fridge
* Allow to cool ~5 minutes
* Pour into the tray
* Place in a level place in the refrigerator and allow agarose to solidify for at least 30 minutes
* Remove tape and comb
** Remove the comb slowly so you don't tear the wells

===Sample preparation===
* Add 1/5 volume [[Griffitts:Common_buffers#8X_DNA_loading|8X loading dye]] to each of your samples
===Electrophoresis===
* Check to make sure there is enough 1X [[Griffitts:Common_buffers#50X_TAE_.281_L.29|TAE buffer]] in the gel box
** Dr. Griffitts has drawn a black line on the side indicating where is sufficient
** If you suspect the 1X [[Griffitts:Common_buffers#50X_TAE_.281_L.29|TAE buffer]] is old, replace it; you may dump the old 1X [[Griffitts:Common_buffers#50X_TAE_.281_L.29|TAE buffer]] down the drain with water
* Place your gel (still on the tray) in the box with the wells away from you
** If your gel is pointing the wrong way, you will run your samples into the buffer
* Add each of your samples to the wells
** Use the entire sample
** If possible, don't use adjacent wells in case of spill-over
** Avoid using torn wells
* Place the lid on the gel box
** Make sure the black cable is away from you and the red cable is near you
** If you reverse the cables you will run your samples into the buffer
* Turn on the gel box
* Adjust voltage to ~100 V
* Wait until you can see that the [[Griffitts:Common_buffers#8X_DNA_loading|8X loading dye]] has moved 1-2 inches down the gel
** If you can't see your loading dye, you've probably run your samples into the buffer

===Gel slices===
* Remove your gel from the box and take it to 758 WIDB
* Shine the UV lamp on your gel to determine where the bands are
* Cut out the bands using a razor blade
** Carefully wipe the razor blade with a paper towel between each band
** Cut out a DNA-free slice of the gel for your vector-only control
* Place slices in labeled microcentrifuge tubes<br>
Note: These can be stored in the -20°C freezer
===Ligation===
* Put your slices (in microcentrifuge tubes) in the 65°C heating block for 3-5 minutes
* Prepare a Master Mix:
** Remember to prepare an extra tube for each vector-only control
** 6.5 μL sterile ddH<sub>2</sub>0 per sample
** 1.5 μL 10X T4 ligase buffer per sample
*** Be sure to stir up the white chunks
** 1.0 μL T4 ligase per sample
* Bring the block to your bench
* Add 3.0 μL of vector to all tubes
* Add 3.0 μL of insert to the ligation tubes
* Add 3.0 μL of the DNA-free gel slice to the vector-only control tubes
* Add 9.0 μL Master Mix to all tubes
* Incubate at room temperature for at least 1 hour
Note: At this point the samples may be stored in the -20°C freezer
