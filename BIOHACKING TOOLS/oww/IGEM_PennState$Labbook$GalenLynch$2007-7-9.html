<h1>'''July 9th, 2007''': 9:30-6:15</h1>
Results from over the weekend: Initial pfx pcr failed, second attempt was a success. Restrtiction, extraction, purification, ligation, and transformation was performed on the successful bands. Restriction results were verified by gel, with discernable bands. Despite this, transformations were unsuccessful.
<h2>Transformations</h2>
Today's plans: Repeat ligations and transformations.
*New vial of T4 ligase purchased
*Ligations: all in PSB1A2 (from death gene BBa_P1010)
