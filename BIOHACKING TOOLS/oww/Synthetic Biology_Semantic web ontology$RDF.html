==Overview==
Resource Definition Framework - used for making statements about facts
 '''<http://www.example.org/index.html>'''  has a '''creator''' whose value is '''John Smith'''
the RDF terms for the various parts of the statement are:
*the ''subject'' is the URL <http://www.example.org/index.html>
*the ''predicate'' is the word "creator"
*the ''object'' is the phrase "John Smith"

Beware of thinking of RDF as a format for serailizing objects. The semantic web is different - it is weblike.
* Any document can (potentially) say anything about anything. There is no set of "slots" or "attributes" for a class. The properties defined in a schema are not the only properties which one can use to describe something which is in that class.
*An object can be in many classes. When you create a semantic web document about something, others can deduce more things about it, in vocabularies you have never heard of.
*Entity-Relationship and UML diagrams are useful for describing RDF -- so long as you remember the above.

==N3==
Notes:
*Comments start with # sign
*When you say what type of thing something is, you say a Class it belongs to.
*A property is something which is used to declare a relationship between two things.
*When the subject of any property must be in a class, that class is a domain of the property.
*When the object must be in a class, that class is called the range of a property. 
*class identifiers start with capitals, properties with lower case letters
*a rdf:type

*[http://www.dajobe.org/2004/01/turtle/ Turtle - Terse RDF Triple Language] - defines a text syntax for RDF called Turtle as an extension of the N-Triples test case format carefully taking the most useful and appropriate things added from Notation 3 while keeping the syntax describing only RDF graphs.
