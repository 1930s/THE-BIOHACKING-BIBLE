 <u>'''TO DO:'''</u>
 *Electroporate Dr. Fray's plasmid containing aiiA into DH5a 
  If any colonies grow until evening - culture up for testing on Friday !!
 *Maxi & mini of J37022, aiiA (with flag tag), aiiA
 *Next ligation step for new predator cell (with the new aiiA) once maxiprep is finished & electroporation on same day ! 
 *Testing of J37015, J37022, Acylace Activity (need J37016 for two of them)
 *Send J37022 for sequencing
 *Make frozen stock of new T9002, J37036, J37022 !!!
 *Control digest for J37036 - Has ligation worked?

<font color=blue>*JS: Also, you guys need to start sending in parts to the registry, or else we won't have anything to show for all our efforts this summer!  </font>

<font color=periwinkle>*JW: Sorted out the fridge today - we have all the maxis, ready to be sent when necessary, however we have multiple copies of some. We need to determine which is the one that was used in construction.  </font>

==aiiA==

*The new aiiA was sent to us in DH5-α. However the two promoters in the pGEM cloning vector in which it was sent (T7 and Sp6) do not work in DH5-α cells, and so attempting to test for expression here would be pointless
*We can however test for expression in Rosetta, which can use the T7 promoter.

==Miniprep & Maxiprep==
*Are the results successful?
*Maxiprep:
**All four J37022 cultures successfully maxipreped
**One of the two Aiia cultures successfully maxipreped. DNA used for ligations

==Ligation & electroporation==
* New J37023 (Flagged and tagged Aiia from Dr Fray) insert ligated into previously maxipreped stock of 1I (B0015).
*Part J37024
*Electroporated at 5.15pm.

==Electroporation of Dr. Fray's plasmid containing aiiA==
*Was electroporated this morning into Rosetta (not into DH5a because no expression will take place in DH5a due to the promoter not working in this strain)
*Might get some colonies so that it can be cultured for Western Blot tomorrow

==Testing J37015==
*Testing was carried out partly according to the current [http://openwetware.org/wiki/IGEM:IMPERIAL/2006/Protocols/J37015 J37015 protocol] and partly with some added measurements and amended steps. These are outlined below. (The protocol will be adjusted accordingly)
*Put into 2hrs shake at 9:45
*Taken out of shaker at 12:00
*Measure OD: 1.099 and dilute into 25mL to OD 0.1
*Spin down the cells & discard supernatant
*Add 25mL of prewarmed LB & resuspend
*Made up 2 x 25mL cultures
**One is inoculated with 1nM AHL (add 5{{ul}} of 5uM stock to the 25 mL)
**The other one is not inoculated with AHL
''In Dr. Mann's Lab'':
*Place in shaker
*Two samples were taken every 10-15min. for 2hrs 
**One sample: Used Wallac-Victor III after taking samples to read fluorescence and OD (in order to detect GFP levels)
**Second sample: Supernatant is stored in order to assess AHL levels with J37016 later
''Assessing AHL of samples with J37016'':
*Replaced supernatant of J37016 with saved supernatant from above
*Put into shaker for 4hrs shake at 16:00
*Taken out of shaker at 19:30
*Fluorescence reading to assess amounts of AHL present (using J37016) afterwards

==Acylase Check==
This was done to check whether acylase degrades anything that is vital to DH5a  
*Put 2 x 2mL J37016 (OD 0.1) in shaker at 16:20
**One of them is inoculated with 8{{ul}} of Soln 1 of the acylase
**No enzyme was added to the other culture (control)
*OD will be checked & compared after a few hours in shaker

==Control digest of J37036==

*Identified enzymes - will be run first thing tomorrow morning

==LoxP PCR==

*Smaller fragment worked.....at last and so we will give the PCR fusion a go tomorrow
