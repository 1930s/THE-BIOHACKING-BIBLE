'''Our fields of interest are:'''


'''Proteinases & their inhibitors''' (Brigita Lenarčič, Metka Renko, Miha Pavšič)

This is a long-lasting cooperation with the [http://www.ijs.si/ijsw/JSI J. Stefan Institute] (JSI) in Ljubljana, [http://bio.ijs.si/ Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology]  where Professor Vito Turk is heading a programme on Proteolysis and its regulation. 

Brigita is dealing with a group of inhibitors called Thyropins. Together with her postgraduate students at the JSI she managed to obtain recombinant thyropins and determine several interesting biochemical properties of these proteins. Metka is mainly involved in aminopeptidases and their LMW inhibitors. Marko used to work within this programme as well, mainly on cysteine proteinases cathepsins L, H and S.


'''Snake toxin phospholipases''': structure, function and interactions (Petra Prijatelj) and 
'''Molecular evolution''' (Vera Župunski, Nika Lovšin)

Work on these two topics is another cooperation with J. Stefan Institute programme on [http://bio.ijs.si/tox Toxins and biomembranes] (head: Professor Igor Krizaj)


'''Design and production of bifunctional recombinant proteins''' (Jernej Palčič, Marko Dolinar)

Often, fusion proteins composed of two independently folded units are required. It is obvious that for the folding to proceed without disturbances caused by the proximity of the other unit, a spacer is required to separate the units. We wish to determine rules for the length and composition of the linkers connecting the two fusion partners.


'''Humanization of monoclonal antibodies''' (Nives Škrlj, Marko Dolinar)

A cooperation with the Blood Transfusion Centre of Slovenia (BTCS), group of Professor Vladka Čurin Šerbec, started in 2007. BTCS has developed a series of murine monoclonal antibodies against human prion protein that have interesting binding properties and we believe they could be used as therapeutic antibodies.
