The Measurement Kit consists of Promoter Testers, RBS Testers, and an Inverter/Terminator Tester. All Devices are on the [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:pSB3K3 3K3] plasmid.  Also, they are being built in both GFP and RFP versions.  (GFP versions shown below)


==Promoter Tester==

[[Image:E0240.1.jpg|thumb|left|E0240 Version 1 Design]]
The Promoter Tester using GFP is based on <BBpart> E0240</BBpart> and using RFP is based on <BBpart> I2057</BBpart>. Both come in two versions.
*Version 1 (E/S)
**___E X CCDB S___RBS GFP T
**Cut promoter E/S and insert
**Can take part back out if necessary

*Version 2
**___E CCDB X___E0240
**Cut Promoter E/S to insert
**Forms mixed site so can't remove, real conditions

*GFP Promoter Tester Version 1 E/S <BBpart> I20244</BBpart>
*GFP Promoter Tester Version 2 E/X <BBpart> I20245</BBpart>
*RFP Promoter Tester Version 1 E/S <BBpart> I20246</BBpart>
*RFP Promoter Tester Version 2 E/X <BBpart> I20247</BBpart>

==RBS Tester==
[[Image:I2055.1.jpg|thumb|left|I2055  Design]]
The RBS Tester using GFP is based on <BBpart> I2055</BBpart> and using RFP is based on <BBpart> I2056</BBpart>. Both come in two versions.
*Versions 1 (E/X)
**__R0040___E CCDB X____GFP T
**To insert RBS cut E/S, forms a mixed Spe/Xba site
**Has too big spacing (full BB prefix) b/t promoter and RBS 
**Easier for testers to use

*Version 2 (S/X)
**__R0040___S CCDB X____GFP T
**Will get 2 spe/xba mixed sites, can't get RBS out
**Cut RBS X/S, ligate w/ Spe1 and Xba1 restriction enzymes to ensure proper orientation
**Real condition spacing

*GFP RBS Tester Version 1 E/X <BBpart> I20248</BBpart>
*GFP RBS Tester Version 2 S/X <BBpart> I20249</BBpart>
*RFP RBS Tester Version 1 E/X <BBpart> I20250</BBpart>
*RFP RBS Tester Version 2 S/X <BBpart> I20251</BBpart>

==Inverter/Terminator Tester==
[[Image:T9002.1.jpg|thumb|left|T9002 Design]]
*Based on <BBpart> T9002</BBpart>

*F2620________E X P1010 S P________E0040
*Contains a full BB site to allow construction within the device
