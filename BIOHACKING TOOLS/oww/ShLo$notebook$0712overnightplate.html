<b>Conclusions:</b>
*Image 1 shows that the JT construct (quorum-activity expected) grows sharper and reaches a higher overall fluorescence versus the JT induced (with 10nM or 100nM from beginning of experiment). 
*Image 2 shows that the shape of the constitutive GFP (I13522) is different from the JT construct (quorum-activity expected) ... and not necessarily in the good way.
*Image 3 suggests that the number of cells between wells differs drastically. As expected, the non-induced I13263 had lower fluorescence versus the induced samples, but 10nM induction yielded greater fluorescence over time versus 100nM induction, despite initial ODs that were about the same in all samples.
