==digesting R0040 and J23078(crRNA) for ligation==
*digesting R0040 with Spe1/Pst1
*digesting J23078 with Pst1/Xba1 
*Digestion system contains:
#R0040:2uL 10*H, 0.5uL SpeI, 0.5uL PstI, 10uL plasmid, 7uL ddH2O.
#J23078:2uL 10*M, 0.5uL XbaI, 0.5uL PstI, 10uL plasmid, 7uL ddH2O.
*37℃ culutre for 15 hours

=OriT Knock Out=
*By Xu Anting
==PCR for oriT-Deleted Fragments==
*Use chromosome extraction product as template to do PCR, with Taq or Pfu added.
#Result: In Taq PCR all 6 pairs of primers show bright bands at 500 bp, while none is shown in Pfu PCR.
#Conclusion: finally I got oriT up- and downstream fragments of 500 bp with potential site mutations caused by Taq's relatively low fidelity.  I intend to use these products as template to do further PCR and get oriT-deleted fragments of 1200 bp.
