*Two parts were created to fulfil the specifications for the predator sensing test construct


::*a monocystronic <bbpart>J37020</bbpart>
[[image:Monocistronic.JPG ]]



::*a polycystronic <bbpart>J37016</bbpart>
[[image:polycistronic.JPG]]



*These two parts are very similar and have the same inputs and outputs, therefore they can be analysed in exactly the same way



The differences are in the rates of production of GFP to LuxR:
*Part J37016 will produce a polycistronic strand of mRNA and the rate of GFP to LuxR translation will depend on which RBS is farthest upstream. 
*Part J37020 produces two strands of mRNA they are produced by the same promoter, LuxpR but the seuqance surrounding luxpR differs between the two sites so there may be differing rates of transcription between the promoters controlling GFP and luxR. 

==Design choices==

*We need to fulfill all the properties listed in the '''specifications'''.
*Based on the '''Quorum-sensing/quenching''' due to biochemical properties needed and BioBricks availability.

! INPUTS !! biological component !! comments
|-
| Prey molecule || AHL  ||  Acyl Homoserine lactone (AHL) is synthesized by the LuxI gene <bbpart>BBa_C0061</bbpart>
|- style="background:orange"
! OUTPUTS !! biological component !! comments
|-
| Green Flourescent Protein || GFP || GFP is synthesed by the <bbpart>BBa_E0040</bbpart> gene. This gene is in place of AiiA in the predator construct. We make the assumption that rate of production of GFP is equal to the rate of production of AHL-lactonase to generate a transfer curve to allow characterization of the predator sensing part.

! FUNCTIONS !! biological component !! comments
|-
| Prey Sensing|| pLux promoter  <bbpart>BBa_R0062</bbpart>  || The pLux promoter allows us to get the growth of the predator to be function of the population of prey-molecules and predator-molecules.
