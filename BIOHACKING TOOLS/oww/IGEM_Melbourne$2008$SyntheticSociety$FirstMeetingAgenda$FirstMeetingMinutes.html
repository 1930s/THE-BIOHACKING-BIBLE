[[/FirstMeetingMinutes|'''Link to First Meeting Minutes''']]

Meeting Location: Bio21 Level 1 Conference Room

Meeting Time: after the iGEM team meeting

Meeting Logistics: snacks and water 

Current Meeting Length : ~2 hours

Present: Alisa, Craig, Jan, Di, Louis, Millie, Haozhen, Shiny, Yogesh, Lloyd


'''Pre-meeting Tasks'''
*mail was sent out ... hopefully enough ppl will turn up
*organise projector - get this of Prof. Howlett berfore 5pm , need to put back into student area after use (get keys of Alisa)


'''Intro to Synthetic Society'''
*this is effectively what we make it ... 
*(10min)why have a synthetic society???
*(5min)what should its purpose be ... 
*(10min)possible futures - recruitment tool for iGEM team applicants 
*(10min)how big should it get?
*(5min)have a stand at O-Week/ membership drive ... 
*(5min)actual student society
*(0min)should we affilliate with other student societies
*OR just private discussion forum for people interested in synthetic biology 
*(5min)weekly/monthly meetings ??? 


'''Brainstorming/Research'''
*(20 min)go through [http://syntheticbiology.org/Applications.html synthetic biology applications] 
*(30min) watch ljubljana presentation (http://parts.mit.edu/igem07/index.php/Ljubljana) - (need link to video - ask louis???)
*go through ethz project
*go through heinemann paper - "Synthetic biology—putting engineering into biology"
*free discussion
**ghost in the shell/matrix downloading
**ethical implications of synbio?
**opensource - how can we make money from synbio or should we? 
**crazy ideas - chair-organisms / brushoteethia coli etc

systems will
require a systematic approach that relies on modularity and abstraction
at various cellular levels in order to be useful to a broad
group of biotechnologists.



chassis - go through chassis, (problems of isolating chassis, yeast/ecoli, how do you hijack metabolism
berkeley LBL team)

minimal genome host - george church
isolate chassis - jason kelly
question: which approach is better, discuss???
what would be the ideal host, characteristics ... 



engineering proteins (our blue light, wisconsin team w/ DBD of leucine zippers)
our blue light, the gvp's
good place for novel parts ... 


intercellular communcation ... 
AHL 
japanese team 

engineering artificial gene networks 
start - switches (on-off eg below), complex networks (repressilator)
PID control ... (show equations)
complex networks - repressilator

cambridge - amplifier 
ustc - logic gates, go through model
edinborough ... http://parts2.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/EdinburghModeling
ethz - learning, go through model
distinction between deterministic and stochastic modelling ... 
biological noise, van Oudenaarden
compare with michigan/missouri team.. 
peking - hop-count, push-on/push-off


Possible futures : 
In contrast, systems design consisting of forward-engineering of
biological parts, devices or systems strongly relies on computing
and informatics tools that assist the design process. Ultimately, it
would be desirable to have computer aided design tools—CAD
tools for biological engineering—in analogy to the respective software
tools in the areas of mechanical or civil engineering. Using
such software, the synthetic biology design engineer would try to
improve the behavior of a biological system in silico by optimizing
design parameters targeting a selected objective function. Design
variants would be tested computationally by means of simulations.


other ideas
-ferromagnetic bacteria
-temperature sensitive
-different expression system (T7 polymerase etc)
-synbio applications ... 

free dicsussion... 


wouldn't it be cool if we could ...
construct a variable resistor !!!!
pops capacitor, diode have been made 
don't resist electric current but resist pops ... 
don't use ohms but call them endys
use the same bands

*set agenda - what should we do in the mean time
*set next meeting time
