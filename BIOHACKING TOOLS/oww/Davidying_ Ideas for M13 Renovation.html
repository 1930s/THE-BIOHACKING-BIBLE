===M13 Redesign Ideas===
{| Border="2"
! Gene !! Function !! Re-engineering ideas
|-
| g1 || assembly || Increase size but maintain shape and interactions, to attempt to create a larger "barrel" to make a wider filament of M13
|-
| g2 || replication of DNA + strand ||  Separate g2 and g10 by inserting entire sequence of g10 after transcription end of g2/g10 (essentially repeating g10 twice in succession), so that the two genes are independent
|-
| g3 || phage tail protein || Change amino acid sequence to make p3 bind to other proteins besides TolA (perhaps allowing it to infect more bacteria)
|-
| g4 || assembly || (see g1)
|-
| g5 || binds ssDNA || Add GFP or other type of tag to enable rapid measurement of DNA replication (an assay of g2/g10)
|-
| g6 || phage tail protein || Change sequence to allow for easier modification of p3
|-
| g7 || phage head protein || Change sequence to allow for easier modification of p9
|-
| g8 || phage coat protein || Change amino acid sequence to allow g8 (and thus the entire virus) to bind to certain materials, like metals
|-
| g9 || phage head protein || Add or change residues to enable p9 to bind to p3, creating long chains of connected filaments like a nanowire
|-
| g10 || DNA replication || (see g2)
|-
| g11 || assembly || (see g1)
