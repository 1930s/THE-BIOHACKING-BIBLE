25. Valencia

Combination of Sensor & Actuator

Detection of some stimulus: concentration of some chemical/light intensity - Sensor
Grading its "intensity" - pH output based upon colour grading -  Actuator 

(Similar to the "smoke detector" idea)<br>

26. ETH Zurich

Implementation from the engineer's point of view
<br>
Half Adder 
*Building logic circuitry : an AND and an XOR Gate 
<br> 
AND Gate: presence of chemical induces the production of an inactive protein, which is activated by a second protein (produced when light is present): the first protein is then activating GFP production 
<br>
XOR Gate:  
a light sensible promoter  
a chemical sensible promoter  
we would need to give a kind of first signal to the system (to don't have light reactions before a certain moment, otherwise we have to work in a dark room...), an activation signal after the bacterias have grown on the plate 

<br> "their" Pro's & Con's
<br><br>
''Pro's'': 

meaningful from an engineering point of view <br> 
valuable parts addition to synthetic biology <br>
stepwise proceeding applicable (→ intermediate and partial results!) <br> 
experiments visually attractive <br>
probably simple enough <br>

''Con's'': 

cheap copy of “bio-film” project (iGEM 2004) <br>
sensational experiments, have little in common with half adder <br>
maybe that a big vision is lacking <br>
general/practical benefit? (counter-argument: is this required?) <br>
too simple? <br>
