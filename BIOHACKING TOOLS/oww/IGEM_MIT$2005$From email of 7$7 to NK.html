"the cI-ToxR fusions behaved as a dimer in E. coli and as a higher
order oligomer in V. cholerae.  In both organisms, dimerization was
independent of any environmental modulators that were tested (i.e.
dimerization was essentially constitutive).  Additionally, dimerization
appeared to be mediated by more than one domain of the ToxR protein.  And,
as suggested, it apparently does a pretty good job of simply existing as a
dimer on it's own as best we can tell.  The hypothesis that environmental
signals modulate the monomer-dimer transition was _not_ proven by our
studies.

To complicate the issue, there was a publication in 1998 from Japelli and
Brenner that looked at how the length of "linker" domains and expression
levels affected fusion protein activity.  Furthermore, I know from my
studies that expression levels are important for dimerization read-out via
cI.  There is a window within which the reporter system works, and then if
over expressed, the system appears to fail, possibly because of the
complication of ToxR as a membrane protein.  My memory is a little fuzzy on
the details but I think the basic info is accurate.

A number of groups have been interested in using ToxR as a reporter system
for dimerization and have decided not pursued this avenue.  It has turned
out to be rather complicated and additional proteins (TcpPH) have now been
postulated to interact with ToxRS.  This is a whole 'nother can of worms.

The strains and plasmids Jennifer requested are not under my jurisdiction to
distribute.  The AH strains were a generous gift of the Hochshield lab (as
you will recognize!!), and the pHK plasmids belong to a group in Germany
that we briefly collaborated with in an effort to try to sort things out
(Kolmar et al 1995 EMBO preceded our joint paper).John is still the
arbiter of my constructs."
