==Project Overview==
*Our goal is to design and implement molecular containers, which can be dynamically opened and closed by an external stimulus.
*The containers will be implemented as DNA nanostructures, which afford a significant degree of positional control and chemical versatility.
*As an initial proof-of-concept, we plan to use our DNA containers to demonstrate controllable activation ("delivery") of anti-thrombin aptamers.
*We expect that molecular containers could have several interesting scientific and clinical applications, such as 
**Drug and gene delivery
**Bio-marker scavenging (early detection of biomarkers)
**Directed evolution (compartmentalized selections)
**Using multiplexing for combinatorial chemical synthesis
**Capture and stabilization of multiprotein complexes
**Protein folding (chaperones)
**Cell sorting
