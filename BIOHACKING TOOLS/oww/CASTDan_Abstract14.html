Abstract

<br>In this work we present ratiometric measurements of oxygen concentrations using a dual-emitting dye. Three different methods for ratio
measurements in oxygen sensing are employed. The standard wavelength-ratiometric approach is simple to implement, but the sensor
response has significant non-linearity. The frequency discrimination of the lifetimes allows for measurements of dual-emission ratio through a
single emission filter. In this case the Stern–Volmer plots are linear. Another option is to use emission polarization. 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
