==Miniprep of AiiA (J37023) & J37020==
*Miniprep of all AiiA parts (J37023) seems to have worked successfully.  
*Miniprep of J37020 only shows one band around 3000 bp, which does not correspond to anything we should have.  However, the other lane didn't have anything in it, when we were expecting something, so it is better that we do this miniprep again or do the miniprep after maxiprep tomorrow.

==Maxiprep of AiiA (J37023) & J37020==
*Maxiprep successful for AiiA
*J37020 maxiprep unsuccessful, try again tomorrow.

==Sequencing==

*J37016 has been sequenced successfully - [http://openwetware.org/images/4/4d/J37016_sequencing.doc Comparison of observed and expected sequences for J37016]
*J37019 has also been successfully sequenced - [http://openwetware.org/images/e/e3/J37019_sequencing.doc Comparison of observed and expected sequences for J37019]

==Ligation==
*J37018 = J37019 + R0062 (12D)
*J37024 = J37023 (AiiA) + B0015 (1I)

*Gene Clean & Electroporation tomorrow.
