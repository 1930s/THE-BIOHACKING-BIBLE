==Stock solutions==

===1M Tris-HCl pH7.6===
Have a premade stock.

===1M magnesium chloride===
To make 100mL
*Dissolve 20.33 g MgCl<sub>2</sub>6H<sub>2</sub>O in 80mL H<sub>2</sub>O.  
*Adjust volume to 100 mL with H<sub>2</sub>O.  
*Dispense into aliquots and sterilize by autoclaving.  

MgCl<sub>2</sub> is very hygroscopic.  May want to order a fresh bottle since bottles should not be stored for a long time.

===4M potassium chloride===
To make 100mL
*Dissolve 29.82 g solid KCl in 60 mL H<sub>2</sub>O.
*Adjust volume to 100 mL with H<sub>2</sub>O.
*Autoclave for 20 minutes on liquid cycle and store at room temperature.  
*Aliquot into 100 &mu;L aliquots in sterile tubes and use one at a time.

Note that this concentration of potassium chloride solution is near the solubility limits for potassium chloride in water.  So you may need to heat slightly to help the salt go into solution.

==Binding reaction conditions==
*Zinc Buffer A
**10 mM Tris pH7.5
**90 mM KCl
**100 &mu;M ZnCl<sub>2</sub> (or 90 &mu;M ZnCl<sub>2</sub>)
**1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>
*1% BSA
*5 mM DTT
*0.12 &mu;g/&mu;L sheared herring sperm DNA
*10% glycerol
*1 pM target oligonucleotide
