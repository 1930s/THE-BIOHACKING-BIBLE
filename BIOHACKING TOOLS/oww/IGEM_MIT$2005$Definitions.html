<b>cytokine</b> an intercellular chemical messenger protein (eg, tumor necrosis factor, interleukin) released by white blood cells. Cytokines facilitate communication among immune system cells and between immune system cells and the rest of the body.

<b>EGF receptor</b> epidermal growth factor recpetor, (a dimerizing cell surface receptor, but epidermal doesn't sound very yeastial) [http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/Area_of_Interest/Life_Science/Cell_Signaling/Scientific_Resources/Pathway_Slides___Charts/EGF_Receptor_Signal_Transduction_Pathway.html egf]

<b>hapten</b> a part of an antigen.

<b>hematopoietic</b> an agent or process that affects or promotes the formation of blood cells.

<b>phosphorylate</b> To add a phosphate group to (an organic molecule). Primary mode of activation/deactivation in many systems. Phosphorylation of a protein causes a conformation change which results in it assuming its active or deactive state.

<b>kinase</b> Any of various enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a phosphate group from a donor, such as ADP or ATP, to an acceptor.

<b>phosphatase</b> A phosphatase is an enzyme that hydrolyses phosphoric acid monoesters into a phosphate ion and a molecule with a free hydroxy group. This action is directly opposite to that of phosphorylases and kinases, which attach phosphate groups to their substrates at the expense of energy like ATP. A common phosphorylase in the body is alkaline phosphatase.
