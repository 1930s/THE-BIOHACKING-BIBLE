What is iGEM?
The International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) Competition is 
an annual undergraduate research competition hosted by MIT.  The project 
aim is to develop Synthetic Biology through the creation of a growing 
registry of parts. Each part in the registry is an analyzed strain of 
DNA with several specific restriction sites at each end of the fragment. 
These strains can be anything from promoters to genes, allowing easy 
assembly and reassembly of parts into genetic circuits. The 2006 
jamboree consisted of 37 teams from 12 countries presenting their findings.

PSU iGEM
The Penn State team traditionally consists of several undergraduate 
student members working full time over the summer, and continuing part 
time into the fall term. Summer stipends can be obtained for students 
joining the team.  Some background in microbiology/molecular biology is 
helpful, but all that is required is enthusiasm, motivation, and 
excitement at developing this new field.  Students use the literature 
and laboratory work together to genetically engineer new biological 
"parts and systems".  The team was formed in 2005, and won the Best New 
Part award that year.  In 2006, Penn State again fared well, taking home 
Runner-up Best New Device award for work on a novel control of bacterial 
motility.
