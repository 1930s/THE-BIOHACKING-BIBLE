==Short Abstract==
Genome sequencing projects have increased exponentially our knowledge of
protein sequences. A full understanding of the biological roles of these
proteins can only be achieved by investigating their function and
structure.
 
Despite the structural genomic initiatives, computational inference using
an experimentally studied homolog is still the fastest way to gain
information about a proteins structure. In the absence of structurally
known homologs prediction becomes difficult as de novo based methods
cannot as yet compete with homolog based comparative modeling methods.
 
In the realm of function prediction when a protein has no homologous
neighbours with known function, the proteins interaction partners can be
used to decipher its function as
interacting proteins will tend to share similar functions.
Unfortunately such a method does not naturally extend into structure
prediction. Instead we propose a novel method that uses the protein
protein interaction network to identify the structure of the protein. We
upcast the protein network into a SCOP based domain-domain network, and
predict the fold of a query protein to be a fold in the fold network that
shows a similar interaction pattern. The algorithm is able to use
interaction data from multiple species and makes predictions to the
SUPERFAMILY level of SCOP.
