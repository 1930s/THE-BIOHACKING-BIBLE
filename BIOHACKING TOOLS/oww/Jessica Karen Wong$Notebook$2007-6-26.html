==To Do==
*Take out PCR and Digest
*PCR clean up
*Run analytic gel on PCR of I
*Make new Tet plates
*Re-plate devices
*Miniprep and digest 3K3
*Re-order T & E primers?
*PCR E and I on a gradient


Stopped PCR and heat shocked digest

Poured new Chlor LB plates

Nishant miniprepped and digested 3K3

==Gel of overnight PCR==
*Ran an analytic gel on I2055 PCR product see [[Endy:Agarose_gel|protocol]]
*No visible product
*Will PCR on a temperature gradient

==PCR Cleanup==
*PCR purified the 3 sucessful backbone digests (1AC3, 1AK3, 1AT3) and the PCR of I2055
*Had 50ul of each digest and 90ul of the PCR

==Designing Primers==
*New T9002 Reverse that matches only GFP '''TCAGCCAT ''ATGCAT''''' CCATGCCATGTGTAATCCCAG
**Melting Temp 55.0
*Original T9002_F '''CTTAGTAG ''CAATTG''''' TCCCTATCAGTGATAGAGATTGACATC has melting temp 53.9
Bold is the tail, italics is the restriction site.

*New Longer I2055
**Fwd- TATAAACGCAGAAAGGCCCACCC

*Original I2055     
** Fwd- CTTAGTAG + CAATTG + tccctatcagtgatagagattgacatc 
** Rev- TCAGCGAT + ATGCAT + TATAAACGCAGAAAGGCCCAC

==Gradient PCR==
*Did a 10ul analytic PCR of E0240 and I2055 on a gradient from 49 to 60
** E0240F melting temp - 53.1
**E0240R - 53.6
**I2055F - 53.9
**I2055R - 53.6
*Temperature in each of the 12 columns: 1st - 49, 2nd- 49.3, 3rd- 49.9, 4th-50.8, 5th-52.1, 6th- 53.7, 7th- 55.6, 8th- 57.2, 9th- 58.3, 10th- 59.2, 11th- 59.8, 12th- 60

==Plated Devices==
*From yesterday's overnight plates only saw colonies on blue C (RBS tester on Chlor)
*Spun down the rest of the cultures at 4k for 4 min
*Removed most of supernatant and resuspended in the remaining 100ul of LB
*Plated both devices on both Tet and Chlor

==Gel of Gradient PCR==
[[Image:07.06.26-2.jpg|thumb|left|Gel from 6/26/07]]
*Ran a 2 row 20-lane analytic gel
*  1. E0240 _ L _ _ 1 2 3 ...12 _ L _ _
*  2. I2055 _ _ L _ 1 2 3 ...12 _ _ L _
*E0240 has a bright band of reasonable length (slightly <1k)
*I2055 is very blurry and the brightest band is 3x longer than the part - very strange
