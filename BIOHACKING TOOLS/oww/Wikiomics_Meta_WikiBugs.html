=== Known bugs ===

==== "regular expression too large" ====
When you save a page, an error message like this appears:
 Warning: preg_match() [function.preg-match]: Compilation failed: regular expression too large at offset 0 in /data/www/wikiomics/extensions/SpamBlacklist/SpamBlacklist_body.php on line 119
This is because:
# The blacklist is too long and should be split into fragments. This bug of older versions of SpamBlacklist.
# Newer versions of SpamBlacklist are incompatible with the version of MediaWiki that we are using. We need to upgrade.
# The source code of SpamBlackList is horribly written, in a horrible language (PHP), an I am not used to spend so much time for a so tiny fix.
You must wait for the upgrade, which may not be simple.

However, it still saves pages, so you can still use the wiki, although it's very unconvenient.

Update: for now the quick fix was to use only the latest 1000 entries of the list (no, Iam not proud of it). It might not fight spam very well...

==== Email not working ====
Email confirmation, notification, etc seems to be broken at the moment.
Please be patient...

==== References disappearing ====
Occasionally all the PubMed or ISBN bibliographic references disappear: this is due to temporary connection problems to one of these services. It should happen only when a page is updated. The solution is to wait until their service is back. If it lasts too long, complain to them or suggest an equivalent server.
