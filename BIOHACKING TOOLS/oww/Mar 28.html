Agenda


place holder text:

James and John were interested in having a conversation on whether to move the Keasling lab over to the "standard form of making parts" that is in use at MIT, that if they wanted to use would have to be adapted for use in thi lab so a max no. of people could use it (and how to generate support for this kind of mode of working). They basically wanted to know if they could have this conversation with us in a detailed way. Of course they were clear that if we had an agenda then they are happy to follow our lead.
