** 1.7 g is approximately 1000 seeds
* Place in a smooth sterile flask
* Add 70% [[Wikipedia:ethanol|ethanol]] to substantially cover the seeds
** 70% [[Wikipedia:ethanol|ethanol]] is next to the scales
* Place on a shaker at room temperature at 150 rpm for 20 minutes
* Decant the [[Wikipedia:ethanol|ethanol]]  and wash the seeds once with sterile dH<sub>2</sub>0
* Add Clorox [[Wikipedia:bleach|bleach]] to substantially cover the seeds
* Place on a shaker at room temperature at 150 rpm for 20 minutes
* Decant the [[Wikipedia:bleach|bleach]] and wash the seeds 4 to 5 times with sterile dH<sub>2</sub>0
* Add sterile dH<sub>2</sub>0 to substantially cover the seeds
* Place on a shaker at room temperature at 150 rpm for at least 4 hours (preferably 8)
** It's a good idea to wash the seeds with sterile dH<sub>2</sub>0 once during this time
* Decant the sterile dH<sub>2</sub>0 and add fresh sterile dH<sub>2</sub>0
* Dump into 100Ã—25 mm Petri dishes
** Seeds should be in a monolayer with a small amount of space between them
* Pull off excess water with a pipet
