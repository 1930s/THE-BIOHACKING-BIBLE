==Overview==

This is a protocol for harvesting mouse liver tissue for [[ChIP|chromatin immunoprecipitation]]. <br>

==Reagents==
'''Buffer A (100mL total)'''<br>		
* 91mL of H2O<br>						
* 1.5mL of 1M Hepes<br>				
* 2mL of 3M KCl<br>			
* 300µL of 5M NaCl<br>					
* 40µL of 0.5M EDTA<br>					
* 100µL of 0.5M EGTA<br>						
* 16.2µL of 2.1M Sucrose<br>				
* 7.5µL of 2M BME<br>	
*5mL of 2.5M Glycine (to make 2.5M stock- 187.5 g/L)<br>
**A stock of Liver Buffer A can be made without BME or Glycine and stored at room temp. Add BME and Glycine before use.
<br>
'''Buffer B (100mL total)'''<br>
* 1.5mL of 1M Hepes<br>
* 2mL of 3M KCl<br>
* 300µm of 5M NaCl<br>		
* 20µm of 0.5M EDTA<br>		
* 20µm of 0.5M EGTA<br>		
* 100mL of 2.1M Sucrose<br>
<br>
'''Other'''
* Avertin (Anesthesia)
* PBS<br>
* PBS/1% Formaldehyde<br>
* 2.5M Glycine

==Supplies==
Surgical Instruments 
* Scissors
* Tweezers
* Bulldog clamp
* String

Other:
* 50mL conical tubes (1 per Liver)
* 2 of 10cc syringe
* 1 of 3cc syringe
* 26g needle
* Angiocatheter
* Ice with bucket

==Procedure==
===Harvest===
Total Time= ~20min/liver
* Open anaesthetized animal posterior to anterior
* Tie a loose knot of string around the superior vena cava in between the diaphragm and top of liver
* Tie a loose knot of string around the inferior vena cava 
* Insert catheter into inferior vena cava from posterior to anterior and secure with bulldog clamp making sure that the end of the catheter is anterior to the kidney junction
* Screw 10cc syringe with PBS onto catheter
* Tighten both knots and cut the portal vein
* Perfuse with PBS ''very''  slowly. (3-5 minutes)
* Switch syringes and ''slowly''  perfuse with 10cc PBS/formaldehyde
**The total time for both syringes of perfusion should be 5-10 minutes
* Cut diaphragm and remove liver
* Put liver into 50mL conical tube cap and dice into little pieces
* Incubate liver for 10 minutes and then add to 6mL glycine solution on ice

Notes: 
* Keep Buffer A on ice and PBS and PBS/formaldehyde in 30o water bath
* Do not use mice older than 3 months or if they are sick
* Harvest even numbers of animals- 2, 4, 6

===Hepatocyte Purification===                               
* Pour minced liver into dousing apparatus and rinse beaker with Buffer A and add to dounce
* Dounce until liquefied
* Filter through plastic filter and wash with Buffer A 
* Gently layer onto a 1.5mL cushion of 1:1 Buffer A and B in a Corex tube
* Centrifuge in fixed-angle rotor at 10,000rpm for 10min at 40 
* Decant and discard supernatant
* Gently resuspend pellet in 5-10mL PBS 
* Layer onto a 1.5mL cushion of 1:1 Buffer A and B in a Corex tube
* Centrifuge at 5,000rpm for 10min at 40
* Gently decant and discard supernatant 
* Resuspend pellet in 3mL of sonication buffer or resuspend pellet in 5mL of PBS or TBS, transfer to 15mL conical tube, centrifuge, decant supernatant and freeze pellet in  -800

Notes:
*Purification protocol should be done in the cold room on ice
