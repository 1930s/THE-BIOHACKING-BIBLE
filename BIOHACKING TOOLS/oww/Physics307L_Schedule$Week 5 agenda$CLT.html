=Central Limit Theorem=
==Experimentalist point of view==
===Assume there is some "parent distribution" for your possible experimental measurements===
===We want to estimate the mean of this parent distribution (why?)===
===[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers#A_weaker_law_and_proof Law of large numbers]===
===If we take a few measurements and average them: ''the average is the best guess for the mean of the parent population'' AND ''if we repeat this many times, our averages will have a normal distribution about the population mean''===
