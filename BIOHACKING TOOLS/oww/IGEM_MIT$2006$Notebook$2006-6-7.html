===Transport===
*SA can be transported into/out of tobacco cells (http://ejournal.sinica.edu.tw/bbas/content/1999/4/bot404-03.html)
*BA was added exogenously, and methyl benzoate (MB) was produced, so BA can enter ''E. coli''.  MB concentrations were measured without needing to lyse the cells, so MB '''can''' exit the cell.  ([[IGEM:MIT/2006/Notebook/2006-6-6#BAMT: SAM-Benzoic Acid Carboxyl Methyltransferase|Reference]]; it is the first paper under this section)
*In an experiment done by Horton et al., isoamyl alcohol was added exogenously and was taken up by the E. coli.  Concentration of the product, isoamyl acetate, was then measured without lysing the cells, so we know that the product will be excreted. (see Horton et al. paper in [[IGEM:MIT/2006/Notebook/2006-6-6#Alcohol_Acetyltransferase.28s.29:_ATF1_.26_ATF2|this section]].)
*In the Seo et al., paper, JA is converted to methyl jasmonate outside of a cell by the purified JMT protein product.  Thus, we do not know whether jasmonic acid can be taken up by E. coli. 

When discussing transport in plants, JA is a hormone that is freely flowing through the organisms.  Thus, JA is added to the cells exogenously in the naturally-occurring mechanism in plants.

*E. coli cells expressing C. breweri BEAT produced enzymatically active protein, and also synthesized benzylacetate and secreted it into the medium

Check out this picture for Salicylic Acid Biosynthesis from Phenalaline -- it is much more detailed and is linked into an excellent paper

====jasmonic acid====
*Many pathways described at http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1066929&blobtype=pdf

===Toxicity===
====BA====
*Immediately following exposure of ''E. coli'' to benzoate (20 mM = 2.42&mu;g/mL), the cell doubling rate reduced 10-fold (this is at pH 6.5; at pH 8.0, there is no significant change in doubling rate).  But we have to keep in mind that benzoate was not being metabolized, so benzoate was simply accumulating in the cell, affecting the pH (this is what was being studied, actually).  Methyl benzoate, since it is uncharged, may not have this same effect.
