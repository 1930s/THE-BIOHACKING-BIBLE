== Designing Parts or Genes ==
*Use Gene Designer from DNA 2.0. You can download this program for free [http://www.dna20.com/tools.php here].

== Overlapping Oligonucleotide Inserts==
*General Idea: use 4 overlapping oligonucleotides to generate a 85-120 bp insert
#Especially if you are making a sequence which is repetitive on the amino acid level, use Gene Designer to back-translate into an optimized DNA sequence.
#Add the 5' and 3' ends to your insert, then break this into four fragments.
## The first fragment will be 5'-CTAGA (first half of your insert).
## The second oligo will be 5'- complement of (first half of your insert + 6 bp)-T.
## The third oligo will be 5'-
