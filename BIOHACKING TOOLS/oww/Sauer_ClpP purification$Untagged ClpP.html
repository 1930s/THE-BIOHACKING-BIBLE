==Protocol==
 
*1.	Suspend cells expressing ClpP in 10mL/L culture of Buffer L150.

*2.	Freeze at -80&deg;C until use.

*3.	Thaw by addition of 10mL/L culture Buffer L150.

*4.	Add 1 mg/mL lysozyme, and let sit in ice, ~1 hour.

*5.	Sonicate to reduce viscosity. (or use DNase or Benzonase, they need Mg++ and Ca++)

*6.	Spin at 15K rpm in a SA-600 rotor, 30’.

*7.	Add AmSO<sub>4</sub> to 30% saturation (0.164 g/mL) while gently stirring on ice and incubate on ice for 30’.

*8.	Spin at 10K rpm, 15’; save supernatant.

*9.	Increase the AmSO<sub>4</sub> to 60% saturation (0.181 g/mL additional) while stirring on ice and incubate on ice 30’.

*10.	Spin at 10K rpm, 15’; save pellet.

*11.	Resuspend pellet in Buffer L150 (I used 5 mL per 1L culture but this was more than I needed:[[User:Marylee|Marylee]]).

*11a.    Alternately, you can resuspend the pellet in "saltless" buffer.   At 60% saturation, there is ~2.7 M AmSO<sub>4</sub>, so the remainder in the pellet volume contibutes plenty of salt. Resuspending in 20-30 pellet volumes will allow you to go directly to the anion exchange column without wasting PD-10 columns.  If you do this, spin the resuspension to clear it if insoluble material before the anion exchange step.

*12.	Desalt into a PD-10 column (with fresh Buffer L150) or decrease conductivity by dilution into L150.

*13.	''HiLoad 16/10 Q Sepharose HP separation.''  The mobile phase contains Buffer L150 and elution proceeds with a 200 mL linear gradient between 150mM and 400 mM KCl.

*14.	Concentrate sample by precipitation in 60% AmSO<sub>4</sub> (0.361 g/mL), and then incubate on ice for 30’.

*15.	Spin at 10K rpm and resuspend in Buffer L100.

*16.	''Gel filtration using a HiPrep Sephacryl S-300HR column'' in Buffer L100.

*17.	Concentrate fractions on a HiLoad 16/10 Q Sepharose column or by a spin concentrator.

==Notes==
To Avoid sonication, you can use DNase or Benzonase to reduce viscosity.  Change the lysis buffer to contain Mg++ and Ca++ if you do.  After treatment, add EDTA to chelate the metal and continue with the prep.

You can make a "5X" stock buffer:  125 mM HEPES-Tris, 2.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.6.  Buffers are stronger and less sensitive to dilution if they are composed of paired buffers with pKas flanking the desired pH.  HEPES ~7.4 and Tris ~8.1.  Start with the buffer with a pK closest to your desired pH (125 mM HEPES in this case) and add Tris base until the pH is 7.6.  

Make a 1 M KCl solution with 1/50th vol. of the 5X buffer above and adjust the pH to 7.6.  Then making your 100, 150, and 400 mM buffers is a matter of mixing.
