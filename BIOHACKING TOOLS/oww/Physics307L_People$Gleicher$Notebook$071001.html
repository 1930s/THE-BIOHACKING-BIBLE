{{SJK comment|label=15:45, 15 October 2007 (CDT)|comment=You should have asked me or Devon if you couldn't find image of the slit!  Or perhaps someone who had done the lab previously.<br><br>Overall, the notes you have in your notebook are good, but they are too sparse.  Try to imagine coming back to your notebook one year from now and piecing together what you did...I think you would have a hard time.  Or imagine worse yet, someone who hasn't seen the apparatus yet!}}
Setting up apparatus:
To begin with I adjusted the ocular to get the image of the crosshairs into focus. The instructions in the lab manual say to adjust the focus of the telescope until the slit in the apparatus becomes visible, but this was difficult as I could not actually find an image of the slit at all.

Calibration of the Spectrometer:

To calibrate the instrument I noted the locations on the dial of the lines corresponding to Mercury.

Violet - 436 nm, 435 nm, 434.6 nm
Green - 545 nm ,544.6 nm, 544 nm
Yellow - 577.1 nm, 576.1 nm, 570 nm
Cannot see red

{{SJK comment|label=15:40, 15 October 2007 (CDT)|comment=Some comments about your excel sheet.  You can use "average" and "stdev" functions to save a lot of time in typing in formulae.  I think you caculated the standard deviation incorrectly...}}
Was unable to find Na
