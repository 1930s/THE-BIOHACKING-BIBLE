My most recent students conduct research in field of synthetic biology. I have a few related student projects underway as part of our NSF-funded grant Synthetic Biology Research for Undergraduate (SyBR-U). We meet weekly to discuss the interactions between math and biology during our BioMath Connections video conference with collaborators at Missouri Western State University.

For the [[Davidson_Missouri_W |iGEM2007 team]], 6 students worked at Davidson College (Oyinade Adefuye {NCCU student}, [[Will DeLoache |Will DeLoache]], [[Jim Dickson |Jim Dickson]], [[Andrew Martens |Andrew Martens]], Amber Shoecraft {JCSU student}, and [[Mike Waters |Mike Waters]]) worked in collaboration with students at Missouri Western State University to design and build a bacterial computer that could solve the Hamiltonian Path Problem: given a directed graph (see below), is it possible to visit every node exactly once when starting and stopping at particular nodes?

We all learned a lot, and in the end it appears we were successful in our project. Cells flipped the DNA and presented the appropriate phenotypes.

In the summer of 2006, 3 students ([[Erin Zwack |Erin]], Sabriya, and Lance) began an exciting new project to construct an ''E. coli'' computer. You can read more about their work from the Davidson team's [[Davidson:Davidson_iGEM_2006 |wiki page]] or viewing their [http://www.bio.davidson.edu/Courses/Synthetic/iGEM2006/iGEM2006_Davidson.ppt iGEM 2006 presentation]. The key was to integrate biology and mathematics. This project continued in the fall of 2006 when [[Samantha Simpson |Samantha]] and [[Dr. Karmella Haynes |Karmella]] took over preparations for the 2006 iGEM competition at MIT. The project was done in collaboration with [http://parts2.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/Missouri_Western_State_University_2006 Missouri Western State University]. One product of the summer was a new web site that helps investigators synthesize short genes from a series of oligos. The web site, created by Lance, [http://gcat.davidson.edu/IGEM06/oligo.html facilitates choosing the right oligos to make]. Davidson won prizes in 4 categories at the 2006 iGEM competion.
