==Protocol==
#Grow 5 ml yeast to early log phase (5 x 10<sup>6</sup> – 1 x 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml)
#Move 5 ml culture from glass tube to 15 ml conical. Add 700 μl 37% formaldehyde, seal the tube with parafilm, and incubate at 30°C for 1 h
#Pellet cells, 2 min at 2,500 rpm, wash 2 x 5 ml 0.1 M phosphate buffer and 1 x 5 ml Solution P
#Resuspend pellet in 1 ml Solution P, cells can be stored at 4 °C for a while
#Take 500 μl of your cells, add DTT to 25 mM (12.5 µl) and incubate at 30°C for 10 min.
#Pellet cells, 2 min at 2,500 rpm and resuspend with 500 μl Solution P
#Add 20 μl zymolyase (10 mg/ml) and 10 μl lyticase (Resuspend 50,000 units lyticase (one bottle) in 1 ml ddH<sub>2</sub>O) for every 500 µl cells. Incubate at 30°C on rotator, 10-20 min is a good time range.
#While zymolyasing, coat slide wells with 0.1% polylysine. Incubate 10 min at RT. Rinse 2x with ddH<sub>2</sub>O and air dry.
#Pellet cells, 1 min, 2,500 rpm and resuspend gently in 500 μl of Solution P
#Wash 2 x 500 μl of Solution P
#Apply 20 μl cell suspension to each well, incubate 5 min RT
#Gently aspirate off the excess cells and permeablize them with 20 µl 0.5% Triton-X 100 in Solution P for 5 min.
#Aspirate off Triton and rinse 1 x 500 μl with Solution P
#Block cells in antibody blocking buffer for 30 min to 1 h at RT
#Add primary antibody diluted into antibody blocking buffer and incubate overnight at 4°C
#Wash wells (RT):
#*Ab wash #1 for 10 min
#*Ab wash #1 for 30 min
#*Ab wash #2 for 10 min
#*Ab wash #2 for 30 min
#Add secondary antibody diluted in antibody blocking buffer, 1 h RT
#Repeat washes (from step 16)
#Stain nuclei with DAPI solution for 5 min at RT in the dark (DAPI stock = 1 mg/ml, 1000x, dilute in PBS)
#Wash cells 2 x 5 min in the dark with Antibody wash #2
#Aspirate off Antibody wash #2 and let air dry in the dark for a few minutes
#Apply VectaShield mounting medium (prewarmed to RT), apply coverslip, and seal with clear nail polish
#Publish results in ''Cell''
