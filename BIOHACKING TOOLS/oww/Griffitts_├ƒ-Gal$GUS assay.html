{{Griffitts}}
==Procedure==
# Grow cultures overnight to saturation.
# Sub-culture 1:10 into fresh media. Cells can be spun down and re-suspended in fresh media for increased experimental control or sub-cultured directly from saturated cultures. Sub-culturing can be done in triplicate. 
# Let the sub-cultures grow for 3-4 hours. If you are planning on letting the sub-culture grow longer make the dilution greater. The cells need to be actively growing and have and OD<sub>600</sub> of ~1.000 when assayed, so sub-culture accordingly. 
# Take the culture of cells that is expected to have the greatest activity and add 5-50 µL to a pilot [[Wikipedia:Laboratory centrifuge#Microcentrifuge tube|Eppendorf]] containing 700 µL of [[Griffitts:ß-Gal/GUS assay#Master Mix|Master Mix]] and 50 µL of [[Wikipedia:chloroform|chloroform]]. Wait for the pilot tube to turn yellow. Based on this information you can recalculate how many µL of cells to add and how long to let the assay go. Remember that the cells have still been growing (for about 30 min or more) while you have been doing the pilot test.
# Add 700 µL of [[Griffitts:ß-Gal/GUS assay#Master Mix|Master Mix]] to each [[Wikipedia:Laboratory centrifuge#Microcentrifuge tube|Eppendorf]] to be used in the assay.
# Add 50 µL of [[Wikipedia:chloroform|chloroform]] to each [[Wikipedia:Laboratory centrifuge#Microcentrifuge tube|Eppendorf]].
# Add 5-50 µL of cells to each [[Wikipedia:Laboratory centrifuge#Microcentrifuge tube|Eppendorf]] and vortex thoroughly. The amount added should be based on the results of the pilot test. When adding cells make sure to insert the pipette tip into the assay solution of [[Griffitts:ß-Gal/GUS assay#Master Mix|Master Mix]] and [[Wikipedia:chloroform|chloroform]]. Count the seconds (10-15 seconds, usually) between each addition of cells to assay. The assay begins when the cells are added and needs to be stopped in the same order and timing to ensure accurate results.
# Incubate the assay at room temperature (to slow down fast reactions) or at 37°C (preferred reaction temperature) for between 15 min. and a few hours (temperature and time are reaction specific and should be based on the pilot test).
# Stop the reaction with 700 µL 1M NaCO<sub>3</sub> (stop solution) and vortex briefly. Be sure to add stop solution in the same order the cells were added and with the same count in between each addition of stop solution as addition of cells (10-15 seconds). The assay stops when stop solution is added. Note the amount of time the assay ran.
# Centrifuge the assay, and obtain the OD<sub>405</sub> of the supernatant.
# Obtain the OD<sub>600</sub> of the sub-cultures. 
# Calculate [[Griffitts:ß-Gal/GUS assay#Miller Units|Miller Units]].
==Master Mix==
Make fresh the same day as the sub-cultures and store on ice:
* 700 µL of Basal Buffer
* 0.6 µL of substrate ([[Wikipedia:ortho-Nitrophenyl-β-galactoside|o-NPG]] for [[Wikipedia:β-galactosidase|β-Gal]], p-NPG for [[Wikipedia:GUS reporter system|GUS]])
Vortex until all the substrate is dissolved–this can take several minutes.
* 0.25 µL 20% [[Wikipedia:Sodium dodecyl sulfate|SDS]]<br>
* 2 µl BME ([[Wikipedia:β-Mercaptoethanol|β-Mercaptoethanol]])
Note: Make this mix in a factor greater than 20x due to the small amounts of substrate in the mix.
==Miller Units==
mu = [1000 / [T(min)*Vol(mL)]] * [OD<sub>405</sub> / OD<sub>600</sub>]
* T = minutes assay ran
* Vol = volume of cells added (5-50 µL)
