==First lab period for experiment==
''If necessary: finish oral exam of previous lab''
# In wiki lab notebook: prepare for experiment.  Write up a purpose, what underlying physics is used / tested, the measurements you will attempt to take, and the major equipment you will use.  You don't have to write everything (or even much at all) from scratch: linking to pre-exsiting material is great (make sure the links won't disappear, though).  
#* Before starting experiment, preparatory writeup will be approved by Koch.
#* You should have a clear idea of what you want to accomplish
# Perform experiments
#* Take diligent notes of everything! (use <nowiki>~~~~</nowiki> to time and date stamp everything)
#* Revisions to original plan are fine -- add them as new notes (make sure to add your signature)
#* Perform cursory analysis of data to see if you have all you need

==Home work==
# Begin to analyze data carefully (record all your steps and results!)
#* Attempt to obtain "final" results (with error bars)!
#* Make note of problems and what data needs to be retaken or what further data needs to be obtained.
# Make note of further bonus experiments you think of

==Second lab period for experiment==
# Repeat experiments as necessary, perform new experiments
# Finish careful data analysis
#* Make note of final results, with error bars.
# Summarize experiment
#* What physics was tested, and when was this experiment first attempted (links to wikipedia or elsewhere are great)?
#* What instrumentation was used?
#* What are the final best measurements, with error bars?
#** How good are the data?  How does it compare to the expected answer?
#** What do you know could be improved (with or without money)
#** How sure are you of your measurements? (qualitatively and quantitatively)
#* What was the biggest challenge?
#* What would you recommend for the next student?
# Oral defense of lab notebook and final summary
