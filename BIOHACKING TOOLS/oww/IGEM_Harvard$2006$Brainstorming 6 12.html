<b> DNA nanostructures </b>
* opening/closing dynamically using DNA sticky ends or DNA binding protein, investigating protein design
* make a tight box
* making a latch to be opened by a certain receptor
<b> Global warming </b>
* cyanobacteria - circadian oscillator -> synthetic oscillator
* neurospora - light sensitive repressor
<b> Computer Analogies </b>
* Memory
** plasmid memory, memory management, garbage collection/mark and sweep
** addressable
* Counter
** telomeres, buffer with red flourescent protein or a self-destruction sequence
* Cryptography
** fold DNA nanostructure - key is native strand of DNA in one cell, message of oligomers sent to that cell
* Debugger 
** something before the reporter
** making a bunch of parameters and seeing what we can get
** perhaps working a debugger into our specific system
<b> Alternative splicing </b>
* Hijacking commensal bacteria 
* Yogurt - lactobacillusacidophillus
<b> Ftsk translocase </b>
* simple manipulations of DNA, spitting DNA into media
<b> Fuel production </b>
* Ethanol in yeast or E.coli
<b> Biobricks in eukaryotes </b>
* protein domain system (MCB 100 work)
<b> Message Relay System </b>
* Passing molecules 
* Assembling messages
