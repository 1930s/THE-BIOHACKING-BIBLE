==Purpose==
Used as the electrophoresis buffer during denaturing (via glyoxal) agarose gel electrophoresis of RNA.

==Components==
*100 mM PIPES
*300 mM Bis-Tris
*10 mM EDTA

The final pH of this 10x buffer is ~6.5. 

==Procedure==
#Prepare by adding the following to 90 ml of distilled H<sub>2</sub>O
#*3 g of PIPES (free acid)
#*6 g of Bis-Tris (free base)
#*2 ml of 0.5 M EDTA 
#Treat the solution with final concentration of 0.1% DEPC for 1 hour at 37Â°C
#Autoclave.
