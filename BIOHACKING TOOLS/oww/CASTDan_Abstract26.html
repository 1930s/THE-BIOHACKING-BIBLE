Abstract:

<br>Two prototype 24-unit microbioreactors are
presented and reviewed for their relative merits. The first
used a standard 24-well plate as the template, while the
second consisted of 24-discrete units. Both systems used
non-invasive optical sensors to monitor pH and dissolved
oxygen. The systems were used to cultivate Escherichia
coli. Both designs had their merits and the results
obtained are presented. In addition, dissolved oxygen
control was demonstrated at the milliliter scale and
24 simultaneously monitored fermentations were successfully
carried out. These results demonstrated high
quality high throughput bioprocessing and provide
important insights into operational parameters at small
scale.
