The crystal violet assay is great to quantify biofilm formation quickly in a high-throughput way for single- and multiple-strain biofilms. Nevertheless, we want to look at the strain composition in each biofilm in a high. For this, we need to disrupt the biofilm back into suspended cells so that we can quantify their relative amounts through fluorescence.

== Biofilm disruption solution ==
* 1% SDS [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_dodecyl_sulfate Sodium dodecyl sulfate] (denaturates protein)
* 5 mM [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edta EDTA]
* 100 mM NaCl
* 50 mM [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tris Tris], pH 7.4, [[Tris | how to prepare]]

== Protocol ==
* Grow biofilm in 96-well plate.
* Extract liquid (measure OD if necessary) and wash twice.
* Fill with 150 Î¼m disruption solution.
* Shake for 30 mins.
* Measure OD.
* Measure fluorescences.
