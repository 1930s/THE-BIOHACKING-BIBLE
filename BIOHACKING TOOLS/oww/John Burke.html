'''John Burke''' (BE postdoctoral), in collaboration with Peter Sorger (MIT Biology), Jack Beusmans (AstraZeneca), and Birgit Schoeberl (Merrimack Pharmaceutical).

Mathematical modeling, analysis, and simulation of cellular signaling pathways and protein synthesis. Working closely with experimentalists and computational biologists I derive, from first principles, and study math models describing biological systems. I use dynamical systems, multiple time-scale, singular and random perturbation techniques to analyze and mathematically control these systems. I then use simulations to verify analysis. Systems of interest include: generalized MAPK cascades; specific Erk and AKT cascades with cross talk; ErbB Receptor activation, trafficking, synthesis and degradation; Apoptosis/TNF signaling; and mutant ErbB signaling.
