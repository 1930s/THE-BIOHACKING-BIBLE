==CD2-T and T-1 send to sequencing==

==T1TE and T1T2==
T1TE digestion by ClaI/SalI and T1T2 digestion by NotI/XhoI, then rescued.

==LacZa-plx009 miniprep==
NdeI and XhoI digestion using H buffer, send to sequencing.

==sequencing result==
plx008 is right

plx009-5 turned out to be plx003!!!

So actually we have already constructed lacZa-Plx003!

But there is still some problems with enzymatic digestion results.

We will change our construction plan due to this result!

==plx006 digestion using XhoI and H buffer==

result: plx006 can not be cut by XhoI wihout any known reason.

==CD2, RD3, RS3, CD3 PCR and rescue==
using relevant primers to PCR and then rescue by gel.

==plx007/8 transform JM110/DH5a

==T1TE and T1T2 ligate with pcc010==
4 degrees in fridge overnight with a concentration ratio of 4:1 between fragment and vector
