OLD IDEA
Slide 1: Motivation
Figure for Slide 1: picture of epitope binding once, twice, dimerization!
# the vision was to use antigen binding as a means of initiating a signal
# dimerization induced signal seemed an optimal type of pathway do this:
#* if the act of dimerization initiates downstream effects, all we need to do is induce the dimerization event
#* avoiding complicated, messy biology!

Slide 2: Why Tox?
Figure for Slide 2: Device Diagram for Tox System
# Did not find outermembrane system that initiates a signal by dimerization (would have used that)
# Did find ToxR from v. cholera. Relevant characteristics:
#*directly initiates signal upon dimerization (ctx)
#*dimerizing protein chimeras have been made 
#*relativly well understood system
#*(con) located on inner membrane
#**This means we're restricted to antigens that can get inside the cell
# Where did we get? -- Show construction on diagram --

Transition
In parallel to the construction of the Tox system, we also worked on building another system that, though much more complex, does reside on the outer membrane and can thus interact with the cell's environment -- Here is Annie to talk about the Fec system.

note: depending on various constraints, microscope pictures might be included, if we want to talk more about what we did.
