Drew, Caitlin, and Jen,

We received 11 boxes from the Endy Lab on the 10th.
Those are now in the inventory (but not double checked).

At the bottom of that page, you will see the "Status of the repository."
At this time, there are 189 parts that are designated as Available, but
are not in our inventory. About 50 are from the MIT 2004 team.
About 20 are fluorescent parts.

Under twins, you will see that there are 6 parts that have an available twin.
We also have 15 Length OK parts and 5 parts that are recorded as Building.

Randy
