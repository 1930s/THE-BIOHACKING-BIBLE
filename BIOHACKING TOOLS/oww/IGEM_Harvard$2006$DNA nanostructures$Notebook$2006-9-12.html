==Designed and Ordered Aptamer Oligos for c5.0==
* Since the streptavidin-biotinylation protection assay showed success, and since our original plan was to work with a more ''in vivo'' useful biological pairing (ie. thrombin to thrombin-aptamer), I thought it would be a good idea to order the appropriate thrombin-aptamer-containing oligos for a protection assay. 

* We only need 10 new oligos, without biotinylation obviously, so they're not too expensive - better to have them on hand when we need them than have to wait for them later.

* Used the convention from c4.0 of: '''original (split) sequence''' (taken from the sequences of the biotinylated revised oligos c5.0.8r and c5.0.9r), '''3Ts''', followed by the thrombin-aptamer sequence '''ggttggtgtggttgg'''.



* See [[IGEM:Harvard/2006/Container_Design_5/Oligos#Aptamer_Oligos_.289.2F12.29|Notebook on 9.12]] for the sequences ordered, and what oligos from older orders will be needed to add to them.


* Order was sent to Alain 4:55PM 9.12.06.
