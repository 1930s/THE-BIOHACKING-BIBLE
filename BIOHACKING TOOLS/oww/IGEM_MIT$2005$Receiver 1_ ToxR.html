'''Receiver Device #1 -- ToxR'''

==POC==
wiki-Will
8/18 - i'm out of town today and maybe a few more days. Possibly through the end of the week. the parents just sort of showed up!

==Function==
To cause gene expression in the presence of input signal using the ToxR pathway.

Information path ...
# Fluoroscein introduced to system (as Fluoroscein+DNAspacer+Fluoroscein), travels into periplasm.
# Fluoroscein binds to adjacent transmembrane ToxR'-scFv fusions .
## Causes ToxR' dimerization
# GFP expressed @ CTX_promoter
## As a function of ToxR dimerization

People path ...
# Maxine gives us Fluoroscein, or identifies something else
# Maxine's antigen binds to Jenny's scFv
# Then, Jenny's scFv induces Will's ToxR' to dimerize
# The dimerization leads to the expression of Jessica's output @ CTXpromoter [cI, maybe]
# Ray makes the whole system look like "we meant to do that."
# Jen.

==Device Parts==
                 Composite Parts for the first run of tests.

*Move contents to respective place.

==Current Status==
# In the process of verifying that we can get our signal into the periplasm (in lab)
# Part creation ...
## working out kinks in PhoA, malE isolation.
## soon ordering promotor-RBS tandem biobrick
# Continue research on putting scFv onto outermembrane of cell.

==Open Issues/Questions==
# The periplasm 
## Is the signal going in? 
## Are our scFv's going to come out (to the surface)?
# we won't know til we try! unless...
