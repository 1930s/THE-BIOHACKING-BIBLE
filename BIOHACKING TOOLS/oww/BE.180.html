'''Welcome to BE.180, MIT Biological Engineering's programming course!''' For many of you this will be the first time learning to program computers; others may already be programming gurus.  Regardless of your background, upon completing BE.180 you'll have learned how to solve complex biological engineering problems using computational approaches.  You'll also discover the rudiments of how to program DNA, the genetic material that runs inside all living organisms.  Along the way, you'll be exposed to powerful ideas that underlie all of modern engineering.  We hope that you have a great experience with the course!
