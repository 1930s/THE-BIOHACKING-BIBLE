==Key Questions==
#What proportion of newly synthesized proteins fail to fold, and why?
#How do cells tell when a protein is misfolded, rather than simply in the process of folding?  Do cells actually make such distinctions?
#What is the cost of producing a protein that misfolds, compared to the cost if that protein folds properly?
#Why are misfolded proteins costly?
#How does inaccuracy in the translational apparatus (ribosomes, aa-tRNA synthetases, etc.) shape the evolution of coding sequences and proteins?
