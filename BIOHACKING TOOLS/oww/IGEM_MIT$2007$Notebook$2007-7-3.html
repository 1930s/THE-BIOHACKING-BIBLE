==Wet Work==
*All plates look like sludge
**Not sure why
**Could be need to use LB+KAN for recovery step
**Plating with 1000 µl instead of 100 µl


==Make LB+KAN agar plates==
#Heat LB+KAN agar plates
#*Heat LB + Agar 1.2% for 10 minutes at 50% power
#*Wait until cool to touch and put in 960(???) µL Kanamycin to make 10 µg/ml concentration
#*Pour into labeled plates

==Incubate 5 colonies of DB3.1 strain with pSB3k3 plasmid (with Kan+)==
*Started at 6pm (spinning in hot room)
** +18 hours = done 12pm tomorrow

==Incubated plates of DH5a==
*Francois kindly gave us two plates of untransformed DH5a because our own line is probably compromised
*Incubated plates at 37°C overnight
