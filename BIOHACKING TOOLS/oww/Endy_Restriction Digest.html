==Materials==

*Prepped DNA.  For a BioBrick assembly (and possibly any cloning operation) 300 ng is more than enough.

*Restriction enzymes ([http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/productR0101.asp EcoR I], [http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/productR0133.asp Spe I], [http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/productR0145.asp Xba I] or [http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/productR0140.asp Pst I])

*Restriction buffers (also from New England Biolabs. [http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/tech_reference/restriction_enzymes/buffer_activity_restriction_enzymes.asp? source])
**For all combinations of the four BioBrick enzymes, we use Buffer 2 + BSA.
*ddH<sub>2</sub>O

==Digest Mix==
*0.2-1&mu;g DNA from prep or PCR
* 10% (by volume) Restriction Buffer
* 1% (by volume) BSA stock
* 2.5% - 5% (by volume) of each restriction enzyme.
* ddH<sub>2</sub>O to produce correct percentages by volume
*Enzymes < 10% of total volume so glycerol is < 5% of total volume.

We prepare a restriction digest supermix (stored at -20C) containing - 
*5*'''n''' &mu;l of Buffer 2
*0.5*'''n''' &mu;l of BSA
*37*'''n''' &mu;l of ddH<sub>2</sub>O
where '''n''' is the desired number of 50&mu;l reactions.

===Example - 50&mu;l digest===

*42.5&mu;l of restriction digest supermix
*1-5&mu;l of preppedDNA
*1&mu;l of each restriction enzyme

==Reaction conditions==
*Incubate reaction at 37&deg;C for at least 1 hour; longer digest gives more complete digestion, especially if you have >1Âµg DNA, but can at times give nonspecific digestion, even if glycerol is <5%.  Heat kill enzymes at 80C for 20 min.
*Store at -20&deg;C.

==Notes==
*On improving the efficiency of [[EcoRI/SpeI Double Digest]].
*At glycerol concentrations > 5%, star activity is sometimes observed (meaning that the enzyme cuts at places other than its recognition site).
