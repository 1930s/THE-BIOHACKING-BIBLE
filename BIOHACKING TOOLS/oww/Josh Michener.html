==Research==
My research focuses on applying RNA switches, developed elsewhere in the lab, to provide dynamic control of enzymatic pathways. Specifically, I am using those switches to construct feedback control systems, with the goal of producing a predictable output despite variations in reaction conditions. These control systems can then be used in metabolic engineering to change both the transient and equilibrium responses of a pathway.

==Past Projects==
*Development of an ''in vivo'' screen for synthetic riboswitches.
*Design and construction of a [[Endy:Screening plasmid|screening plasmid]] to measure the PoPS transfer curve of a [http://parts.mit.edu BioBricks] device.
