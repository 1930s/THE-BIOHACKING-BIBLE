The efficiency of a 1:1 mixture of commercial and homemade cell extract was tested in an effort to conserve the commercial one due to its high cost. Given that this 1:1 mixture works, we can use effectively double the amount of reactions we can perform with our current stock of commercial cell extract.

Unfortunalely the results proved that this '''1:1 mixture does not work !'''
