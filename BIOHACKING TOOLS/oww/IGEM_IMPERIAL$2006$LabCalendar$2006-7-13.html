===Electroporation===
*Raise voltage to about 2.2 to 2.3 V, the other knobs should already be set
*Ensure the pulse controller is set at 200

Ensure:
*No sample with high salt concentration, will cause to spark
*Sample must be even across cuvette
*Make sure the cuvette is dry!
*You can use the cuvette several times (wash about 10 times with tap water and a few times with distilled water...place in 37C incubator to dry and set to autoclave for sterilisation)

*Cool cuvettes (prechill) on ice before using
*Always have a control to ensure that there is no noise when getting results

*Competant bacteria are kept in -80C freezer down the corridor (bring your swipecard!)
*Leave bacteria on ice 
*Make sure bacteria are thawed
*Pipette all of the 50 uL aliquot of bacteria after mixing with a pipette, ensure that there are no bubbles in the cuvette!
*If you get a spark, throw the curvette away and start again, clear the machine by pressing both buttons again until it beeps (releases charge)

After electroporation
*Put 1 mL of LB (no antibiotic) pipette a few times and transfer to an eppendorf
*Take to lab and spin for 10 seconds
*Pippete off most of the liquid and resuspend
*Transfer to agar plate and allow to grow
