Is grid computing <cite>wikipedia</cite> in the field of bioinformatics more than a buzzword? 

== Biomolecular simulations ==
The aim of the [http://www.biosimgrid.org BioSimGrid] project <cite>biosimgrid2004</cite> is to make the results of large-scale computer simulations of biomolecules more accessible to the biological community.

== Folding@Home Distributed Computing ==
[http://folding.stanford.edu/ Folding@Home] is a distributed computing project in which people all over the world download and run software on their PC's to create one of the largest supercomputers that has ever been used to predict protein folding.

== MyGrid ==

[http://www.mygrid.org.uk/ MyGrid] aims to use the power of grid computing to "provide middleware layers that make it appropriate for the immediate needs of bioinformatics".
