===Background===

The rational design of integrated biological systems requires a set of characterized, compatible components. Here we attempt to improve the characterization of a set of transcriptional promoters contained in the registry of standard biological parts. We measure the relative strength of sixteen promoters via expression of a YFP reporter, measured by flow cytometry and plate reader.
