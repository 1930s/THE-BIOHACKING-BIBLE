''This is our protocol for making [[M9 medium/minimal|minimal M9 medium]].''

==Component Concentrations==
*1x [[M9 salts]]
*2mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>
*0.1mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>
*0.4% carbon source (e.g. glycerol, glucose, etc.)
*In sterile H<sub>2</sub>O

==Protocol==
For 1L of media
*500ml 2x[[M9 salts]] &lowast;
*20ml 0.1M MgSO<sub>4</sub> &lowast;
*200&mu;l 0.5M CaCl<sub>2</sub> &lowast;
*469.8ml sterile deionized H<sub>2</sub>O &lowast; (if carbon source to be added)
*479.8ml sterile deionized H<sub>2</sub>O &lowast; (if no carbon source to be added, useful as a control for sugar metabolism)

Combine above solutions using sterile technique.  (May notice some precipitation during preparation but precipitate should go back into solution once volume is brought up to 1l with sterile H<sub>2</sub>O.)<br>
Add antibiotic as appropriate and store at 4&deg;C
