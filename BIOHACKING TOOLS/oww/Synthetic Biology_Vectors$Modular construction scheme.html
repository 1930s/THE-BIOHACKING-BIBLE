==Summary==

In order to both save on construction costs and facilitate generation of a larger library of vectors in the future, an extensible vector scaffold was designed.  This scaffold serves as the basis for the [[Synthetic Biology:Vectors/pSB**5 design|pSB**5]] series of plasmids.

The scaffold is designed such that 
#It can be propagated and selected via ampicillin resistance by itself.
#Replication origins and antibiotic resistance markers specified in BioBricks format can be assembled and   cloned into the vector scaffold thereby constructing a new pSB**5 plasmid.
#After insertion of the replication origin and antibiotic resistance marker, all BioBricks sites and BioBricks compatible sites are destroyed enabling their future reuse for other purposes.

==Design overview==

The vector scaffold contains two [http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/productR0131.asp NheI] sites flanking an ampicillin resistance marker.  A replication origin.resistance marker composite BioBrick part can be cut with XbaI and SpeI and cloned into the vector scaffold at the NheI sites thereby replacing the ampicillin resistance marker.  All XbaI/SpeI/NheI sites are destroyed in the process.

==Implementation==
