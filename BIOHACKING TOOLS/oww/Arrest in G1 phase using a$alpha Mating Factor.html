'''Protocol'''

1)  Grow yeast culture to desired density.

2)  Add yeast mating factor to a final concentration of 2.5 ug/mL.
 If growing a-type yeast, use alpha mating factor.  For alpha-type yeast, use a mating factor.

3)  Incubate at 30 C for 3 hours.  The yeast should form "shmoos" and look pear-shaped once arrested.
