==iGEM Poetry==

===An Ode to E.coli===


Two cells of E. coli were wandering slowly

Down the gastrointestinal tract.

An F+ was he, an F- was she,

And their membranes were bound to attract.


Now the dainty F- was born in a sinus

Where her members did seldom trespass,

But the brawnt F+ was spawned in some pus,

And produced both acid and gas.


A kiss he had stolen, down deep in the colon;

"Don't touch me", she said, "or I'll scream!

I have no protection, and an F+ infection

Would spoil my maidenly dream."


So the poor lonely fella withdrew his flagella

And worshipped her from afar;

"At least", he said, "wait, till I can mutate

And come back an HFR."
