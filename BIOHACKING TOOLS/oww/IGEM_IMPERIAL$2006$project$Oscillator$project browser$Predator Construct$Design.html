==Registry==
*2 parts have been designed to fullfil the specifications:
:*a monocystronic: <bbpart>BBa_J37035</bbpart>
::[[Image:J37035 parts pic.PNG]]
:*a polycystronic: <bbpart>BBa_J37036</bbpart>
::[[Image:J37036 parts pic.PNG]]

==Design choices==

*We need to fulfill all the properties listed in the '''specifications'''.
*Based on the '''Quorum-sensing/quenching''' due to biochemical properties needed and BioBricks availability.
*Following the design of the '''[[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2006/project/Oscillator/project browser/Prey_Construct | Prey-construct]]''', the prey molecule is an homoserine-lactone (AHL).
*Due to the biochemical constrains, the predator has to be decoupled into 3 modules:
**'''Sensing module''' driven by the dimer formed between AHL and LuxR and its affinity to the pLux promoter.
**'''Killing module''' driven by the use of the lactonase aiiA.
**'''Natural death of the predator''' molecule.

! FUNCTIONS !! biological component !! comments
|-
| Prey Sensing|| pLux promoter  <bbpart>BBa_R0062</bbpart>  || The pLux promoter allows us to get the growth of the predator to be function of the population of prey-molecules and predator-molecules.
|-
| Prey Killing|| Enzymatic reaction || Enzymatic reaction from aiiA on AHL .
|-
| Predator Death|| Growth dilution || Bacterials will be washed out from the chemostat, so will be the LuxR and aiiA inside the bacterials, and this should be much more dominant than LuxR and aiiA's natural degrdation rate
|}

==Open issues==

*Testing should be done to distinguish between the monocystronic and polycystronic construct (maybe their transfer functions are different)
*If the degradation rates of LuxR and aiiA are different, it will introduce an asymmetry in the system.
*The aiiA BioBrick in the Registry has never been properly tested and validated.
