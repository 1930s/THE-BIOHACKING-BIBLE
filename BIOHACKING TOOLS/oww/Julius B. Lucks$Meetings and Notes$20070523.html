= Protein Evolutionary Rates =

* dS = # synonymous changes per site
* dN = # non-synonymous changes per site
* calculate these quantities by comparing coding sequences of similar organisms that have diverged (S. ceriviciae and S. bayanus diverged 20 million years ago)
* Drummond, PNAS, 2005 <cite> Drummond-PNAS-2005 </cite>
** dN has a range of several orders of magnitude
** what is known is that highly expressed proteins evolve slowly (small dN)
** expression level, CAI, abundance, # interactions, length, network centrality, fitness of knockout - all correlate with dN
* Drummond, MBE, 2006 <cite> Drummond-MBE-2006 </cite>
** principal axis when do Principle Component Regression is: expression level, CAI, abundance - no other relevant axis
*** Principle Component Regression - take axes that find with Principle Component Analysis (PCA), and regress these with an outcome variable (here dN)
** the problem is protein interaction data is very unreliable <cite> vonMering-Nature-2002 </cite>
* Plotkin and Fraser, MBE, 2007, <cite> Plotkin-Fraser-MBE-2007 </cite>
** make all variables on equal footing by adding noise to them to equal the noise in the protein interaction data
*** find that the principle component found above drastically reduced
** hidden variable analysis to see if can extract anything from the noisy data
** contentious because protein interaction data is biased towards picking up interactions between highly abundant proteins, and thus slowly evolving proteins - conflation

== Side Note ==
* how does PCA deal with variables that have different scales?
** 2 options 
*** normalize all variables to have an internal variance of 1 (and 0-mean)
*** do PCA on the rank of the variables (non-parametric)
