==T9002==
*F2620 was ligated into 3K3(E/P) instead of E/X
*Re-ligated F2620 (M/X) into 3K3 (E/X) and 1AK3 (E/X)
**Reaction with 3K3 was left in incubator too long. Made another reaction, will transform both.
*Transformations went into warm room at 2:30

*Noticed that F2620 has an internal MfeI site. This could cause problems later on when re-ligating.
**Could not find alternative enzyme on NEB's site. (ApoI cuts R'AATT_Y, thus is an isoschizomer of EcoRI [G'AATT_C]. Since there is an EcoRI site on the reverse tail, we can't use this.)

==Misc==
*<s>Also Digesting more 3K3 (E/P)</s> Making o/n of 3K3
*Mini-prepped 1AK3, digested E/X, E/P

==I2056==
*Ligating into 1AK3; ran out of 3K3.

==I2055==
*Re-trying promoter PCR

==I2055 Synthesis==
* Making (hopefully silent) 1bp change to remove internal MfeI site. (CAATTG -> CAATCG [codon ATT->ATC (Ile)])

==ccdB==
*Started PCRs with E/X tails and S/X tails.

==Transformations/overnight stuff==
*O/n of 3K3
*Transformation of F2620-3K3 (2 samples), F2620-1AK3, and I2056-1AK3.
*Digesting 1AK3 E/X, E/P
