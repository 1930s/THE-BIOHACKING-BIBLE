Pipette Tip boxes can be recycled.  There should be a box under the bench currently occupied by Jason in 68-558D.  If there is not, put a large cardboard box there.  It is useful to save large cardboard boxes for this purpose.  Once the box is full, close it up and leave it under the gel cutting table in 68-564E.  Once you have a couple of full boxes, let the sales rep will come along and collect the boxes.
