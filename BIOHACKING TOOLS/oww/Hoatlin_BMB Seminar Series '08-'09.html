==Procedure for Inviting BMB Speakers==

*In May we will start sending out invitations for the Fall schedule. Please suggest names of a potential speaker you would like to invite, by emailing me, or better, adding the names and the link to contact information below your name. I will send out letters of invitation. Please indicate considerations for the timing of the visit (e.g., "I will be in China in September" or "please don't schedule for last two weeks of October" or "here are some potential dates that are good for me" ). This helps manage the scheduling tasks and reduces email burden. Our goal this year is to have 2 speakers a month on alternating Tuesdays.
 
*Some of you may like to send out your own invitation letters, feel free! Please cc Maureen with the invitation and status. 
*When the invited speaker responds to our invitation, I will write back to them, immediately post the acceptance on this wiki, and introduce the speaker to Lisa via email. Lisa will narrow down on some open dates, present the dates to the OHSU host, and settle on a mutually agreeable seminar date for the OHSU host and speaker. During this post-acceptance process Lisa will be in charge of the status.

==Post-Acceptance Organization==

*Once a date is OKed by speaker and host, a confirmed date will be posted by Jeni on the [http://www.ohsu.edu/biochem/seminars.cfm Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Web site].  
*After the date is confirmed, Jeni will contact the speaker and obtain the title/figure for the flyer, help with travel arrangements, book hotels, make dinner reservations and schedule and distribute itinerary. When the date is far in advance, Jeni will re-contact the speaker (and OHSU host) 3 months before the scheduled speaking date to finalize itinerary, travel, hotel, dinner plans.
*Please contribute to suggestions for the itinerary to avoid last-minute scramble and email avalanche. Each Speaker will have a section for those who would like to be included on the itinerary if possible. Please contribute directly to the wiki or email me or Lisa and we will post for you. Suggest people for your guest to see or put your name down to request a spot with someone else's speaker.

* The default arrangements are: accomodation at [http://www.heathmanhotel.com/ Heathman Hotel], dinner for four at [http://www.andinarestaurant.com/ Andina], catered lunch for 10 students/postdocs after the seminar. Please advise Jeni 2 weeks in advance if you prefer different arrangements for dinner.
