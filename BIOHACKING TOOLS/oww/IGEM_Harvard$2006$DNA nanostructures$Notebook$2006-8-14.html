==Goals for today==

===Microcon Purification Tweaking===
* repeat Friday's mega PEG ppt on 5.0 (?)
* Micron experiments with 0.1% and 0.01% SDS in buffer
** ...and use 1x folding buffer and not water for washes
** also: perform control expt with 10 bp+ ladder, since according to [http://www.millipore.com/publications.nsf/docs/6dkp6d Millipore documentation], the filter should retain ds DNAs longer than 100 bp

===Streptavidin-Bead "Protection" Assay on Inside- and Outside-Biotinylated c5.0===
*NB: no good purification of nanostructure from oligo has been achieved, but gel separation after elution should differentiate formerly bead-bound oligos from formerly bead-bound nanostructures

===Redux of [Mg++], [oligos]===
* Based on [[IGEM:Harvard/2006/DNA_nanostructures/Notebook/2006-8-7|the inconclusive gels from last Monday]], the titration will be redone with c5.0 at 8% PEG, 0.5M NaCl '''final'''.




==Mg2+, Oligo-Concentration Titration w/ c5.0==

===Goals===

* vary folding conditions ([{{mgcl2}}] and [oligo]) in order to determine best folding conditions for c5.0
* determine most efficient purification protocol (Microcon vs. PEG) based on recovery yields

===Protocol===

====1. Working Stock Concentration====

* concentrated 6 tubes of 96 {{ul}} c5.0D.L (no latches, outside-bound ligand) in Vacufuge so that [oligo]= 250nM * 6 = 1.5 {{uM}}

====2. Folding Rxns====

* used three different [[IGEM:Harvard/2006/Folding_buffers|folding buffers]] varying [{{mgcl2}}] 
* used two different [oligo concentrations]: 250 nM from the unconcentrated working stock, 1.5 {{uM}} from above
* folding conditions: 80{{c}} for 2 min., decrease 1{{c}} every 2 min. for 59 more times

Notes
* a,b - a and b of each are the same, just two different tubes.
* Oligos - 250 nM is 1x oligos, 1.5 {{um} is 6 oligos

==Microcon w/ detergent==

* add 20 {{ul}} given nanostructure to center of YM-50 Micrcon tube
* add 480 {{ul}} given folding buffer, microcentrifuge for 6 min. at 14k rcf, and repeat dilution and spinning 4 more times
* yielded approx. 100 {{ul}} retentate, which was concentrated to 15 to 60 {{ul}} in a Vacufuge (about 30 min. at 45 {{c}}), depending on the sample

* ran 2% agarose gel at 80 V for 1 h. Gel appears to be of such low qualitiy that the results are inconclusive (ladder isn't clear)
* ran another 2% agarose gel at 60V for 1 h.
* results/discussion
** unclear why 6hb filtration failed (oligos were retained) (lane 4)
** 0.1% SDS gives unusual/unknown smears (lanes 5 and 8)
*** under visible light, there are thin pink-red bands in the middle of these smears. is SDS breaking down the Microcon tube plastic?
** 0.01% SDS ''possibly'' gives higher yields than no SDS (lane 7 vs. lane 6), but it is not conclusively better yield, and it is still very poor overall yield (lane 7 vs. lane 3)



==Streptavidin Bead "Protection"==

*'''Goal:'''
** Determine whether c5.0 functions like a container - in other words, can it "protect" biotinylated   sites on the inside from being bound by streptavidin?  In order to do this, we can use [http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/TechBulletinFiles/techbulletinS1420.pdf| 1 micrometer-in-diameter magnetic streptavidin beads] (ie. bigger in diameter than the hole of the c5.0 barrel, so the streptavidin bound to the bead won't be able to access the internal biotin).  
**If we remove the material that is not streptavidin-bound initially (hopefully, internally-biotinylated barrels) and then elute the material which was streptavidin-bound (externally-biotinylated barrels, free-floating biotinylated oligos), a gel run with the elutes will show DNA material for the externally-biotinylated structures.

*'''Structural Justifications:'''
** NEB's magnetic streptavidin beads are 1um in diameter, too large to fit into the 30nm-wide barrel of the c5.0.
** However, conceivably you could imagine the streptavidin binding region being able to snake into the barrel, as streptavidin's dimensions are [http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/86/7/2190| 54 x 58 x 48 angstroms], or 5.4 x 5.8 x 4.8 nm, which would allow it to fit in the barrel.
*** Biotinylated sites within the barrel are attached to oligos which are 3 Ts from the scaffold-oligo binding point, thus making this a possibility, but hopefully not a frequent one.

*'''Issues:'''
** No protocol found for the Fluka agarose streptavidin beads, and the NEB magnetic bead protocol's heating requirements seem unsuitable for keeping nanoboxes folded throughout the process
***Nanoboxes must remain folded post-elution because they must be gel-distinguishable from eluted biotinylated oligos, which we have not been able to pre-purify out by other means.
  
**Elution methods are of two types:
**1. Overload with competitors - either streptavidin or biotinylated oligos
*** But can't: biotin-streptavidin bond is so strong that dissociation by competition would theoretically take years
**2. Denature the streptavidin using a) formamide, b) phenol, c) SDS + boiling
*** But can't: all the conditions require heat that might damage the nanostructures (65{{C}} and up)

*'''Solution:'''
** Degrade streptavidin with trypsin
*** Trypsin must be in solution ''w/o'' EDTA, which would otherwise chelate all the Mg2+ in the DNA nanobox solution that is necessary to keeping it folded.

*'''Protocol:'''
<pre>
1. Incubate:
     5uL beads (binding capacity: 2pmol/1uL, thus, 10pmol - far greater than the available binding sites in the DNA nanobox solutions)
     35uL 1x folding buffer
     10uL test solution

           TEST SOLUTIONS:
           --------------
           a) H2O (ie. test = no biotin in solution)
           b) biotinylated oligos (c5.0.8(b)) - 250uM per oligo in pre-working stock = 1mM biotinylation - for 1.6pmol = 1.6uL - thus, 1.6uL + 8.4uL H2O must be added for test solution
           c) c5.0 E(b) (outside biotinylation) (was Microcon "purified" Tu 8.9) - ~2000fmol of binding sites/12.5uL, or 0.16pmol/ul - thus, 1.6pmol 
           d) c5.0 F(b) (inside biotinylation) (was Microcon "purified" Tu 8.9) - "

2. Mix
3. Pellet by drawing magnet down to bottom of tube (7 minutes using the old magnet)
4. Discard supernatant
5. Add 50uL 1x folding buffer

6. Repeat steps 2-5 three more times.

7. Trypsinize by adding to pellet:
      3uL trypsin (1mg/mL)
      27uL 1x folding buffer
8. Incubate 4hr-overnight @ 37 degrees C

9. Pellet by drawing magnet down to bottom of tube and remove supernatant to clean tube (1 minute, using the Magnetorack).
10. Run 20uL of each supernatant on 2% agarose gel (10mM MgCl2) for 1hr at 80V.
