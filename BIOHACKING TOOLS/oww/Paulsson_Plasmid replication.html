==Working with radioactivity in the Kirschner lab==
do online safety test<br>
talk to Mike Gage about getting on their permit<br>
series code SKM<Br>
can order radionuclides through Harvard site using Kirschner Lab as the destination and permit holder, bubt James bills our grant (how was this made clear in purchasing process?)

==Measuring DNA synthesis with radiolabeled thymidine==

Before you begin:

1.  Use a ''thy-'' strain (not ''thi-'', that's thiamine not thymine), 

or add 250 ug/ml deoxyadenosine to growth media to label strains that aren't thymine auxotrophs (BBA, 61:618, 1962)


2.  [14C]-thymidine labeling before treatment (changing temp., adding drug, etc...) provides internal control for each sample pulse-labeled with [3H]-thymidine at time of treatment

3.  CsCl equilibrium gradient will separate DNA base on GC content;  addition of ethidium bromide will preferentially displace CsCl from change density of plasmid DNA - EtBr binding: linear and open circle (OC) > covalently closed circle (CCC)

4.  sucrose velocity gradients can also be used, these will also separate open and closed plasmid DNA

5.  The difference between thymine and thymidine: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymine in case you forgot!], but what's the difference for labeling protocol?  Perhaps thymidine is incorporated a little faster (doesn't require addition of deoxyribose), and is better for pulse studies like we want to do




==New style==

===Labeling DNA===
1. Grow bugs in 10ml minimal medium, containing 250 ug/ml 2-deoxyadenosine, to a cell density of about 5x10E7/ml.<br>
Optional: containing [methyl-14C]-thymidine (about 0.2 uCi/ml,; specific activity 50 mCi/mmol)
     
OR label for approx. 90' at 30 deg with [methyl-14C]-thymidine at 4 uCi/ml) (Hishimoto-Gotoh)<Br>
OR label for 6h at 25 deg with with [methyl-14C]-thymidine at 1 uCi/ml) (Eichenlaub)

2. Wash with fresh medium and resuspend in ###ml media.

3. Grow for 5 min to recover from washes, and adjust to modified growth conditions.

4. Add [methyl-3H]-thymidine (10 uCi/ml; specific activity about 20 Ci/mmol), grow for 30min.

5. Add excess cold thymine (100 ug/ml; or saturating?) and NaN3 to 50mM; place on ice.

===Plasmid prep===

===Chromosomal DNA prep===


==Old style==
===Lysis (& removal of most, but not all, chromosomal DNA?)===

===Cesium chloride equilibrium gradient of dye-bound DNA===

==Scintillation counting==

Need to wash filters to remove unincorporated label???
How to distinguish between counts from 14C and 3H: energy of beta-particle released is different and can be distinguished by the rate of scintillation events.  Counters have multiple channels to do just this.
