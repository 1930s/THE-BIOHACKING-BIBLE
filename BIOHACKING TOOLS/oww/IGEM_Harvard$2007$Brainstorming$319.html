Biological Based Fuel Cells

Bacterial that Respond to (by fluorescence) or Degrade Plaque

Viruses as a Transfer Mechanism

Engineering ''E. coli'' to Resist Mutations
<br>     --The intention is prevention of evolution that would ruin biological parts; however, we recognize that directed evolution is a useful tool in 'discovering' potentially useful parts and mutations.

Cellulose to EtOH in Algae or other system

""~~Some Papers on this Subject (added by SAV, feel free to add more)11:22, 2 April 2007 (EDT)""
<br>

Lynd, Zyl, et al. "Consolidated bioprocessing of cellulosic biomass: an update" Current Opinion in Biotechnology 2005, 16:577-583
<br>
---This paper gives a pretty good overview of research into consolidated bioprocessing of cellulose into ethanol, and some of the main problems as well. If we're interested in looking at fuels, this is definitely a good paper to look at.
<br>

Jeffries, Thomas. "Engineering yeasts for xylose metabolism" Current opinion in biotechnology 2006, 17:320-326.
<br>
---This paper looks at turning xylose into ethanol via yeasts, and recent results in this field of research. If we think we might not want to use bacteria, this is a good overview.
<br>
Sticklen, Mariam. "Plant genetic engineering to improve biomass characteristics for biofuels." Current Opinion in Biotechnology 2006, 17:315-319
<br>
--Looks at problems from biomass cellulose, such as lignin, and current research into ways to treat it. Also looks at other ways to engineer plants. I think less relevant for us, but still interesting as a way for getting a feel of some of the issues surrounding biomass cellulose
