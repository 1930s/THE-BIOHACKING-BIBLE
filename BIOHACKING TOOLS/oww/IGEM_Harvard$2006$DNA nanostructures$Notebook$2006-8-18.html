==Streptavidin Magnetic Beads, Take 3-4==

* Trypsinized the beads, in 50uL solution that were retained from yesterday, for four hours @ 37{{C}}.
* Ran gel of them, ladder, and p7308
** Noticed when took the gel out for imaging that the buffer was below the gel slightly - didn't cover top
** Imaging: NO BANDS AT ALL, not for the ladder or even p7308.
*** Suspect that the gel didn't run due to too-low-buffer.

* On the off-chance that the trypsin digest didn't work, used 2uL (of unknown activity concentration, see above) of proteinase K to try again to digest the streptavidin.
**Incubated overnight at 37{{C}}.

* Mixed c5.0.1 and other pre-working stocks and working stocks listed above.

* Folded 4 rxns each, at intermediate {Mgcl2}} of 20mM final concentration, of:
** E(b)
** F(b)
** A lidless

===12 Hours Later===
* Ran gel of proteinase-K-ed final supernatant

**'''Results:'''
***NOTHING in final-supernatant lanes again, indicating either:
****(A) Second trypsinization (not able to be visualized because ran the gel without enough buffer) worked, leaving nothing on the streptavidin for the proteinase K to have digested.
****(B) Proteinase K did not digest the streptavidin to elute.  
*** Wash lanes were also dim - did not Speedvac for long enough.
**** Also, gel was older and had been left out of fridge overnight.
*****'''Plan:''' Try again with proteinase K as eluent, as there were so many problems with this trial (ie. "Eb" and "Fb", trypsinization first two times around)

== Folding design 6 == 

* Mixing pre-working stocks (c6.0.1, c6.0.2, c6.0.3, c6.0.4, c6.0.5)
** To mix pre-working stocks from plates, pipet 10 {{ul}} of each of the appropriate oligos into 1.5 mL tubes. 
** List of pre-working and working stock oligos: [[Table_of_c6.0_Working_Stocks]]

(don't have time to complete. will do on sunday).
