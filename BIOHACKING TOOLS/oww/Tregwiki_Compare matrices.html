** [http://treg.molgen.mpg.de/cgi-bin/pfm_meme_form.pl TREG Comparator] is a rather unique site. It accepts a weight matrix as an input and will return those motifs from Transfac that are similar to this matrix. Very nice, if you got a motif from anyone and want to check if its similar to something else (many factors recognize very similar motifs which might be intentional as they can block each other)
** [http://rulai.cshl.edu/cgi-bin/MatCompare/home.cgi?process=compareMatricesForm MatCompare] is the same thing with different statistics (downloadable as c++ source as part of the CREAD library)
** [http://atlas.med.harvard.edu/download/extra.html CompareACE] from the alignace package will compare matrices and find the most similar one
