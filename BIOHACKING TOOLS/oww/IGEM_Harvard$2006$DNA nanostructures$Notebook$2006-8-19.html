==Streptavidin Beads: Agarose and Magnetic Retrial==

===Early Morning===
* Simultaneously ran protocol using:
**(A) magnetic beads - using same protocol again, to retry proteinase K digest for elution
**(B) agarose beads:
<pre>
binding capacity: 15-20ug of biotin/mL of agarose bead solution
  biotin's molecular weight: 244.31g/mol
  thus, binding capacity = (15e-6 to 30e-6)/244.31 = 61 to 122 nmoles/mL of bead solution, or 61 pmoles/uL

1680 pmoles of binding sites on a 40-uL rxn's worth of boxes + 36 pmoles of binding sites on a rxn-including-biotinylated-oligos' free oligos = 1716pmoles of binding sites

1716pmoles binding sites/(61pmoles/uL of beads) = 27.8uL of beads needed, round to 28uL
</pre>

* '''Incubations'''
**Agarose Beads:
***28uL bead solution
***40uL rxn
***32uL 1x folding buffer
***TOTAL: 100uL

**Magnetic Beads:
***200uL bead solution
***40uL rxn
***60uL 1x folding buffer
***TOTAL: 300uL

* '''Wash Protocols'''
**Pellet:
***Agarose Beads:
****Spin down for 1min @ 14,000rpm
***Magnetic Beads:
****Use MagnaRack
**Pipette out wash-supernatant into tube; repeat this each wash.
**Add 100uL of 1x folding buffer (30mM MgCl2, just noticed)
**Repeat 3 times

* '''Elution Protocols'''
**Reconstitute beads in 98uL 1x folding buffer
**Add 2uL of proteinase K (indeterminate concentration; 5mg lyophilized Qiagen's discontinued proteinase K was rehydrated in 260uL of dH2O, as per instructions on label)
**Incubate overnight @ 37{{C}}

===Late Afternoon===

* '''Manipulation of Elute and Washes'''
**Agarose Beads:
***Beads were spun down for 2min @ 14,000rpm.
***100uL of elute was removed to a clean tube and Speedvaced for ~1hr total (Speedvac was stopped and sample was examined after 30min, 20min, and 7 min to ensure that there was no over-Speedvacing)
***Washes were Speedvaced for ~2hrs.
**Magnetic Beads:
***Beads were pelleted with MagnaRack
***100uL of elute was removed to a clean tube and Speedvaced for ~1hr total (Speedvac was stopped and sample was examined after 30min, 20min, and 7 min to ensure that there was no over-Speedvacing)
***Washes were Speedvaced for ~2hrs.
