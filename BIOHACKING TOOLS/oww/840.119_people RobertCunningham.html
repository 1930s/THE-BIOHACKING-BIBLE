My name is Robby Cunningham, and I am a senior with a B.S. major in both chemistry and biology. I am looking for this class to help inform me about biological technologies that might help me in chemistry. I would like to discuss/learn about any biological technology that could have use in chemistry. For personal info, I am from Waverly Iowa and I have been in martial arts for 13 years and teach at two clubs.
