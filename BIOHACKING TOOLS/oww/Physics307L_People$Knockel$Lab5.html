== Speed of Light Summary ==

I have calculated that the speed of light is

<math>c=3.16(13)\times10^{8}</math> m/s.

The actual value of <math>c</math>=3.00x10<sup>8</sup> m/s is slightly outside of the error interval I have provided, but there is no reason why error intervals should include the actual value even if no significant systematic error exists because the actual value is barely outside this interval.

My major source of random error was a "time walk" which is when the strength of a signal affects the measured time it takes for that signal to be sent.

As for HOW I measured this exciting and fundamental constant of nature, check out my notebook!
