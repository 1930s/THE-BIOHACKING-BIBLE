==To Do==
*Run gel of T9002 and E0240 PCR
*PCR Cleanup of T & E
*Digest T & E with Mfe1 and Nsi1
*PCR cleanup B, J, and R
*Ligate and transform B, J, R
*Log outline, schedule, and parts

==Digest Cont'd==
*heat shocked digests for J04650, B0032, R0040, and the plasmids
*put in 4 degree 

==Gel==
[[Image:07.06.22.jpg|thumb|left|Gel from 6/22/07]]

*Ran an analytic gel of the PCR product of T9002 and E0240
* L to R: Ladder, E, T, Ladder, space, Ladder
* E0240 gave no results and the T9002 fragments are 1kb when the desired product should have been 2kb
* T9002 has to B0015 sites in it and we conclude it must have cut only at the first site
* This also explains the absence of E0240 b/c they have the same end sequences
* Ordered new reverse, E0240F, and T9002F primers

==Designing Primers==

*New Reverse Primer (both T9002 and E0240) '''TCAGCCAT ''ATGCAT''''' AAAACGAAAGGCCCAGTCTTTCGACTGAGCCTTTCGTTTTATTTGATGCCTGGCTCTAGTATTATTATTTG
**Melting temp without tail is 81.5
**Is so long because it must go all the way back to some of the GFP

New forward E0240 '''CTTAGTAG ''CAATTG''''' TCACACAGGAAAGTACTAGATGCGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTTTTCACTGGAGTTGTCCCAATTCTTGTTGAATTAG
**Melting temp without tail is 80.9
**Length is to have similar melting temp as reverse

New forward T9002 '''CTTAGTAG ''CAATTG''''' TCCCTATCAGTGATAGAGATTGACATCCCTATCAGTGATAGAGATACTGAGCACTACTAGAGAAAGAGGAGAAATACTAGATG
**Melting temp 80.0

Bold is the tail, italics is the restriction site.

==PCR Purification==
Did a PCR cleanup of the 3 backbones, T9002, E0240, B0032, R0040, and J04650
* Used 50ul of B, R, and J
*Used 90ul of T & E
*Protocol is in QIAquick spin handbook

==3-way Ligation==
Nishant Ligated:
*R0040, J04650, and 1AT3
*R, J, and 1AC3
*B0032, J04650, and 1AT3
*B, J, 1AC3

==Overnights==
*Checked competent cells by transforming with pUC18 and plating on both plain LB and Amp
* Set up 2 5ml overnight cultures of each plasmid (1AT3, 1AC3, 1AK3, and 3K3)
** 1 to miniprep and 1 to make glycerol stocks
