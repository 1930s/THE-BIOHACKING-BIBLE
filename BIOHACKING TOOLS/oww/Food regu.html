== '''Regular Fly Food''' ==

Regular fly food is prepared in bulk amounts.  It is cooked up in a large pot that makes approximately 13L-14L of food, that can be poured into 1000-1200 vials.

*add 12.75L of warm tap water(takes less time to bring up to temp) to a large pot with a capacity around 20Ls.
** Place on heating device, place lid on the pot, and bring to a boil
*When boiling is achieved, add a stir bar, and begin stirring.
*Add the following ingredients in specified order, while stirring with a long spoon(in the same rotation as the bar) to help facilitate the even mixing of ingredients and prevent clumping.
**113.7g Agar
**1586g Sucrose - give Agar and sucrose a few minutes to disolve into water before adding additional ingredients, but be diligent not to allow a boil over.
**480g Brewers Yeast - should suspend into solution rather easily as long as you add it gradualy
**560g Cornmeal - Same percautions as the Yeast
*allow this to cook up for about 5-10 minutes, as the cornmeal absorbs water and thickens the food.
*Remove from hotplate, and remove stir-bar
*Place pot in an autoclavable tray with about 1 inch of hot water in the bottom.
*Autoclave this on a Liquid cycle for 20 minutes(It should take about 50 minutes in all with build up and releasing of pressure).
*Empty water from tray and place it(with pot) on floor, on top of mixing stand.
*Remove lid from pot
*attach stirring paddel to mixer, and lower into food so that the stirrer comes about half an inch off the bottom.
*set the speed at about medium, and use a fan to cool faster depending on your patients.
*Once the temperature of the mixture reaches 65C, add tegosept
**150ml [[tegosept_sol | tegosept solution]]
