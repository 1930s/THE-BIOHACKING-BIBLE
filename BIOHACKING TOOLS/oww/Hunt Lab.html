'''BioSystems Group @ Hunt Lab'''

Research in the Biosystems group can be broadly characterized as a blend of Bioengineering, Computational Biology (including Bioinformatics and Computational Therapeutics), Systems Biology, and Therapeutic Engineering.  It is uniquely interdisciplinary.  Our goal is to use and create computational and informatic approaches to discover useful new biological knowledge. We seek novel approaches that will accelerate drug development and enable therapeutic advances, optimization, and individualization.
