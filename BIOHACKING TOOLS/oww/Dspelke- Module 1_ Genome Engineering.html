|-
| I 
| Assembly
| Modifiy the gene so that the channels becomes less selective and thus allow other ions, molecules, and proteins to enter and exit the bacteria- see how this affects the life cycles of both the bacteria and the phage
|-
| II 
| Replication of DNA + strand
| Alter the gene to make it more active and thus replicate DNA more frequently- see how increased DNA production affects phage growth 
|-
| III 
| Phage tail protein (5 copies)
| Modify the proteins that bind to the bacteria (and thus initiate the F pilus and infection) so that the bacteriophage canbind to and infect other types of bacteria- examine the varied life cycles that result
|-
| IV 
| Assembly
| Alter the gene in such a way as to destabalize the outer membrane (e.g. no longer detergent-resistant)- test varying environments for phage survival rate 
|-
| V 
| Binds ssDNA
| Vary the activity of the gene and thus the competition between dsDNA formation and the sequestering of ssDNA- compare the results to find the optimum level of phage production possible
|-
| VI 
| Phage tail protein (5 copies)
| Add some sort of tag to the gene that is only visible when p6 is outside of the bacteria- thus we would be able to determine when the phage has been secreted
|-
| VII 
| Phage head protein (5 copies)
| Alter the gene so that p8 cannot be substituted for p5- see how this affects the phage (e.g. can it still be secreted?)
|-
| VIII 
| Phage coat protein (2700 copies) 
| Add a small protein to the gene that we would like to amplify becuase p8 is synthesized so many times- see if this method works and if yes, what applications could this be used for?
|-
| IX 
| Phage head protein (5 copies)
| Modify the gene so that it can bind to bacterial surface proteins (like p3 does)- see if this allows the phage to interact with other bacteria (now that both ends can bind)
|-
| X 
| DNA replication
| Altering this gene will also alter gene 2 so any alteration would affect both genes, so make any number of small modifications - see what interesting phenomena result
|-
| XI 
| Assembly
| Modify the gene so that it is longer, hopefully resulting in a larger channel- see if this could allow multiple phages to pass through, thus making the channels more effective
