=Update=

IlvE- strain came from Yale (the strain that will overproduce leucine when tyrB is overexpressed).  Also, the leucine-overproducing plasmid that when transformed overproduces leucine in cells grown on media supplemented with ammonium formate.

=To Do Today=

1. Run time courses for J45120 and J45181 (n:53 (J45120) and n+1:13 (J45181) for n=12 through n=8 for addition of SA, for n=1 through n=9 for GC extraction) 

2. Add known methyl salicylate to random cells and GC extract- DONE

3. Run the methyl salicylate samples on the GC for recalibration- DONE

4. Contact Li Li about good time to meet about recalibration- DONE

5. Smell cultures grown on Tom media- growing up very, very slowly or probably not at all- contact Tom- DONE

6. GC extract samples grown on Tom media- wait until they grow up more tomorrow

7. Take out AB3257, make a glycerol stock of it- DONE

8. Bleach bottles from last night- DONE

9. Write thank you notes to Yale Center and Dr. Esaki- DONE

10. Plate the IlvE- strain- DONE

11. Make LCs of J45181 and J45120 for next week- DONE
