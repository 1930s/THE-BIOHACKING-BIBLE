I am an Experimental Officer at the Centre for Integrated Genomic Medical Research (CIGMR).  I graduated with a BSc (Hons) in Biochemistry from the University College of North Wales, Bangor in 1994, and in 1998 completed an MPhil in Molecular Biology at the University of Nottingham.  
I spent two years at the internationally renowned Arthritis Research Campaignâ€™s Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology which is a division of Imperial College, London, where I spent time researching the genetic causes of rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.
Initially my research at CIGMR was focused on investigating the genetic basis of common complex disorders.  I have been heavily involved in the study of adult onset idiopathic myopathies with one of the largest myositis collections in the world. 
More recently I have developed an interest in gene expression and I am now the Laboratory Manager for CIGMRs Transcriptomics facility based in the new Manchester Interdisciplinary Biocentre.  As well as running a gene expression service I am interested in improving and developing new methods for assaying genes employing reference gene screening and quality control. 
As Laboratory Manager I facilitate the smooth running of the Transcriptomics Laboratories by managing the day to day running, administration and also working as a supervisor and mentor to a number of MSc and PhD students within the research group of Prof Philip Day.
CIGMR has over 35 full time research scientists in the Unit which houses both the MRC UK DNA archive and the ARC National Repository for rheumatic disease material. CIGMR offers a comprehensive facility for the analysis of complex diseases by combining epidemiological, statistical and genetic approaches with contemporary genomic screens. CIGMR is a key member of the Consortium for Post-Genomic Science.
