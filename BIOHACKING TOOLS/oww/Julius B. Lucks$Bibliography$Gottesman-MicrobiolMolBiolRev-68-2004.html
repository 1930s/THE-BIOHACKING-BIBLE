* review of history of discovery of lambda - what it was used for in the field
* establishment of repression and prophage insertion are distinct steps in establlishment of lysogeny

== Prophage Insertion ==

* Cambell mechanism - 1968 review (28) - Fig 1
** also (24,31)
** Hershey - cohesive ends making ring (91) - also (207)
*** DNA ligase helps ring closure - Gellert (68)
** phage-encoded site-specific recombinase (178,179)
*** see also (87,138) for attP-attB recombination rules - site-specificity gives high efficiency and does not require extensive homology
* (118) - 15 bp region where recombination occurs - see also 200
* Guerrini (87) - prophage excision not simple chemical reversal of prophage insertion
** lambbda mutants unable to excise (84)
*** (49) - diff conditions for favoring integration over excision and vice versa
*** integrase more stable than Xis (201)
** Xis produced from P_L, Int produced from P_Int
*** P_Int activated by CII - CII coordinates Int synthesis and repressor synthesis (35)
** after induction, both Int and Xis produced from P_L 
*** (49,83) - Guarneros and Court - how Int produced from both P_L and P_Int - Fig 2
**** sib - sit of endonucleolytic RNase cleavage - promoter distal to int
**** N - suppresses termination of certain phage transcripts
* P_L transcripts contain sib because termination suppressed by N - therefore cleaved and destabilizes int message
** P_L transcript made after induction does not contain sib b.c. of gene permutation after inserts (Fig 1)
* P_Int transcripts terminate before sib and are more stable (173,174)
** start site is within xis
** terminate at T_Int, and do not contain complete sib
* excision requires Int and Xis
** in vitro integration/excision - (77,148,149)
* Int a type I topoisomerase (115)
* IHF (host integration factor) required for integration (150,151)
** 2 subunits - ihfA (hid/himA), and ihfB (hip/himD) (114,136,204)
** architectural role - bends DNA to form Int-attP-IHF intasome (73)
* effective integration requires negative supercoils (69,139)
