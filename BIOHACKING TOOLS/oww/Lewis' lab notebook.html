*5 minipreps ([[R0010]], [[E0241]], [[E7104]]) [[Miniprep/Qiagen_kit|Protocol used]]
*R0010 and E0241 digests; digests were done according to [[Knight:Restriction_Digest]]; recipe halved.
*Phosphatase was added to R0010 samples; protocol [[Phosphatase_treatment_of_linearized_vector|here]].
*Gel run to separate out DNA fragments resulting from R0010 and E0241 digests. 130V, 45 min.
*Bands were almost invisible (wells used were those to the right of the second ladder). This may have been due to a second wash step during the mini-preps (although this is unlikely).

*Carried out ligation reaction with Matt/Tiff's DNA. Protocol according to [[Silver:_Ligation|Silver Ligation]] but with 5 minute incubation.
*Transformed TOP10 cells. [[TOP10_chemically_competent_cells|(Preparing TOP10 cells)]] [[Transforming_chemically_competent_cells|(Transformation)]]

==6/19==
*Selected colonies containing R0010+E0241 fragments, which appeared to be constitutively on. For more details, ask Nick.
*Cultured two colonies in 5mL LB + 50uL Amp (5mg/uL orig) overnight @37 on shaker. 

==6/20==
*Made a glycerol stock of two colonies.
*Minipreps carried out. [[Miniprep/Qiagen_kit|This protocol]] was used except final elution in 30 uL water to increase DNA concentrations. 
*Digests were done according to [[Knight:Restriction_Digest]]; recipe halved. REs = XbaI, PstI.
*1.2% E-gel run using 10 uL digest + 10 uL water per well. See lanes 5 and 6 in image below.
