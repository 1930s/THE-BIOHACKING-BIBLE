I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Manchester where I obtained a BSc (2004) and MB ChB (2005). I completed several research projects whilst a medical student. I presented at the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery’s Annual meeting and also published this work. Currently, I am working as a medical doctor in Hope Hospital, Manchester. I have been continuing involvement in research and was successfully awarded the EPSRC doctoral training centre scholarship which will be commencing in September 2007. At this time, I will commence my PhD concerned with keloid disease.

I am a plastic surgical trainee having obtained my MBBS and MRCS. I am currently Aesthetic Research Fellow at The healing foundation. I studied medicine in Sind Medical College and Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) in Karachi, Pakistan. I then proceeded to complete my medical internship in AlKhobar, Saudi Arabia at the King Fahad University Hospital. Following that I was a resident in General and Plastic Surgery at the tertiary referral centre of the eastern province of Saudi Arabia; Dammam Central Hospital. In my pursuit of a career in Plastic Surgery, I came to the UK in 2001 where I completed my Basic Surgical Training (BST) in the Northwest of England and worked at the departments of Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery at Booth Hall Children’s Hospital, Wythenshawe Hospital of the University in Manchester; and the Southwest of England at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol. I am currently doing a PhD under the supervision of Dr Bayat. My project is aimed at identifying susceptibility genes to Keloid scarring. In October 2006, I was awarded the Aesthetic Research Fellowship by the Healing Foundation at the Royal College of Surgeons of England. The fellowship has enabled me to pursue fulfil my ambition in doing a higher degree and in this important and worthwhile subject area.
This is an international study looking at keloid families in Africa where keloid disease is endemic. Pedigrees will be established with a view to determine the heritability of keloid disease. Genetic samples from these patients will be analysed in Manchester at the Centre for Integrated Genomic Medical Research (CIGMR) and the Manchester Interdisciplinary Biocentre.

I finished my BSc in Immunology at King’s Collage London and started my MSc in Immunogenetics in Manchester. As part of my MSc, I was supervised by Dr Bayat and Dr Day for period of five months and I have been lucky to continue this for my PhD. My research in keloid scars involves gene expression, and cell cycle regulation.
