====Location on Campus====
Our lab is located in MRB 518. Go past the fountain and into Mac Hall, noting ducks if present. Follow the main hall around counter-clockwise until you get to the sketchy elevaters and ride them up to the 5th floor. Yell when you get here so we can come dig you out of the rubble (you'll understand when you see it).

====Parking====
If you're a visitor, Good Luck! No, seriously, you can park in Patient and Visitor Parking, indicated by a yellow circle with a "P" in it.  The closest lot is across from the ER. Two hour street-side parking is also available in various locations. If you're an employee, you'll have to sell a piece of your soul for a parking permit on the hill. Other methods to try are breaking a limb and bringing a doctor's note (The Alexis Strategy), and pretending to live with someone on the hill (The Stacie Strategy). If you know ahead of time you will be visiting we can arrange, for a price, a temporary parking permit. Or if you are Eric Brown (Maureen's son), you just park in a "primo spot you found, right out front" (ie, the President's spot). We're not bitter about parking or anything.

====Public Transportation====
Bus #8 comes up the hill from downtown all day long. Express busses 61, 64, 65, 66, 68 run during peak hours. Certain Townies make for very interesting bus rides.
