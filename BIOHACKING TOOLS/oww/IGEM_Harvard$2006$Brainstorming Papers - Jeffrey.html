'''A synthetic multicellular system for programmed pattern formation.'''
*Basu ''et al.'' created a gene circuit with a non-monotonic response to AHL concentration.
*Main idea: use two concentration boundaries to define three regions with different transcriptional activity
**GFP is repressed at low and high concentrations of AHL, and expressed at medium concentrations
**Basu ''et al.'' created three variants with different upper boundaries
***Concentration varies with distance; thus, a mixture of different variants of bacteria produces a bullseye pattern when exposed to a point source of AHL
***Multiple AHL sources produce pretty pictures
*We could reuse the basic idea behind their circuit if we need to define a multiple-region response to some stimulus

'''Spatiotemporal control of gene expression with pulse-generating networks'''
*Basu ''et al.'' created a gene circuit that exhibits transient expression of GFP in response to AHL ("pulse generator"). 
*The amplitude and duration of this "pulse" can be artificially adjusted, and depend on the rate of increase of AHL concentration as well as the absolute concentration.
**Cells can be made to respond to nearby cells and ignore far-away cells
***Reporter expression varies with distance, even though AHL concentrations eventually reach the same level everywhere
*Further tweaking:
**Produce AHL as well as expressing GFP, to propagate the AHL signal
**Connect the output of the pulse generator to a bistable switch
