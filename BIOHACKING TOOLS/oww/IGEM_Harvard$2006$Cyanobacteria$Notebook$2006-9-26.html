==To do==
*50mL cultures of:
**Lac+RBS+KaiA (Nick's A09): AMP Resistance
**Lac+RBS+KaiB (Nick's B11): KAN Resistance
**Lac+RBS+KaiC (Peng's M2-7): KAN Resistance
**B0034 (from frozen): AMP Resistance
*Send B11 and A09 for sequencing
*Glycerol stock B11 and A09
*Save some of M2-7 for growth testing
*Midiprep the above

==Determination of what needs yet to be created==

*We need to make to complete stage 1:
**RBS + KaiB
**RBS + KaiC
**KaiA (biobricks registry)
**KaiB (biobricks registry)
**KaiC (biobricks registry)

*We need [semilarge] concentrated amounts of:
**Lac+RBS+KaiA (created by Nick)
**Lac+RBS+KaiB (created by Nick)
**Lac+RBS+KaiC (created by Peng, verified)
**B0034 (which contains just RBS)
**KaiA
***Have a lot of
**KaiB
***Have a lot of
**KaiC
***Have a lot of
**J04500 (for the biobricks registry pieces)
***Have a lot of
