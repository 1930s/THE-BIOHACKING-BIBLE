Transcription used to make RNAs for splicing.  This method produces more RNA that is not as hot as Method 1.  This has usefulness at certain times.  The capping ratio is higher to make sure the RNA gets capped.<br>
The M7cap is a GTP capping nucleotide that helps prevent degregation of the RNA during splicing.  Some papers have cited using an unmethylated cap, I found it works just as well as a methylated cap.  I have also tried not capping the RNA and I have noticed capped being better than uncapped.  The CTP is from Perkin-Elmer/NEN.  The NTP's need to be pHed to 8, and the reaction needs to be a final pH8.1 at 37°C (pH changes with temperature changes).  pH and T7 buffer are most often the reason why this reaction fails (other than template problems).  The spermidine in the buffer does not last a long time and as it breaks down your amt of product decreases.  Milligan and Uhlenbeck, 1989, Methods in Enzymology: 180 51-62 is an excellent source to be read by the serious transcriber.<br>
