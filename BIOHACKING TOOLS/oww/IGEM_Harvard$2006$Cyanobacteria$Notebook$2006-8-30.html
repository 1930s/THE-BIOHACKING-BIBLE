==Ligation Protocol I used==
Go to our Protocols section, extensive writeup.


==Ligation #6 Plates==

Thousands of colonies! Excuse the blurriness, used my cameraphone :(

'''Note that for 2uL we got a lot more colonies than for 19uL. Means that the ligation mixture is toxic to the cells; do not use 19uL anymore for chemically competent cells!'''

==Finally==

Did a colony PCR of 36 colonies + positive control, streaking each on part of a KAN plate. 8uL PCR supermix, 1uL VF2 (2nM), 1uL VR (2nM).


It looks like we've finally succeeded in ligating J04500\SP + KaiC\XP!

Succesful ligations: V2 #4, V19 #1, #4, #5, #6, #7, M2 #7, M19 #2, #4, #8

==Sequencing results for KaiB==
... Don't make sense. Doing some AlignX work, shows that KaiB WITH biobricks prefix and suffix is in front of the J04500 promoter+RBS. Ideas?
