[http://www.btxonline.com/ BTX] TransPorator Plus

*No longer sold by BTX.
*For a replacement chamber, the 630B safety stand is compatible with the transporator plus. The 630B  (cat# 450207) list price is $556.00, we also distribute through VWR and Fisher.
*The tip of the sliding chamber broke off.  However, if it is left inside all the way at the end of safety chamber, the cuvette can still be positioned properly between the electrodes leading to a successful electroporation.  Ask Reshma for more information.
