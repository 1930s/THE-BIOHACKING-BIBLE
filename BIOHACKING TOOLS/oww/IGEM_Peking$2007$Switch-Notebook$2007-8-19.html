experimenter: WMC, CDZ
==precipitation of RD3, RD2, RS2, CD1==
but the electrophoresis shows no visible signs, which means failure

==ligation==
with GFP-plx007, all use the proportion 4:1

==miniprep of SS3, RS3ï¼Œall together 30==

==re-digestion of RD3, RD2, RS3, CD1==
template: 20uL
XhoI 2uL
SpeI 2uL
H beffer 10uL
ddH2O  66uL
for a shortage of template, we just use 10-15uL template in each solution

==Sequencing results come back, the results are good!==
