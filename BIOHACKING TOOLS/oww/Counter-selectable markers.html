#lacY (t-o-nitrophenyl-B-D-galactopyranoside)
#thyA (trimethoprim)
#pheS (p-chlorophenylalanine) see PMID 8125286
#*Relaxed substrate specificity mutant of phenylalanine tRNA transferase that will incorporate p-chlorophenylalanine into proteins, killing the cell
#?(phage)
#*probably >1 gene can confer resistance?
#*previous work (Novick/Szilard) has mapped mutation rates confering T1 resistance in chemostats.
#pyrF (5FoA)
#*Jeff has ordered synthesized/BB'd
#*in pyrF- strains can be selected on medium w/o Uracil, so can be selected and coutner-selected.
