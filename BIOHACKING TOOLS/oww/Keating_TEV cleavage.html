== Protocol for TEV cleavage ==

*written by [[user:ziz|Nora]]

cleaves proteins at specific sequence E-X-X-Y-X-Q-G/S between Q and G/S, with best sequence ENLYFQG

'''buffer'''
*50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0
*0.5 mM EDTA
*1 mM DTT
*can tolerate up to 100 mM NaCl

'''cleavage conditions'''
*optimize according to sample, but here are starting conditions that have worked
*dialyze/resuspend/elute protein sample from 1L culture in 10-25ml TEV buffer
*add 0.5-1 mg TEV
*incubate for 1-3 hr at RT or 3 hr â€“ overnight at 4C
