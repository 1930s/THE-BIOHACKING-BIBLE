Transformation of ''Mesoplasma florum'' by electroporation

Materials

* overnight culture of ''Mesoplasma florum'' in ATCC 1161 medium
** preparing 10 ml cultures with 1, 10, 100, and 1000 &mu;l of infected cultures assures that one of these will be ready the next day at the correct OD level.  Select cultures which are just changing color.
* chilled mycoplasma electroporation buffer
** 8 mM HEPES pH 7.4
** 272 mM sucrose
* chilled 2 mm electroporation cuvettes
* chilled ATCC 1161 medium aliquots of 1 ml in 2 ml eppendorfs
* Selective medium or plates
** Tetracycline resistance from TetM is higher than 200 &mu;g/ml
** Untransformed cells grow poorly at 4 &mu;g/ml
** Selective plates are at 15 &mu;g/ml


Protocol

* chill the centrifuge to 4&deg;
* spin down 10 ml of overnight culture at 8000g for 5 minutes, remove the supernatent
* resuspend the pellet in the remaining liquid by vigorous vortexing
* add 10 ml of chilled electroporation buffer and mix
* spin down again, remove supernatent
* resuspend the pellet in the remaining liquid
* add 10 ml of chilled electroporation buffer
* spin down again, remove supernatent
* resuspend the pellet in the remaining liquid, bring the total volume to 200 &mu;l
* hold the cells on ice
* Add 4 &mu;l of transposome or plasmid DNA for transformation
* Mix and transfer to chilled 2 mm gap electroporation cuvettes
* Pulse the cuvette at 2.5 KV
* Add 200 &mu;l of chilled 1161 medium from a 2 ml tube, mix with the pipet
* Transfer the cuvette contents back into the same tube, repeat
* Place the 2 ml tubes into the 30&deg; incubator for outgrowth for 3 hours
** cells can be held at 4&deg; following outgrowth
** dilute 1 &mu;l of the culture into 1 ml of 1161 medium, vortex, and dilute again into 1 ml.  Plate 200 &mu;l on a nonselective 1161 plate for counting untransformed CFUs.
* Plate 200 &mu;l aliquots on selective plates
* Culture 200 &mu;l in 10 ml selective liquid culture
* grow plates and medium at 30&deg; for colonies or color change


Notes 9/6/07: Arcing at 1.8 and 1.6 KV; possibly we need a second wash and/or some additional delay in the wash to remove more salt.
Gel loading tips do not work.  Plating 125 ul seems to work well.  Tested outgrowth at 2 ug/ml, 4 ug/ml, 8 ug/ml
