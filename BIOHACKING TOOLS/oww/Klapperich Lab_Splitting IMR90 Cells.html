==Overview==

Replace this sentence with a brief description of the protocol and its goal.

==Materials==

*PBS
*Trypsin/EDTA

==Procedure==
#Put supplemented media, PBS and Trypsin/EDTA solution in the 37C water bath to heat up.
#Look at cells in the optical scope to make sure that they are 80% confluent before splitting.
#Aspirate old media
#Dispense 10 ml of PBS into the plate to wash the cells (it is important to remove the media, since the media inhibits trypsinization of the cells).
#Aspirate the PBS.
#Dispense 2 ml of Trypsin/EDTA solution into dish, make sure that the solution covers the bottom of the dish.
#Aspirate the Trypsin/EDTA solution after 15 seconds.
#Cover the plate with its lid.
#Place the plate in the incubator for 30 seconds â€“ 1 minute.
#Remove plate back to biohood.
#Dispense 10 ml of media into the plate.
#Pipette vigorously up and down about 5 -10 times. (be careful not to get the media into the filter at the top of the pipet aid, also be careful about creating spray in the biohood)
#Look at the suspension in the optical scope to make sure that they are detached. They will look rounded and floating.
#Count the cells using the hemacytometer 
#If you cannot count, assume that there are 250,000 cells/ml in your suspension.
#Take up the suspension into your pipette.
#Dispense 500,000 cells into each new plate you want to create (in the case when you cannot count, this is 2 ml of the suspension).
#Dispense 8 ml of fresh media into each new plate to bring the total media in each new plate to 10 ml.
#Gently tip the plates to distribute the cells evenly.
#Label the plates with the following:
**Cell type
**Population Doubling Number
**Date
**initials
#Replace the new plates in the incubator.
#Aspirate any leftover media from the old plates
#Bleach out the old plates and put them in the biowaste.
