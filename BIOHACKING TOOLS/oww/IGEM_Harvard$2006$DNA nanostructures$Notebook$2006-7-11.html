Reconstituted lyophilized [http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/search/ProductDetail/SIAL/T6634 bovine thrombin]
* biuret is 745 NIH units = 637 {{ug}} (1170 NIH units = 1 mg)
* "A suggested concentration for preparation of a stock solution is 100 units/ml. The solution should contain approximately 0.1% BSA for stability and is stable for about one week at 0-5 °C. Since thrombin solutions adsorb to glass, it is recommended to aliquot the solution in plastic tubes and store at -20 °C or below." [http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/sigma-aldrich/product_information_sheet/t6634pis.pdf]
* Made a stock solution: reconstituted 745 NIH units in 0.490 mL of 0.1% BSA to give a working stock of 1520 units / mL = 1299 {{ug}} / mL = 20 nmol / mL = 20 {{um}} (formula weight is approximately 65 kDa [http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/sigma-aldrich/product_information_sheet/t6634pis.pdf])
** 0.1% BSA = 20 mg BSA in total volume of 20 mL water
* stock solution stored in one of the blue benchtop coolers in the door of the -20{{c}} freezer

Diluted thrombin stock
* 5 {{ul}} of 20 {{um}} thrombin stock and 45 {{ul}} 0.1% BSA to make 2 {{um}} stock
* briefly vortexed protein / BSA sol'n mixture (perhaps a poor idea? [[User:Matthewmeisel|Matthewmeisel]])
* stored in one of the blue benchtop coolers in the door of the -20{{c}} freezer

Diluted 5x [[IGEM:Harvard/2006/Stock_solutions#Bock.27s_selection_buffer|Bock's selection buffer]]
* 1,000 {{ul}} selection buffer and 250 {{ul}} water to make 4x stock
* stored in a microcentrifuge tube with the other buffer bottles

Diluted 6hbah1 aptamer
* 2 {{ul}} of 100 {{um}} aptamer stock and 98 {{ul}} water to make 2 {{um}} stock
* stored in a microcentrifuge tube in the "Shawn nanotube supplies" box at 4{{c}}

Loading dye
* 100 {{ul}} 5x Bock selection buffer, 400 {{ul}} water, 500 {{ul}} glycerol, small spatula-tip of bromthymol blue (sodium salt) to make 10x stock
* stored in a microcentrifuge tube with the other loading dyes by the electrophoresis tanks in the large lab room

Thrombin-aptamer binding experiment (based on [[http://openwetware.org/wiki/IGEM:Harvard/2006/DNA_nanostructures/Protocols|Dr. Shih's assay]]):

* General info:
** All ingredients pipetted into respective 0.2 mL PCR tubes
** Final volume of each: 4 {{ul}}
** Used aptamer 6hbab1 (5'-AGGATCCCCGGGTACCGGCTAGTACCCGTATAGGTTGGTGTGGTTGG-3'), which binds to a standard 6-helix-bundle nanotube (5' end) and contains a thrombin aptamer sequence (3' end)

* Incubated at room temperature for 30 min. (Turned out to be closer to 45 min.)
* Added 5 mL 1x Bock's selection buffer and 1 mL 10x loading dye
* Loaded onto a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (10% to 20% gradient) at 4{{c}}
** Lanes 1-3: loading dye (practice)
** Lanes 4-8: tubes 1-5, respectively
** Lanes 9-10: empty
** Lanes 11-12: Lewis' experiment
* ran 10-20% Invitrogen polyacrylamide gel at 15 V starting at 4:15 pm at 4{{c}} (tank in refrigerator, power supply outside at room temperature)

Results of the gel are on the [[IGEM:Harvard/2006/DNA_nanostructures/Notebook/2006-7-12|July 12]] page
