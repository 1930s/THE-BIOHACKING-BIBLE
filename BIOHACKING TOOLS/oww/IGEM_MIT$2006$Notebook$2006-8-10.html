==PCR of pchBA==

...it worked! The following showed bands on the gel and are currently in the fridge (pcr cleaned up):
*pchBA pcr'ed w/ new forward and reverse primers, with 2&mu;L betaine added to pcr rxn [53.3 ng/&mu;L]
*pchBA pcr'ed w/ new forward and reverse primers, with 4&mu;L betaine added to pcr rxn [9.9 ng/&mu;L]
*pchBA pcr'ed w/ new forward and reverse primers, with a 96deg (instead of 94deg) denature step...we stopped the reaction on cycle 21 out of 30 b/c we needed the block for mutagenesis [17.8 ng/&mu;L]
*pchA pcr'ed w/ new reverse primer (and the old forward one), with 2 &mu;L betaine added to pcr rxn [64.2 ng/&mu;L]

next steps: biobrick, do the pchA mutagenesis, hook it up to terminator, RBS, promoter!

==Indole KO Strain==

The following table summarizes the results of the indole KO transformations.

|'''pUC18'''
|lots
|essentially uniform in size (though denser areas contain smaller colonies); well spread across plate
|-
|'''J45100'''
|~110
|many tended to grow in clusters; range of sizes from very small to large (though large colonies may be more than one)
|-
|'''J45120'''
|~70
|not as many clusters; the colonies are huge, in general (a few small ones, though)

#Regrew THI3 culture because not enough cells
