There are a number of issues which plague gels far a variety of reasons. This page will contain some of the more common problems and show examples of gel images that have those problems.

So if you get a gel with something bizarre, keep the image and post it here so that others can learn from your trouble.

Possible unexpected bands:
==Supercoiled==
==Nicked==

==Primer-dimers==

The bright fuzzy bands at the bottom of the gel are typical of those caused by primer dimers.  Primer-dimers can be minimized by using hot start PCR or by using a higher annealing temperature.  Preventative measures include [[Designing primers|designing primers]] that do not form homo- or hetero-dimers.

==Empty site in BB vector (~300bp band)==


Can anyone explain this smearing?  Is it nonspecific primer binding?  Nuclease activity?  The gel is the product of PCR to amplify clpX from a Sauer lab plasmid.  The lanes are from left to right: 2 log ladder, 0.5 ng template, 5 ng, and 13 ng.  The 13 ng seem to give the desired product at around 1275 bp.  Should I go even higher in template mass?  I'd appreciate any suggestions on optimizing primer-template ratio.
