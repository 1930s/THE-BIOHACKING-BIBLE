== Research Interests ==
My scientific interests lie in the field of infectious diseases, especially insect-borne. Malaria is a leading parasitic disease transmitted by ''Anopheles'' mosquitoes. It affects half of the global population and kills 1-3 million people every year, the vast majority children aged below 5 in sub-Saharan Africa. My research focuses on the understanding of molecular and cellular interactions between ''Anopheles'' mosquitoes and malaria parasites, ''Plasmodium'', using functional genomics and emphasizing on mosquito midgut infection, the most critical stage in the malaria transmission cycle. It utilizes both laboratory model transmission systems, i.e. ''Anopheles'' mosquitoes and rodent parasites ''Plasmodium berghei'', and naturally interacting populations of ''Anopheles gambiae'' and human parasites ''Plasmodium falciparum''. Detail understanding of parasite/mosquito interactions may guide development of novel control strategies to control the disease.<br><br>
'''Current research projects:'''<br>
'''•	'''Functional genomic dissection of the Anopheles gambiae tissue responses to Plasmodium developmental stages<br>
'''•	'''Comparative genomic analysis of the mosquito responses to the rodent parasite Plasmodium berghei and the human parasite Plasmodium falciparum in natural transmission conditions in Africa <br>
'''•	'''Molecular and cell biological analysis of Plasmodium migration through the mosquito midgut <br>
'''•	'''Monitoring of the sporogonic developmental transcriptome of Plasmodium berghei and its interaction with the mosquito transcriptome<br>
