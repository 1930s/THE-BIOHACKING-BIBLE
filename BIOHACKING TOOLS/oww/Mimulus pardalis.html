*This species was recognised by Pennell (1950) but has been reduced to synonymy by most other authors. It is a serpentine endemic restricted to ultramaphic substrates in the mid Sierra Nevada, California. It has narrower leaves than M. guttatus. It is a highly branched, small annual species, believed to be self-fertilising. It does not form cleistogamous flowers.
