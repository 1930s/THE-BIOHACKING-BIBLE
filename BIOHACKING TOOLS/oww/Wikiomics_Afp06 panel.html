The [http://biofunctionprediction.org Automated Function Prediction 2006 meeting] will have a discussion panel, with our keynote speakers answering audience questions.

We have decided to solicit questions from participants prior to the meeting, out of which a few will be picked for the panel session.

Any questions relevant to the computational [[Wikiomics:Protein function prediction | prediction of the function]] of biological molecules are welcome.

OK, I'll go first:

# What are the main challenges to creating a Critical Assessment of Function Annotation (CAFA) contest, in the spirit of [[wikipedia:CASP | CASP]] and [http://capri.ebi.ac.uk/ CAPRI]? (Iddo Friedberg)
# How would metagenomics impact the field? (Iddo)
# How is structural genomics already impacting the field? (Iddo)
# description of function: are ontologies the only way to go about it? (Iddo)
# How can we have an expected level of function assignment for a genome depending on literature coverage? Example: PMID 15864286 <cite>janssen05</cite> (Christos)
# Derive a more sophisticated scale of function assignment/annotation consistency? What is a 'good' function prediction? Example: PMID 11864365 <cite>ouzounis02</cite> (Christos)
# Function prediction for non-coding or non-translated elements. Example of the first would be genomic regulatory elements, of the second would be RNA. (Iddo, Adam)
# What is the proportion of proteins that have multiple functions at the molecular level? no function at all? (''troll warning'') - the point being: what evolutionary path does a protein follow in terms of function? (a) Gain of function first and eventually duplication (2 functions at the same time) or (b) duplication, loss of function, gain of a new function ([[User:Martin Jambon|Martin]])
# Do we need to include structural information into prediction models or does the primary structure already contain all the information we need to know to infer function? (Dani)
