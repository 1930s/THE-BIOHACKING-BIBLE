==Future possibilities==
(person in brackets owns a copy)
	<br>- ''A Trip to the Moon'' (1902) [Xaq], early Méliès adaptation of Vernes's classic (only 14 minutes long)
	<br>- ''Nosferatu'' (1922) [Xaq] - an adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula novel (without official permission from Stoker's estate) and a classic example of German expressionism (it is the inspiration for all subsequent uses of shadow-work associated with Dracula), it is also loaded with Weimar Republic Germany anxieties of anti-semitism and social malaise.
	<br>- ''Metropolis'' (1926) [Xaq]
	<br>- ''Freaks'' (1932), directed by Tod Browning (a.k.a. director of the English-language 1931 version of Dracula) this movie is a great illustration of inter-war anxieties about "otherness" and all of the dismembered veterans of WWI 
	<br>- ''King Kong'' (1933)
	<br>- ''Modern Times'' (1936) [Xaq]
	<br>- ''The Bad Seed'' (1956), typical 1950s subliminal eugenics and crude psychology all mix in one.  (This choice lends itself more to the "Mystery Science Theatre 3000" genre than to a class of film that should be taken seriously.)  Good stuff!
	<br>- ''Through a Glass Darkly'' (1961), Ingmar Bergman film on the subtle terror of schizophrenia
	<br>- ''Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb'' (1964) [Xaq]
