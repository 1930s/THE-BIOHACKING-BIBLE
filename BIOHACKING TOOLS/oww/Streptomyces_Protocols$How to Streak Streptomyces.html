==How to Streak ''Streptomyces''==

'''Growth'''
<br/>
''Streptomyces coelicolor'' grows best on the media SFM (Soya Flour Mannitol), for the recipe see the Practical ''Streptomyces'' Genetics book <cite> Kieser-PracticalStreptomycesGenetics-2000 </cite>.
Slightly thicker plates are needed when inoculating ''Streptomyces'' as they take longer to grow than other general laboratory bacteria, ~4-5 days. This is partially due to it having a more complex life cycle (germination &rarr; vegetative growth &rarr; aerial growth &rarr; sporulation) and its preferred incubation temperature is 28-30ÂºC.


'''Selecting a Colony and Collecting Spores'''
<br/>
Normally ''Streptomyces'' is streaked from a single, isolated colony, however; the same can also apply when streaking from a spore stock.
In a laminar flow hood or other sterile conditions; use the wide flat end of a sterile toothpick to scrape the grey/brown spores from a single ''Streptomyces'' colony, being careful not to touch other colonies or dig into the agar. For best results, the spores are then used for inoculation by one of the following methods.
