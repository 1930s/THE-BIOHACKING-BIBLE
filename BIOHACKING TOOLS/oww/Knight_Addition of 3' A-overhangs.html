==Overview==
This protocol adds 3' A-overhangs to a PCR product rendering it suitable for TA cloning.

==Materials==
*Taq polymerase
*A heat block equilibrated to 72&deg;C

==Procedure==
#After amplification with the proofreading polymerase, place vials on ice and add 0.7-1 unit of Taq polymerase per tube. Mix well. It is not necessary to change the buffer. A sufficient number of PCR products will retain the 3´ A-overhangs.
#Incubate at 72&deg;C for 8-10 minutes (do not cycle).
#Place on ice and use immediately in the TOPO cloning reaction.

==Notes==
*I have not yet tried this protocol!
* An alternative is TdT with ddATP.
