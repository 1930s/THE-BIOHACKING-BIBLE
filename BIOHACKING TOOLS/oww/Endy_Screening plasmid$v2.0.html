The main goal of Screening Plasmid 2.0 is to enable performance similar to [[Endy:Screening plasmid 1.0|SP1.0]], but at a lower copy (either 3 or 4 series plasmids from the [[Registry]].)  Additionally, we would like to be able to move the SP into a wider range of strains.  SP1.0 is limited to strains with a knockout in the native arabinose transporter as well as requires co-transformation with pJat8 (Keasling), due to reliance on the pBAD induction system.
