== Singleton ==
See [http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/66531 Jeff Pitman's] solution in the comment section in the Python Cookbook.  Test code looks like

<syntax type="python">

class Singleton(object):
    """The Singleton Class Definition"
    def __new__(cls,*p,**k):
        if not '_the_instance' in cls.__dict__:
            cls._the_instance = object.__new__(cls)
        return cls._the_instance

#Create 3 instances of Singleton
s = Singleton()
t = Singleton()
q = Singleton()

#Note that you can see that they are the same
#object by the hex id of the objects
print s
print t
print q

#You can also see that since they have the
#same id's
id(s) == id(t) == id(q)

#Now try an inheritance example
class SingletonChild(Singleton):
    """Inherited from the Singleton class."""
    pass

w = SingletonChild()
m = SingletonChild()

#Note w and m are the same
id(w) == id(m)

#But w and s are different
id(w) == id(s)

</syntax>


== Chain of Responsibility ==
* Very useful for handling dependincies in inputs for pipeline code
* See [http://www.python.org/workshops/1997-10/proceedings/savikko.html Design Patterns in Python]


<syntax type="python">
class Event:
    def __init__( self, name ):
        self.name = name

class Widget:
    def __init__( self, parent = None ):

    def Handle( self, event ):
        handler = 'Handle_' + event.name
