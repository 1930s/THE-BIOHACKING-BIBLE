<b>S.Lo's Notes:</b><br>
<u>Quorum, Stephanie and George</u><br>
*Read literature: how much steepness do we want for quorum? (Might not be necessary given correct controls)
*Use ridiculous wavelength for light scattering / cell growth (test on non-fluorescent constructs to ensure this works)
*How to ensure J-T is not self-induction?
**Fluorescent microscope
**Knock-out OHHL from one construct ...? Figure this out ... schematic ...
*Wash during/with dilution
*Make plots from now on as RFU versus cell number rather than time
<br>
<u>Fec Project, Shaunak and Ellenor</u><br>
*Successful site-directed mutagenesis to remove Pst/Spe sites
*Chose 4 targets
*Grew up bacteria from Germany: AA93 (Fec knockout) and two other types
*No growth from cotransformation (flawed protocol?)
**Low probability of both plasmids uptaken
**Use more sample
*Figure out vector these are in
*Mutagenesis for library?
*Electroporation of cells that already have plasmid
<br>
<u>MACS, Kevin</u>
*OmpA1 ran through 3 different assays and one FACS
**Unsucessful; OmpA1 likely less robust as we had originaly thought
**Exact reasons not clear yet 
*His/strep tag attached to AIDA-1 instead - perhaps will express better results as surface expression protein
*Try Sammy's strategy: insert tags to loop region of OmpA1 construct
*No solid evidence that membrane proteins are binding well
*Perhaps - obtain constructs from literature and see if these work as claimed?
**Just need to find one strategy that works
*Can be tied to Fec system - if loop region is changed, might as wel use it for targeting as well as signaling (simultaneously?)
*Dilute our cells down: be more conscious about fluorescent antibodies - we had used a lot of cells
**Dilute samples largely; more antibodies per cell; FACS and MACS again
*Elongate incubation with antibodies: our 10 minutes were probably too short
*Detection limit: Call company to ask?
<br>
<u>New Strategies: Sammy</u>
*Sequential PCR
*Forward primer with random-er
*ligate two products
*MACS worked this past spring - discuss protocol in future
