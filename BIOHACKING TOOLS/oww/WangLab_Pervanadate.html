=== Time to prepare ===
10 minutes

=== Ingredients ===
* H<sub>2</sub>O
* HEPES, 20 mM
* Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub> (in freezer)
* Catalase (in freezer)
* Hydrogen Peroxide, or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, 30%.

=== Preparation of pervanadate (Huyer G et al., JBC 1997) ===
#	Take one tube of 100mM sodium orthovanadate Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub> (Must be white/colorless. If it shows yellow, means VO<sub>4</sub> forms 12mer, cannot use.)
#	Prepare 20mM HEPES adjust PH to 7.3
#	Take 30% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> dilute 10 times with HEPES buffer, 5 ul 30% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + 45 ul HEPES buffer, mix gently. 
#	Dilute 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> 10 times further with HEPES buffer, 5 ul 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + 45 ul HEPES buffer, mix gently.
#	Add in 10ul 100mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 940ul H<sub>2</sub>O. Mix by gently reversing the vial. This will make up a 1mM pervanadate stock. 
#	After 5 minutes, use the tip of pipet to scoop a small amount of catalase, mix in to the pervanadate stock. This will result in a burst of O<sub>2</sub> bubbles. Open the lid of the tube to release the air pressure.
#	The pervanadate is good for several hours (<24 hours).
