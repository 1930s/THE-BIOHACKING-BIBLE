== 6/27 plasmid gel, performed by Stephanie ==

[[Image:Gelpostpcrplasmid0627.jpg|thumb|left|250px]]

Description: Gel using Lpp+OmpA1+pet29 and LppOmpA2+pet29 

Explanation: 
For further information concerning amounts of plasmid in sample, please refer to Stephanie's notebook page (under Stephanie's personal page, shlo/notebook)
Wells are as follows:<br>
Well 1: 10uL ladder of 1kB plus, from Invitrogen
<i> Note: this ladder cannot be used to quantify - perhaps a reason we should just use 1kB ladder, rather than 1kB+, in the future</i><br>
Well 2: 1uL OmpA1plasmid (diluted to 20uL)<br>
Well 3: 3uL OmpA1plasmid (diluted to 20)<br>
Well 4: 1uL OmpA2plasmid (diluted to 20)<br>
Well 5: 3uL OmpA2plasmid (diluted to 20)<br><br>
