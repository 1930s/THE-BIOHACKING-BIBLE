Jodi was our first technician and did a fantastic job setting up the lab. She has moved on to greener pastures at the University of Washington, where she is a graduate student in the Department of Biology. Before coming to UC Davis, Jodi worked with Ingrid Parker and Donald Smith at UC Santa Cruz, using analytical chemistry to study invasive plant species.<br>
