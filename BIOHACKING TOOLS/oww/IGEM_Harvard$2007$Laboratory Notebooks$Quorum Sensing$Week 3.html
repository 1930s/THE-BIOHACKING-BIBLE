====Constructing Growth Curves====
Stephanie used the plate reader and Bl21+[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_I13263 I13263] cells diluted 1:10, 1:20, 1:30, 1:40, 1:50, 1:60, 1:70, 1:80, 1:90, and 1:100 as well as to construct a growth curve of OD vs time.

====Liquid Cultures====
Stephanie grew liquid cultures of I5311, OmpA1+his, I13522, T9002, and I13263 in preparation for induction on 07/03/07.

====Digestion ====
Perry performed the following digests:
* [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_R0011 R0011] with SpeI and PstI 
* [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_R0040 R0040] with SpeI and PstI 
* [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_R0051 R0051] with SpeI and PstI 
* [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_S03608 S03608] with EcoRI and SpeI
* [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_S03623 S03623] EcoRI and SpeI 
* [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_J37034 J37034] XbaI and PstI (x2) 
* [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_B0015 B0015] EcoRI and SpeI

Perry and Stephanie also ran a gel and gel-extracted the result. However, the J37034 did not turn out as expected so Stephanie ran another digest on the J37034

====Results of the Growth Curves====

====Digests====
Perry and Stephanie digested the E0240, S03608, S03623, and B0015 parts in order to rebuild the J37034.

====Ligation and Transformation of Parts====
Perry and Stephanie ligated with Quick Ligase: 7ul S03608/S03623 + 3ul B0015 in pSB1AK3. They then transformed the ligated parts into 20ul Top10.

====Plate Reader Fluorescence Setup====
Stephanie set up a plate reader experiment for fluorescence.

"First, I loaded the machine with cells (dilution - 1:10 ... maybe will dilute in greater amounts next time, eg 1:100?) and watched OD. Around 0.3OD I took them out, transferred to a clear/black 96-well plate (next time, will start with one of these), and induced cells with OHHL."

Stephanie transferred plates of the ligations from the incubator to the fridge. She also checked the results from the plate reader fluorescent readings.

====Colony PCR====
Stephanie prepared a colony PCR of several colonies of S03608-B0015 and S03623-B0015

[[Shlo/notebook#07.2F02|Stephanie's notebook entry]]

The results were not good.

====Colony PCR of F2620====
Stephanie and Perry prepared and ran a colony PCR of F2620

[[User:Perry/Summer_2007#7.2F6.2F07|Perry's notebook entry]] (including results - second gel)
====Digestion, Ligations, and Transformations, Oh my!====
Stephanie and Perry digested and ligated the following parts:

where X>Y indicates that the piece X was ligated into the larger piece Y, containing the vector.

Stephanie and Perry also transformed all the above parts into Top10 cells. In addition, they transformed the following parts into Top10 cells:
