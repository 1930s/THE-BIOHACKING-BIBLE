Some interesting facts <cite>Muller-Hill-1996</cite>

*A tetramer of 4 identical subunits
*Each subunit is 120kD.
*Active only as a tetramer.
*Mutations in some of the codons of the N-terminal 60aa or C-terminal 100aa results in an inactive, dimeric &beta;-galactosidase. <cite>Beckwith-1970</cite>
*If the above sequences are deleted, the missing protein fragment can be replaced by the corresponding peptide.  This is called intracistronic alpha or omega complementation respectively.
*Its N-terminal 23 residues can be replaced by any amino acid residues without affecting the enzymatic activity.
*A mutant with an internal deletion of codons 21-41 of the lacZ gene does not produce any active &beta;-galactosidase.
*A mutant with a deletion of everything past residue 60 (i.e. it expresses only the first 60 N-terminal amino acids) does not produce any active &beta;-galactosidase.
*You can measure lacZ activity using flow cytometry.  See [http://www.cyto.purdue.edu/flowcyt/research/micrflow/jepras/jepras2.htm A flow cytometric study of stationary phase gene expression in E.coli using lacZ reporter gene fusion]
**This paper uses [http://probes.invitrogen.com/media/pis/mp02904.pdf C<sub>12</sub>FDG] from Invitrogen.  However, FDG might be a better substrate in gram-negative bacteria like ''Escherichia coli'' <cite>Plovins-ApplEnvironMicrobio-1994</cite>
*Alpha-complementation of &beta;-galactosidase does not seem to yield activities equal to wildtype &beta;-galactosidase. Depending on the fragment, the activity can be up to 24% of wildtype <cite>Zamenhof-JBacteriol-1972</cite>.  '''(If anyone has a better reference comparing results from a Miller assay of alpha-complementated &beta;-galactosidase with wildtype, please include it here.)'''
