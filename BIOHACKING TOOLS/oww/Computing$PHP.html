==Notes==
Apache2 has a slightly different configuration system than the previous version.  In addition to the main configuration file (<tt>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</tt>), it places the module-specific configuration files into <tt>/etc/httpd/conf.d</tt> directory.
Both PHP4 and PHP5 will add a <tt>LoadModule</tt> line into <tt>httpd.conf</tt> at the installation time by default.  This line should be moved to <tt>/etc/httpd/conf.d/php.conf</tt> instead.
