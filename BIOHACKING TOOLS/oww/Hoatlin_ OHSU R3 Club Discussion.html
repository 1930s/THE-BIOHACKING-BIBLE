===Objectives===
DRAFT: Cross-departmental workshop composed of students, postdocs, and faculty with shared interest in basic principles and emerging discoveries in DNA replication, recombination and repair. The goal of the meetings is to establish a challenging and interactive venue that will advance understanding of our individual projects and encourage collaborations

*Topoisomerase and DNA R3-(Alex will suggest)
*Chromatin remodelling and DNA R3- Igor
*DNA Methylation -suggestions for outside speaker?
*HJ resolution
*Translesion Synthesis

*NHEJ (Henri?)
*PHD FIngers (Maureen)
*Fragile sites (Matt?)-Glover (Matt please send me email and contact info)
*Mph (Dan P?)
*Posttranslational modifications-(SUMO, Ub, etc.) Henri suggested ...any ideas aboout who to invite?
*Markus-Henri volunteers Markus to speak about stem cell R3

===Day and time still acceptable? If not suggest alternative===
*consensus at meeting is to keep time and day the same
*First Tuesday of every month, except summer when we consider increasing

*everyone agrees they want snacks, Alex suggests that the presenting person assign the snack, ca 15USD limit

===Ideas for seminar speaker invitations===
if you made a suggestion, please fill in the details.

*Ted Weinert (yeast geneticist)...with Dan P as preview?--invited and accepted. watch BMB seminar page for dates.
*Henri would like to have someone suggest a speaker for protein modifications (sumo, ub)
*Johannes Walter?
*Need someone who works on bacterial R3 systems Chi... recombination guy at Hutch?
*Maria Jasin or postdoc
*Representative for Replication; Ragu? Johannes, aladjam

===When we have an invited speaker, should host lab hold a preview?===
yes, everyone present thinks this is good. 

*Patrick Sung, Amanda
