:Researchers have come another step closer to understanding what made the influenza strain of 1918 virus so devastating. In this week's issue of Nature, a team of scientists describes for the first time what happens at the genomic level in animals infected with the killer virus. The infection rapidly turned on a wide range of genes involved in immune system activation and cell death, they conclude, bolstering the hypothesis that the greatest harm may not have been done by the virus itself, but by an over-reactive immune system. --[[User:Hartigan|Hartigan]] 13:00, 2 October 2006 (EDT)

:It was reported that elevation of the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) by a calcium ionophore increased the release of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Freely diffusible hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is implied to alter Ca2+ homeostasis, which further enhances abnormal cellular activity, causing changes in signal transduction, and cellular dysfunction.
