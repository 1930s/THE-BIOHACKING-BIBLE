Poission Stats
-So far leaned about the PMT or Photo-Multiplier-Tube and the Sinltlator.
-Apperantly the PMT acts like a solid state photo diode which is the reason why it is sensitive to light.
-The sintlator converts gamma rays to UV by having the gamma rays colide with some small dopped particals on the crystle producing UV light where the UV light is detected by the PMT, converted into current.
