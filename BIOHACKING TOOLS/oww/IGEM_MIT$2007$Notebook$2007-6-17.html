*Paper Research

===Notes from Evening Meeting===

*Attendance:  SK, LBH, FL, DL, JH, AL, TTP
*Univ. Latin America -- iron biosensors?
*Cadmium surrounding bacteria
*Our goal: to detect and capture (stick to) metal
*Find papers for...
**metal-induced detector/promoter
**bacteria turned on by metal?  genes turned on by metal in surroundings?
**similarly, glass/plastic-induced?
*See the arsenic project for planning genes
**Example = lactose -- binds to molecule in cell -- prevents/enhances transcription factor
*Prairie View (Texas, 2005): trimetallic sensor, bound to GFP?
**iron promoter
**see References
**did they get it to work? (Yes)
**use their BB part (input)
*Note on BB Registry: green/red color coding indicates usability
*Possible contacts (to get parts/organisms)
**UC Santa Barbara (JH Waite -- Organic Chemistry -- Marine Biotechnology Building --http://www.chem.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/waite/index.shtml)
**Prairie View
**Pohang University, Korea  (will ask my dad about Korean research culture)
*Filters: if bacteria stick to wall of filter system, clean water will result
**What is the state of the art water filtration system?
*Specificity: what will the bacteria bind to?
**Limitations -- peptide binds to certain things; have promoters?
*Find bacteria engineered to recognize multiple things?
*Are sticky peptides expressed on the surface of bacteria?
*Linear surface protein; N and C termini both pointing outside on E. coli [Toan]
*How to ensure all metal in whatever solution (water?) is, indeed, gone?

===Further Research===
*Stickiness; Detection and Capture; How are environmental problems solved today?  Also, what is a hard-to-capture metal?
*Variations on systems
**(1) Make bacteria take in/capture metal (ingest/engulf) --> become more sticky --> sticks to surface/wall/filter wall [dead cells will not matter]
**(2) Proteins are expressed outside, stick to metal, stick to each other and clump -- the bacteria are always present, but only functional when metal is present
*Input: metal?  light?  should be straightforward and logical
**Metal promoter in existence? (Texas)
**Will metal bind DNA directly or is there a middle man?
*Output: see if bacteria sticks to metal
===To research for a group meeting on Wednesday afternoon===
*LBH = filtration, biosystems and current methods (biofiltration?)
*AL, TTP, AK = Prairie View references list; promoters for glass/metal; gene expressed --> protein made?; downstream pathway -- what sticks to it best/easiest?  Done before?  Can we obtain it?; iron genes
*JH, SK = stickiness, what sticky protein can bind to; how to carry out exactly; other organisms (vs. mussel) that have sticky genes; is the sticky peptide on E. coli (Pohang papers) expressed on the surface?; will the sticky peptide on E. coli bind to metal?; how to stickify without killing cell, if possible; how to trigger stickiness; specific protein [mfp 1/5/3?]
*Each subgroup will have a wiki page to post links/resources/ideas/discussion
