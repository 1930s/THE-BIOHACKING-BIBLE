==Design==
[[Image:ScreeningPlasmid1.0.PNG|600px|left|thumb|'''Design of Screening Plasmid 1.0:''' We are using the Pbad arabinose-inducible induction system <cite>Khlebnikov</cite> as a tunable input.  GFP is a measure of input and RFP is a measure of output.  A Biobricks cloning site enables easy insertion of any Biobricks part.  RNase E sites create independence between the mRNA stability of the device being screened and the mRNA stability of the fluorescent proteins.  In particular, we suspect mRFP1 contains internal RNaseE cut sites and have added a hairpin 5â€™ of the coding region to slow degradation by RNase E. <cite>Smolke</cite>]]

==Characterization of Empty Screening Plasmid 1.0==
*[[Endy:Screening plasmid/v1.0/Hairpin]] - characterize effectiveness of the hairpin to stabilize the mRFP1 transcript
*[[Endy:Screening plasmid/v1.0/RNAseE sites]] - characterize effectiveness of the RNAseE sites 
*[[Endy:Screening plasmid/v1.0/Growth rates]] - characterization of growth rates under different induction levels / conditions
*[[Endy:Screening plasmid/v1.0/Steady state]] - evaluate expression levels at various time points following induction.
*[[Endy:Screening plasmid/v1.0/Characterization protocol]]
To ensure our screening system was operating as expected we measured the expression levels of GFP and mRFP1 when the plasmid did not contain a part (e.g. input equals output).

==Measurement of Parts and Devices using Screening Plasmid 1.0==
===Terminator Characterization via Screening Plasmid 1.0===
[[Image:TermDotPLot.JPG|left|300px|thumb|'''Characterization of 6 terminators from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts''' inserted into the Screening Plasmid.  The black line is the best fit to the empty screening plasmid, and serves as a standard for 0% termination efficiency.  Functional terminators should lie below the line, note that B0025 (red) is sometimes acting as a promoter.]]
