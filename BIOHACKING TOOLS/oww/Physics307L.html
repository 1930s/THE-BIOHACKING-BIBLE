The Fall 2007 Physics 307L course (led by [[User:Skoch3|Dr. Koch]]) will be an evolution of the previous semesters led by Dr. Gold.  You can find a wealth of information on [http://www-hep.phys.unm.edu/~gold/phys307L/ his website for the course.]  The experiments offered are likely to be the same as those offered in previous years.  (See [[Physics307L:Schedule|Schedule]] for list of experiments.) Any significant changes will be discussed during the first class meeting.
