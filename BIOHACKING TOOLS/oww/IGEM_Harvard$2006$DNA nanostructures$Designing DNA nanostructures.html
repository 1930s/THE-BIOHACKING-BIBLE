**The honeycomb lattice was rotated by 30 degrees relative to the first worksheet for compatibility with the ASCII representation of the honeycomb lattice. The position guides were rotated by 30 + 120 degrees. The extra 120 degrees can be considered an arbitrary addition (a generic honeycomb lattice has three-fold rotational symmetry, although your final objects using this paradigm will not be symmetric at all without using multimerization.) --[[User:Wmshih|Wmshih]] 10:45, 21 June 2006 (EDT)
