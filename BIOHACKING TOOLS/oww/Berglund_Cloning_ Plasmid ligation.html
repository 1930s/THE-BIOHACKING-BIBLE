==Notes==
Cutting the plasmid and then gel purifying the plasmid helps to get rid of false positives (the insert you cut out will be lost and that is a good thing)<br>
Cutting plasmid and insert longer is a good idea if you are not getting a high cutting efficiency (sometimes we do overnight cutting)<br>
Ligation works more efficiently if you have a much higher ratio of insert to plasmid (10:1).<br>
ligating longer can help with low efficiency<br><br>
using more ligated product in the transformation may help if you are getting low numbers of colonies<br>
<br>
Always run controls (uncut plasmid [expect lots of colonies], cut plasmid with no insert [expect no colonies], cut plasmid with insert but no ligase [expect no colonies])		<br>
<br>
The initial incubation on ice can be reduced to 2-5 min. However, if you are looking for high transfromation efficiency then you want to use the 20 min incubation.	<br>	
If you are going to be using kanamycin on your plates, you need to rescue the cells adding soc and then shaking at 37° for 1 hr<br>
If you are using ampicillin on your plates you do not need to rescue the cells<br>

From K. Henscheid (8/8/2006):<br>
For ligation/transformation:<br>
I looked up info on transforming BIG plasmids, as the construct I've been struggling with is 11kb, and was wondering if I was having transformation issues.  On www.promega.com/enotes/faqspeak/0107/fq0030.htm, they suggested a few ways to increase transformation efficiency:<br>
o use high-efficiency competent cells [who doesn't??]<br>
o use electroporation, which tends to have higher efficiency for all plasmid sizes.<br>
o decrease antibiotic concentration, as large plasmids tend to have lower copy numbers.<br>
<br>
I tried electroporation for my most recent cloning, and did a regular chemical transformation alongside.  Since I had to do a recovery step after electroporation, I recovered the NovaBlues as well: 37 deg for 30 min.  Both transformations appear to have worked well (by colony counts--my experimentals have more colonies than the negative control). So I'd suggest, if cloning doesn't appear to be working, do a recovery after transformation and before plating to increase transformation efficiency.<br>
<br>
(It should also be noted that, in this round of cloning, I stacked the deck [I didn't know where my problem was]: There was no hint of a kit--every purification (post-PCR and post-digest/SAP) was one phenol/chloroform extraction, one chloroform extraction, and an ethanol precipitation with glycogen and washing with 75% EtOH.  I quantitated insert and plasmid on the nanodrop and did the proper 3:1 insert:plasmid ratio with 100ng of plasmid.  And I did the ligation overnight in the refrigerator.  I also checked my ligations on an agarose gel for the heck of it.  All things to try, if troubles are being had.)<br>
<br>
Also useful: from the Promega T4 DNA ligase protocol, a quick way to figure out the 3:1 ratio is (kb insert * ng vector) / (kb vector) * 3 = ng insert.<br>
