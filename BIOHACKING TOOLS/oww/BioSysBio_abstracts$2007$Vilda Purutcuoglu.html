==Features of the MAPK pathway==
All cellular activations are regulated by various signal
transduction pathways. The cellular signal transduction is the
process of carrying over a signal in the cell's environment for
producing an associate response [10]. This transfer is
initiated by an external stimulus of the pathway by binding of an
external protein to a receptor, and ends with the production of the
target protein. The MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) or its
synonymous ERK (extracellular signal regulated kinase) pathway is
one of the major signal transduction systems which regulates the
cellular growth control of all eukaryotes including cell
proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis [6].
The activation of this pathway is triggered by an external stimulus
of the growth factor EGF which binds to activated tyrosine kinase
receptors and ends with the transcription and translation of the
c-Fos gene [9].

(Figure 1:Simple representation of the structure of MAPK/ERK pathway) 

The MAPK/ERK pathway has several organizational properties, which
explain its complexity. The ultrasensitivity, the bistability, the
periodic behaviour, and the existence of location-depended proteins
are some of these characteristics [9]. On the other hand
the structure of this mechanism whose main components are Ras, Raf,
and MEK proteins (Figure 1), includes a
number of phosphorylations on the protein level. The functionality
of these proteins is stochastic in nature and directed by positive
and negative feedback loops that cause either activation or
inhibition of other proteins [9,6]. Due to the
large number of interactions at the protein level, the outcome of
the signaling is not a simple linear function of the signal.
Interaction maps of the proteins or simple representation of the
pathway like given in Figure 1 are not
sufficient to exhaustively describe this complex system.

==Representation of the pathway by quasi-reactions==

Since the MAPK/ERK pathway is important in the cellular lifecycle,
it has been intensively studied
[8,5,6,1]. Some give a
qualitative description of this regulatory mechanism
[9,11]. However, none of the sources describe
the system by an explicit set of reactions. We combine these
qualitative sources for a representation of the pathway as a list of
(quasi) reactions. We use multiple parametrizations to indicate
different localization of the molecules in the cell and to describe
the protein using different binding sites and various
phosphorylations. The following set of equations, which describes
the activation of the MAPK pathway by the EGF receptor, is part of
the reaction list with 94 reactions and 51 substrates, representing
33 proteins and genes.

* EGF + Shc <math>\rightarrow</math> EGF + Shc<sub>m</sub> (translocation)
* Grb2 + SOS <math>\rightarrow</math> Grb2-SOS
* EGF + Grb2-SOS <math>\rightarrow</math> EGF + Grb2-SOS<sub>m</sub> (translocation)
* Shc<sub>m</sub> + Grb2-SOS<sub>m</sub> <math>\rightarrow</math> Shc-Grb2-SOS<sub>m</sub>
* Shc-Grb2-SOS<sub>m</sub> + Ras.GDP <math>\rightarrow</math> Shc-Grb2-SOS<sub>m</sub> + Ras.GTP

Here, Grb2, SOS, Shc, EGF, Ras.GTP, and Ras.GDP are single
proteins, Grb2-SOS and Shc-Grb2-SOS are protein complexes in the
cytosol, and Shc-Grb2-SOS<sub>m</sub> is a protein complex near the
membrane. As can be seen from the reactions, the translocation of
substrates to the membrane is expressed by the notation ''m''. For
instance the protein Shc<sub>m</sub> denotes the Shc protein translocated
from the cytosol towards the membrane. The different levels of the
phosphorylation, on the other hand, are denoted by the index p or p1
and p2 where the first two abbreviations show the
mono-phosphorylation and the latter implies the
double-phosphorylation of a protein. For example, MEK.p2 represents
the double-phosphorylated MEK protein on the S218 and S222 binding
sites.

==Modelling by diffusion approximation==

Gene regulation is commonly modelled via ordinary differential
equations (ODEs), which are based on the law of mass action and
continuous concentrations of each chemical substrate. Although ODEs
are successful to represent some reactions like linear production
and degradation, they cannot describe the small system variability
of the actual reactions. For biochemical systems, stochastic
processes are a natural choice [2,12] as these
kinds of dynamic formalization take into account the probabilistic
manner of the different biological activations, such as the
transcription of certain proteins, which occurs with low frequency
in biological time [7].

In this study under the assumption that the probability distribution
of the number of the molecules of each species at ''t'' depends on the
continuous ''t'' and continuous number of molecules, we use the
diffusion approximation to explain the change of state of each
substrate at ''t''. In this modelling the current state is found by a
Langevin approach, where a correlated noise term describes the
stochastic behaviour of the model over and above the drift term

<math>dY(t)=\mu(Y,\Theta)dt+\beta^{\frac{1}{2}}(Y,\Theta)dW(t)</math>

in which <math>dW(t)</math> is a ''s'' - dimensional vector representing
the change of a Brownian motion over time and ''s'' is the total
number of substrates in the system. <math>\mu\,(Y_{t},\Theta)=V'a(Y_{t},\Theta)</math> and
<math>\beta\,(Y_{t},\Theta)=V'diag\{a(Y_{t},\Theta)\}V</math> are mean, or drift,
and variance, or diffusion, matrices, respectively, both depending
on the state of the system ''Y'' at time ''t'', and the parameter vector
<math>\Theta=(\Theta_1,\Theta_2,\ldots,\Theta_r)^{\prime}</math> explicitly.
<math>\Theta_{j}(j=1,\ldots,r)</math> represents the stochastic rate
constant of the ''j''th reaction and ''r'' denotes the total number of
reaction. Accordingly <math>V</math> is the net effect matrix and
''r''-dimensional vector <math>a\,(Y_{t},\Theta)</math> describes the hazard of
each reaction at time ''t''. The algorithm computes the next state at
<math>t+dt</math> by replacing <math>Y(t)</math> by <math>Y(t)+dY</math> [3,4].

==Diffusion approximation for inference==

For estimating the model parameters, i.e. the stochastic rate
constants, we apply the discretized version of diffusion
approximation, which is known as Euler approximation,

<math>\Delta Y_{t}=\mu(Y_{t},\Theta)\Delta
t+\beta^{\frac{1}{2}}(Y_{t},\Theta)\Delta W_{t}
</math>

where <math>\Delta\ W_{t}</math> shows a ''s''-dimensional iid
<math>N(0,I\Delta\ t)</math> random vector.

We define our data vector as a ''(n+1)''x ''s'' matrix in which each
column indicates a vector of
<math>Y_i=(Y_{t_0,i},Y_{t_1,i},\ldots,Y_{t_n,i})</math> and ''n'' stands for the
total number of observed time step. Finally ''i'' is the indicator of
the ''i''th substrate.

Since the change in state for a given <math>\Delta\ t</math> has a multivariate
normal distribution, the probability density function associated
with this time increment is given by the following equation:

<math>f(Y_{t+\Delta\ t}|Y_{t},\Theta):=N(Y_{t}+\mu(Y_{t},\Theta)\Delta t,
\beta(Y_{t},\Theta)\Delta t)</math> 

<math>f(Y_{t+\Delta\ t}|Y_{t},\Theta)=\exp ( {-\frac{1}{2}(\Delta Y_{t}-\mu(Y_{t},\Theta)\Delta t)'|\beta(Y_{t},\Theta)\Delta t|^{-1}(\Delta
Y_{t}-\mu(Y_{t},\Theta)\Delta t)}\times(2\pi)^{-1/2}|\beta(Y_{t},\Theta)\Delta t|^{-1/2}
</math>


where <math>\Delta\ Y_{t}=Y_{t+\Delta t}-Y_{t}</math>. Then from
equation above, we derive the likelihood as

<math>L(Y|\Theta)=f(Y_{0}|\Theta)\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}f(Y_{t_{i+1}}|Y_{t_{i}},\Theta)</math>

<math>L(Y|\Theta)=f(Y_{0}|\Theta)\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}(2\pi)^{-1/2}|\beta(Y_{t_i},\Theta)\Delta t_i|^{-1/2}\times\exp ( {-\frac{1}{2}(\Delta
Y_{t_i}-\mu(Y_{t_i},\Theta)\Delta t_i)'|\beta(Y_{t_i},\Theta)\Delta
t_i|^{-1}(\Delta Y_{t_i}-\mu(Y_{t_i},\Theta)\Delta
t_i))}</math>

which is proportional to

<math>L(Y|\Theta)\propto {\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}|\beta(Y_{t_i},\Theta)|^{-1/2}}
\times\exp ( {-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(\Delta
Y_{t_i}-\mu(Y_{t_i},\Theta)\Delta t_i)'|\beta(Y_{t_i},\Theta)\Delta
t_i|^{-1}(\Delta Y_{t_i}-\mu(Y_{t_i},\Theta)\Delta
t_i))}</math>

where <math>Y_{t_i}</math> shows the state of the ''i''th substrate at
time ''t''.

As can be seen from the last expression of <math>L(Y|\Theta\ )</math>,
the conditional posterior densities of reaction rates <math>\Theta\ </math> does
not have a known distribution. We compute the posterior distribution
of <math>\Theta\ </math> using the MCMC method. Under a symmetric candidate
generator for each <math>\Theta_j(j=1,\ldots,r)</math>, we apply a
Metropolis-Hasting algorithm where the acceptance probability
<math>\alpha\ </math> is found as follows

<math>\alpha(\Theta,\Theta^{*}|Y)=\min ( {1,\frac{L(\Theta^{*}|Y)}{L(\Theta|Y)}})</math>

in which <math>\Theta\ ^{*}</math> is the candidate value.

On simulated data the sampler converges well and is able to identify
the dynamics of the MAPK/ERK pathway.
