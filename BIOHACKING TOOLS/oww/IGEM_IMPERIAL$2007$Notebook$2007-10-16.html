==pT7-GFPmut3b chracterisation==
*The '''aim''' of today's test was to chracterise the pT7-GFPmut3b with respect to temperature
*For materials and methods see the [[Imperial/Wet_Lab/Protocols/Prot1.9|Protocol]]
*The construct was tested for three temperatures: 4&deg;C, 25&deg;C and 37&deg;C 
*The reactions were sampled every hour
*The [[Imperial/Wet_Lab/Results/Res1.9|Results]] showed that pT7-GFPmut3b expressed at all three temperatures and the fluorescence is the highest for greater temperatures
