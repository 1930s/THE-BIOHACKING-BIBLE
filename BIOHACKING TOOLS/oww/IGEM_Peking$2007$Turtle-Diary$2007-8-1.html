==A diary of two turtles==

Two turtles accompany us in the Switch Lab. Luping bought them on the trip to Baiyang Lake last week, and we name them Switch and Count after our 2 projects for iGEM. They’ve been getting worse since they came to us: eye disease, no food intake, and the shell no longer rigid. XL said sunshine is good for the shell as it’s good for our bone, so we took them out for sunbath today. Beijing has been cloudy for days, with heavy rain sometimes, and the sun finally came out today. Lucky turtles.
