==colony PCR of T1TE-T1T2-pcc010 and T1T2-pcc010 self-ligation==
the results are strange and hard to explain, PCR always tricky???

==re-PCR lac, rec, sul, ss1, ss2, ss3, sd1-3==
rescue through gel and digest them

==prepare some Amp+ LB plate==

==colony PCR of yesterday's plate==
sula-GFP-plx007

==re-digestion of GFP-plx007==
xbaI and XhoI

in the result, two bands through single enzyme digestion! Two sites for both XhoI and XbaI?
seem to be impossible!
maybe PCR or other procedure included some other DNA here, we need more thorough check about all these things!!!

==re-PCR double promoters==

==positive transformation==
to prepare for enough supplies
