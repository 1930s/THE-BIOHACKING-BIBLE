There is a general problem of how to communicate science to non-scientists.  

==Why should scientists care?==
#We have some sort of obligation to make science accessible to non-scientists?
#Government makes public policy partially on the basis of scientific research.  So if non-scientists in government ignore/misunderstand science, then public policy is adversely affected.
#Public perceptions of science can influence government spending priorities in science.  In some cases, negative public perceptions can even destroy scientific fields.
