==Turface preparation==
Note: For Best results do turface one week prior to desired planting day so that it has time to dry<br>
* Get two large white tubs and fill them ½ full with Pro League turface
* Rinse the turface repeatedly until the water comes off clear
** Your goal is to remove the smaller particles
* Drain off all of the water and autoclave on a dry cycle for 60 minutes
** 30 min sterilize time, 30 min dry time
* Remove from autoclave and immediately cover with foil to prevent contamination
* Place sterile [[Griffitts:Conetainers#Batting square preparation|batting squares]] in the [[Griffitts:Conetainers#Cone preparation|cones]] so that turface won't fall through
* Wipe down a funnel and a scoop with 70% ethanol
* Using the sterile funnel and scoop, fill each cone to the top with turface
* Compact the turface by lifting it and pounding it against the counter
* Fill each cone again until it is about 1 cm from the top of the cone
** It won’t compact much the second time, so be sure not to overfill
* Put on gloves and spray them with 70% ethanol
* Wipe off any extra turface not in the cones
* Cover rack with Saran wrap until you are ready to plant and place dome on it
==Cone preparation==
* Fill the sink up with water and place 200 cones into it
** Make sure that all the roots from previous experiments have been removed--this may require scrubbing each one with the brush
* When they are all clean add bleach until you can smell it easily
* Allow them to soak for one day
* After they are done soaking, place them in the freshly cleaned [[Griffitts:Conetainers#Rack preparation|rack]] so that you can place the [[Griffitts:Conetainers#Batting square preparation|batting squares]] into the cones
==Batting square preparation==
* Cut the white batting into 200 squares (~1 square inch each)
* Soak them over night in a small tub with bleach
* Stuff them into the bottom of the {{Griffitts:Conetainers#Cone preparation|cones]] using sterile technique
==Rack preparation==
* Wipe down the rack well with 70% ethanol
* Using white tape, wrap it around the top of the rack so you can label each row
* Wipe down the cover with 70% ethanol
==Planting==
# Soak the turface well a couple times so that it doesn’t dry out
## this may take 4 L of water
# Using flamed tweezers, dig a hole in the center of each of the cones designated for each plant species
# Remove parafilm from the [[Griffitts:Seed scarification and germination|germinated plants]] and add enough dH<sub>2</sub>0 to the plates to allow all the plants to be kept moist
# Using another pair of flamed tweezers plant each plant into the desired cone
## Be sure not to force the plant into the turface, so that you don’t damage the root
# Using the tweezers that are covered with turface, compact the turface around the plant
## You want the top of the cotyledon showing and that is all
# Repeat steps 4 and 5 for all the plants on the row and then steps 2-5 for all remaining rows
# After you have planted the rack cover with Saran wrap and place on the dome for a day
# On day two, when you are [[Griffitts:Conetainers#Watering|watering]], remove Saran wrap and only use the dome from then on to cover them
==Watering==
Note: On average we set an experiment for 25 days<br>
* During the first week, water every day with 1X [[Griffitts:Common_media#Broth|SNM]]
* During the second week, water every other day with autoclaved dH<sub>2</sub>0
* During the third week, water every other day with 1X [[Griffitts:Common_media#Broth|SNM]]
* During the last ½ week, water every day (except the day before you want to record your results) with dH<sub>2</sub>0
==Inoculation==
Note: Inoculation day is four days after planting, so you will want to make sure that you have steps 1 and 2 done by Day 4 of the experiment
# Grow up all your bacterial strains to singles
## This takes 2-3 days
# From those singles patch out an ~1 cm square patch
# Fill a Falcon tube with 1 mL more of dH<sub>2</sub>0 than the number of plants you will be inoculating with the same bacterial strain 
# Put enough bacteria into the tube to make the solution slightly opaque
# Vortex 
# Add 1 mL of the bacteria solution to each plant
## Be sure to dig the pipetter into the turface so that it doesn’t splash
## Make sure you keep track of where you are so you don’t inoculate the wrong plants)
# Repeat Steps 3-6 for all bacterial strains
