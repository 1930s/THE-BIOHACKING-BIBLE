Innoculate a single colony containing the TEV plasmids (pRK793 and pRIL in BL21(DE3)  cells) in 5mL of LB containing 100ug/mL ampicillin and 35ug/mL chloramphenicol.  Incubate on the roller wheel in the warm room overnight.

Innoculate 1L LB containing 100ug/mL ampicillin and 35ug/mL chloramphenicol with 1mL of overnight culture.  Grow at 37 degrees on the shaker until mid log phase (OD600 ~ 0.5).  Save about 500ul to run on a gel.  Induce cells with IPTG to give a final concentration of 1mM and reduce the temperature to 30 degrees and return to the shaker.  

After 4 hours of induction,collect cells by centrifugation (20' at 6000rpm).  Save about 500ul before centrifugation to run on a gel.

Resuspend cells in '''30 ml of 20 mM tris (pH 8) + .5 M NaCl + No Imidazole''' ''in a 50ml conical''.  

Lyse cells using a sonicator.  For a 1 L bacterial prep, sonicate on hold for 10 seconds, then set on ice for 10 seconds.  Repeat 8 to 10 times.  

Determine the lysate volume.  Add 5% polytheleneimine (pH 7.9 adjusted with Hcl) to a final concentration of 0.1%.  ''For 30ml, add 1.5ml''.

Mix the lysate by inversion, ''transfer to a centrifuge tube'', and centrifuge at 14,000rpm for 30min.  Save a small portion of supernatant and pellet to run on a gel.  The supernatant is what you want to save and run on a column.

Filter the supernatant.

Drain off the NiNTA EtOH storage solution, then equilibriate a NiNTA column.  Use 4 column volumes of '''same buffer as above'''.  Use 1mL packed resin for every 8mg of protein.  Estimate how much protein by running on a gel and comparing to marker, ''or ~3ml resin / 1L culture.
''
Load sample onto column.  Wash with 15 column volumes of '''same buffer as above'''.  Collect flow through.  Save ~100ul for a gel.

Elute with 4 column volumes of '''20 mM tris (pH 8) + .5 M NaCl + 120 mM No Imidazol'''. Save ~100ul for a gel.

Elute with 3 column volumes of '''20 mM tris (pH 8) + .5 M NaCl + 300 mM Imidazole'''.

''Add 1mM EDTA and 1mM DTT to all elution fractions''.

Run SDS-PAGE gel, and pool fractions accordingly.  The gel should be run the same day, as TEV tends to crash out.

Load onto S-200 column in cold room and run using the following buffer:  25mM PO4 (pH 8.0), 200mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2mM EDTA, and 10mM DTT.  Pool fractions.

Concentrate sample to 1mg/mL using the centricon system.
