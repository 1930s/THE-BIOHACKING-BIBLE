# Thaw competent cells (TOP10 from Invitrogen) on ice.
# Place 10-15 µL cells in pre-chilled Eppendorf tubes.
# Add 2 µL BioBrick vector (either native or ligated; so that vector is ~10-20% of the final volume), and chill on ice for 30 min. 
#*Do not pipet or vortex.
# Heat shock at 42 °C for 30 s.
# Incubate on ice for 2 min.
# Add 170 µL SOC medium (~10 x volume; Invitrogen), and shake at 37 °C for 15 min for Amp selection, or 30 min for Kan selection.
# Add all media to a selectable marker LB plate.  Use glass beads to streak the plate.
# Incubate at 37 °C.  Transformants should appear within 12 hrs.
