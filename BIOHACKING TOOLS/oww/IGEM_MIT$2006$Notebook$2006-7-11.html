#E. coli lab strain
#*We want to engineer a pleasant perfuming E. coli system that ('''with no exogenous action or input''') can grow and smell when it reaches stationary phase
#**all substrates will be biosynthesized by cells
#**stationary phase controls gene expression
#**pleasant smell does not need to compete with indole's unpleasant smell
#Methylobacteria and/or Pseudomonas fluorescens biofilter
#*combine our perfuming power into bacteria that already mop-up smelly compounds
#*colonize a biofilter with our engineered bacterial system

==Project 1: E. coli, Progress==
#Biobricks of SAMT, BAMT, BSMT, ATF1 in sequencing process
#1 smell is detectable/GC quantifiable in SAMT and BSMT cell cultures
#pUC18-derivative plasmid for SA biosynthesis via pchBA is definitely coming soon
#1 indole knock-out strain has been recieved
#Stationary phase promoter primers have been ordered

==Project 1: E. coli, To Do==
#Order Isoamyl Acetate to smell [VV] '''-done'''
#Order Isoamyl Acetate primers for 2 genes [VV] '''-1 gene done''
#Check that coding mutagenesis reactions were successful (check gel, do transformation...tomorrow: miniprep, digest, gel) [AG/KB, everyone]; nanodrop [SP]
#Hook up each biobrick coding region to a Rbs, Promotor, and Terminator [tomorrow]
#PCR out the stationary phase promoter from E. coli genome once primers arrive [SP] '''-done'''
#Make a plate of our new indole-negative E. coli strain YYC912 [KB] '''-done'''
#Make a liquid culture of our new indole-negative E. coli strain YYC912 [tomorrow] '''-done'''
#Set up an overnight culture as a GC control for tomorrow [VV] '''-done'''
#*Does it smell noticably different from regular indole-positive E. coli?? '''YES, -done'''
#*If yes, (make competent?) and transform with Dudareva SAMT plasmid and make GC measurements of methyl salicylate
#*transform with our biobrick plasmids
#Continue email follow-ups, etc. [KB]

==Project 2: Methylobacteria/Pseudomonas, To Do==
#get pWUBR (or something similar)
#*PWUBR is an E. coli to Methylobacteria shuttle vector
#*email J. Hubacek and T. Leisinger
#*search for more sources of a similar vector
#order an appropriate methylobacterium strain for lab work
#learn everything about working with/growing methylobacteria
#research biofilters and construction
#get pUCP22 (or something similar)
#pUCP22 is an E. coli to Pseudomonas shuttle vector
#*email Herbert Schweizer
#*search for more sources of a similar vector
#learn everything about working with/growing pseudomonas

<b>Hey Kate...these are the papers that I found and started looking at:</b><cite>yes, yes2</cite>.  <cite>yes2</cite> inidcates that they used conjugation to transfer their plasmids from ''E. coli'' to ''M. dicloromethanicum''.  The plasmid--S17-1--seems to be a special mobilization system.  I am reading more on this.

<b>Update:</b> OK.  So it seems that ''several'' studies have been done in which this ''E. coli'' S17-1 mobilization plasmid was used <cite>yes2, yes3, yes4</cite>, the majority of which were done by the Leisinger group in Switzerland.  Leisinger et. al cite [http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v1/n9/abs/nbt1183-784.html this reference] each time they discuss conjugal transfer of the S17-1 plasmid from ''E. coli'' to ''Methylobacterium'' in their methods.  

<b>Update2:</b> Paper <cite>yes5</cite> looks interesting.

==Wet Lab Work Completed Today==

1. DpnI digest of site-mutagenized BAMT and ATF1

2. Gel of site-mutagenized BAMT and ATF1 

3. PCR cleanup of site-mutagenized BAMT and ATF1

4. PCRed osmY out of E. coli genome

Protocol: 45 uL PCR Master Mix

2.5 uL E. coli genome (~100 copies)

1.25 uL each primer (25 uM)

The steps were:

(a) 94deg for :30 (b) 55deg for :30 (c)68deg for 2:15, then 72deg for 10:00

5. Transformed site-mutagenized BAMT and ATF1 into competent cells

==Vanillin?==
