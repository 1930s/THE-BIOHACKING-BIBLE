This is for testing the idea of implementing a scientific network (see [[Nerdbook]]) directly on the wiki. '''This is very much in development.''' If you have ideas or can implement some things, go right ahead! 

==Implementation==
* A useful tool for implementing many features may be [http://semeb.com/dpldemo/index.php/Main_Page DynamicPageList]. Check out the extensive manual.
* Use semantic mediawiki tools for searching and tagging when possible
** social networking is on this list: http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Semantic_MediaWiki/Envisaged_applications
* FOAF: http://ontoworld.org/wiki/FOAF
* Connections are all described by wiki links.
* User:Yourname/network is the special page that contains links to either other users or other pages (e.g. groups)

==Features working==
* None yet.

==Features desired==
* Sending messages to particular networks.
* Easy to use interface (either Javascript or maybe form based)

==Features that appear to be unimplementable on the wiki==
If any extensions would be helpful, list them here.
