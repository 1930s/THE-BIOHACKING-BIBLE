==CIP treatment (fail)==
CIP treated the '0S' sequence, which is J36010/SP. Will need to re-CIP treat.

The gel ran as if there was a lot of genomic DNA; additionally there is no KaiC /XP expected 1.8kb insert in lanes 3-5; and notice in lane 10 that the supposed KaiB /SP is a smudge.

Will poststain next gel to verify results.
