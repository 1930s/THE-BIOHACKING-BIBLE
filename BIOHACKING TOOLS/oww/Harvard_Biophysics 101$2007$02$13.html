*You will develop a script that can compare one or more input sequences to a reference sequence and report any interesting difference between the two.
**It will be up to you (collectively) to come up with what is "interesting".  Post your ideas to the discussion tab for this page.
*Use [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?val=K00396 ApoE] as your reference gene for this exercise.
*Check the BioPython documentation for [http://www.bioinformatics.org/bradstuff/bp/tut/Tutorial003.html#toc16 dealing with alignments]
*Rather than connecting to GenBank and downloading your reference sequence each time, try using some [http://docs.python.org/tut/node9.html#SECTION009200000000000000000 file I/O] to save a local copy of sequence data that you need to reuse.
