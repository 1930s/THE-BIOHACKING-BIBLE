==F plasmid derived replication origins==
There are at least 3 kinds of replication origins that are derived from the [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?db=nucleotide&val=9507713 F factor] of ''Escherichia coli''.

===mini-F===
*includes oriS and repE
*~1.6 kb
*used in pSCANS ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=Nucleotide&cmd=Retrieve&list_uids=6689911&dopt=GenBank genbank] [http://genome.bnl.gov/Vectors/pscans.php vector info] [http://www.genome.bnl.gov/Protocols/pscans.shtml cookbook]) or [[Synthetic Biology:Vectors/Nomenclature|pSB2K3-P1010]] series plasmids
*at copy number 4-6?  

===F plasmid derived origin used in most BACs===
*includes oriS, repE and the par genes 
*~4.6 kb
*used in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?db=nucleotide&val=1817728 pBeloBAC11] and other [[Bacterial artificial chromosomes|BACs]]
*at copy number 4-6

==="complete" F origin===
*includes repC, oriV, ccd operon, repD, oriS, repE and the par genes
*~9kb
*used by Kris Prather in her F plasmids that she built when in Jay Keasling's lab <cite>Jones-BiotechnolBioeng-1998</cite>
*at copy number 1-2

==Nomenclature==
*'''Episome:''' A circular piece of DNA that can replicate independently of the bacterial chromosome or integrate and replicate as part of the chromosome.
*'''F factor:''' An episome in bacterial cells that confers the ability to act as a genetic donor during conjugation.
*'''F+ cell:''' A bacterial cell possessing the fertility factor. Acts as a donor in conjugation.
*'''F- cell:''' A bacterial cell that does not contain a fertility factor. Acts as a recipient in conjugation.
*'''F' cell:''' A bacterial cell in which an integrated fertility factor spontaneously excises itself, taking part of the chromosome with it. The resulting episome therefore contains chromosomal material.
*'''Hfr cell:''' A strain of bacteria exhibiting a high frequency of recombination, due to a chromosomally-integrated fertility factor. This strain is able to transfer all or part of the chromosome to recipient strains.

==Mating types==
*F+ mating with F- produces 2 F+
*Hfr mating with F- produces Hfr and F-
*F' mating with F- produces F' and F' merozygote
