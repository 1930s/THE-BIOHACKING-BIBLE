==You'll Need==
*High-fidelity polymerase - ''Pfu'' (Stratagene, etc.) or Phusion (NEB)/iProof (Bio-Rad)
*A very small vector back-bone and your desired gene inserted (preferably w/o BsaI or BsmBI cut sites)
*Primers designed for your mutation (see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=1327007&dopt=Abstract Stemmer et al.] on how to do it)
*Restriction enzymes ''DpnI'' and ''BsaI'' or ''BsmBI'' or another similar restriction endonuclease
*Your favorite thermal cycler

==Step 1: PCR==
* Set up your PCR as follows for 50 uL reaction volume:
** x uL Polymerase Buffer
** 1 uL 10x to 20x diluted template
** 0.5 uL Forward Primer (30 uM) (or appropriately diluted)
** 0.5 uL Reverse Primer (30 uM)
** 1.5 uL <math>MgCl_2</math> (50 mM)
** 1.5 uL DMSO (optional)
** x uL <math>H_2O</math>
*Reaction Conditions
**Use the manufacturer specified reaction temperatures and times for optimal performance.
**Touchdown annealing from 60C to 50C with -1.0C steps
***This will be the first 10 cycles. Use your determined extension time.
**Continue with annealing at 50C and extension using determined time.
**Verify your product by standard gel electrophoresis
If your reaction yields are low, some suggest to run more than one and pool the results.
==Step 2: Digestion==
*Purify the PCR product via standard methods (Qiagen PCR prep or other well established methods)
*Set up the following enzymatic digest for a 50 uL volume
**43 uL PCR product
**5 uL 10X Buffer
**1 uL ''DpnI'' (assumed 20,000 U/mL)
***''Dpn'' digests only methylated DNA at its recognition site. This should remove all template DNA.
*React at 37C for 2 hours
*Heat inactivate at 80C for 20 minutes (optional)
*Add 1 uL BsaI (or equivalent)
*React at 50C for 2 hours
*Purify by standard methods (Gel purification, Qiagen PCR prep, etc.)
==Step 3: Ligation and transformation==
*Proceed with standard [[Silver:_Ligation|ligation]] and [[Silver:_Bacterial_Transformation|transformation]] protocols
