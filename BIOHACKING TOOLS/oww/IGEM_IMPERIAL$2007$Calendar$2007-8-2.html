== Questions ==

== Debriefing==

=== Laboratory===
The following laboratory-related activities were performed today:
*Preparation of media in the Teaching Lab.
*Completion of list of required laboratory materials.
*Completion of list of required constructs.
<br>
'''Issues/Considerations'''
*For the DNA constructs, the nature of the vectors employed by each team needs to be specified.
*A safety report (?) for each project is required by Mr D. Featherbe.
<br>

===Wiki===
Today, marked the start of the restructuring of the heavily overloaded team wiki. A refined structure was decided upon; transformation is expected to be completed by the start of the new week.
<br><br>

===Projects===
Work on the four projects continued:
<br>

====HRP====
The following tasks were completed:
*Constructs design
*Methodologies and protocols employed in the project.
*List of equipment to be used.
*Possible application in biofilm project.
<br>

====Cell-Free System====
This team completed the following:

*Protocols on vesicle formation.
*Shopping lists for Kirsten.
<br>
'''Issues/Considerations'''
*Email Christina about more information (...concerning?).
<br>

====Cell-by-Date====
Work was done on:
*Completing protocols for CBD
<br>
'''Issues/Considerations'''
*Investigation should be made of promoters ''not only'' in the registry, but also on openwetware.
<br>

====Biofilm====
The biofilm team performed the following tasks:
*Literature reading: [AHL] & Protocols for biofilm formation
*Team wiki page required restructuring/refinement. Work commenced, specifically with regards to project description.
*A consideration of a plan on how to compare results from different chassis'.
*Resources (in the form of literature) were gathered for the modelling element of this project.
*Liasing with the HRP team on possible application of the HRP system in the biofilm detection system.
<br>
'''Issues/Considerations'''
*Decision regarding choice of two possible reporters, which would be then be critically compared.
*A "catchy" name is required for this project.
*Investigation of diffusion of AHL in biofilms.
<br>

===Project Definition===
Yesterday's debriefing  yielded a considerable amount of confusion regarding the course of the team's projects; particularly the role of HRP. A new project definition was formulated on the basis of much discussion that took place after Wednesday's debriefing.
<br>

===Modelling===
Imperial's Molecular Predation Oscillator of 2006 was reviewed, with particular emphasis placed on the modelling element. A presentation on the modelling cycle followed & techniques employed will be given tomorrow.
