==Mutation Spectra==

===E. coli / Other Prokaryotes===
Several studies have been done with the lacI repressor to determine its mutation spectrum.  Roughly 70% of mutations in wt lacI occur as 4 bp additions/deletions at one site with significant self-pairing ability.  Schaaper (1991) removed this hotspot by performing directed silent mutagenesis at two bases in this region; however, deletion activity was still strongly associated with other repeated sites in the gene.
Single base-pair substitutions were also detected and seem to show a clustered pattern.  The specifics of the pattern depend on the genetic background of the bacteria - it changes when various mutation repair pathways are tweaked - but might still be useful.

===Eukaryotes===
There is some mutation spectrum work in eukaryotes, mostly done to help develop genetic testing for various human diseases.  These data may be useful as test inputs.  However, eukaryotes have different and more complicated error correction pathways.
