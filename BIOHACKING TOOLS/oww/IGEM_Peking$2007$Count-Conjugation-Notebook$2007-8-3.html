==Amplification Culture of F-OriT->pSB1A2==
*Culture at Amp+ plate for 12 hours.
*select Positive OriT-pSB1A2 Colonies from Plate,Culture in liquid LB,waiting for mini-prep.
*pSB1A2 self-ligation nagetive-control did not grow.

==Sequencing results==
*Got sequencing-corrected strains of F and R751.
*All pSC101 sent for sequencing (7 colonies) have the same point mutations in several regions.  I wonder if our strain from CGMCC is different from that in NCBI database.  I will go on with these strains and meanwhile repeat the oriT-pSC101-deleted construction.

==Amplification culture of FRS==
*Amplification culture of sequenced strains: F (No. 3); R751 (No. 3); pSC101 (No. 4).  Shake with LB-Amp+ liquid in 37â„ƒ for 16 hours.
