* <math>V_m^o = \sum_n \frac{G_n}{G_m}V_n</math>
* Rest is not equal to equilibrium
** eventually all ions would equilibrate inside and outside and there would be no membrane potential
** For this to not happen, must have pumps (primary active transport)
** Pumps allow us to go from rest to equilibrium
** treat as current source
** <math>J_n^a+J_n^p=0</math> for all <math>n</math> where <math>J_n^a</math> is the active current (pump) and <math>J_n^p</math> is the passive current (electro-diffusion).
** Define '''quasi-equilibrium''': no net flux but requires energy
** <math>J_m = 0 = \sum_n G_n(V_m^o-V_n) + \sum_n J_n^a</math>
** <math>V_m^o = \sum_n \frac{G_n}{G_m}V_n - \frac{1}{G_m}\sum_n J_n^a</math>
*** The first term is the "indirect effect" whereas the second term is the "direct effect" of the pump
*** Both terms depend on the pump as without the pump, both would be 0
** All pumps have indirect effect but only some pumps have direct effect
** A non-electrogenic pump has no net charge change (e.g. trade one sodium ion for one potassium ion)
** An electrogeneic pump such as 3 sodium for 2 potassium would have net active current
* Active transport gets energy from glucose metabolism (namely ATP)
* Experiment shows that sodium and potassium transport are linked
** Sodium is needed for potassium transport and vice-versa
** Sodium is pumped out, potassium pumped in
** The direct effect on membrane potential is negative
