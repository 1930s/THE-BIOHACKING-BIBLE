==Gel purification, Ligation and transformation of GeneArt Plasmids, natural KaiA into J04500 backbone ==

I gel purified the inserts pre-ligation, but the nanodrop gave extremely low (eg. negative) numbers. Then, I used an absolute ratio of 1:3 vector-insert instead of the normal molar ratio. DO NOT USE THIS PROTOCOL FOR SUBSEQUENT LIGATIONS! 

'''Ligation for samples the nanodrop hates'''<br>
*BB vector J04500 \SP: 2.5uL
*BB insert KaiA, B, or C \XP: 7.5uL
--------

Protocol:
*Mix above ratios + 10uL #1 + 1uL #3
**BE sure to mix #1 (ligation buffer) well especially!
*Sit at bench for ~30min
*Put back on ice

'''Transformation'''

For the transformation I did 5 samples:
*1 exp. (50uL) natural KaiA
*1 exp. (50uL) synthetic KaiA
*1 exp. (50uL) synthetic KaiB
*1 exp. (50uL) synthetic KaiC
*1 (25uL) positive
*1 (25uL) negative

Ice incubation 30m, 30s@42C, 2m@ice, SOC@1h@37C. Plated on LBCarb. Should be ready around 6PM to see.

== Liquid cultures of KaiA/B/C in Top10, J04450 + pSB4A3 in Top10 and Top10F' ==
'''Growth'''
* KaiA
* KaiB
* KaiC
* F2-3
* F2-4

'''No growth'''
* 101
* 102
* F1
* F2-1
* F2-2 

I made frozen stocks of all cultures. 600 uL culture + 400 uL 50% glycerol.

== Liquid culture of J04500 ==
The large culture of J04500 that  we inoculated yesterday for midiprepping appears to be red. We think we accidentally inoculated J04450 instead of J04500.

== Miniprep of KaiA/B/C + GeneART plasmid in Top10 ==
Eluted in 50 uL H<sub>2</sub>O.

== Restreak and PCR of J04500 + KaiA/B/C transformants ==
The plates that Peng streaked last night (see beginning of page) showed growth by around 8PM. We picked colonies, restreaked them on new plates, and did a PCR with BB primers to see whether the ligation and transformation of KaiA/B/C into J04500 was correct.
