#Stephen ligate and transform SAGD.WGD and y0078.atf1 and y0080.atf1.  Kate plate them: '''-done'''  
#Tomorrow, it'd be great if people could come in to make liquid cultures of plates 1, 2, 3, and 4 and/or colony PCR from plates 7 and 8. '''-done kb, but failed'''
#Sequencing looked good on the osmY(fn)-BGD '''(kb)''', so I say that we can fridge plates 5, 6 for now
#*should Make LCs of already good sequenced osmY(fn)-BGD A and B with substrate to be sure smell good '''-done, kb'''
