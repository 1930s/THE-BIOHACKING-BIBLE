=Tandem OriT By Qu Mingzhi=
==PCR OriT==
*get F-OriT primer,  primer vf,vf2,vr,pf1,pr1 stored as ~100uM.
*PCR system contains (totally 50uL):1uL Primer pf1, 1uL Primer pr1, 4uL dNTP, 0.5uL Taq, 1uL OriT template, 37.5uL dH20, 5uL 10X buffer,
*use different PCR program to test efficiency.
#PCR program condition 1: 94℃ 5min, 94℃ 30s, 51℃ 30s, 72℃ 30s, Go to step 2 for 29 times, 72℃ 10min, 4℃ end.
#PCR program condition 2: 94℃ 5min, 94℃ 30s, 55℃ 30s, 72℃ 30s, Go to step 2 for 29 times, 72℃ 10min, 4℃ end .
*Primer final concentration 1uM.
===electrophorsis result===

==OriT PCR product purification==
*use Transgen kit.
*40uL after purflication
===electrophorsis result===
*from ''left'' to ''right'':
#37℃ @ program 1 before purflication
#30℃ @ program 2 before purflication
#30℃ @ program 1 after purflication
#37℃ @ program 2 after purflication
#marker
*the '''left two channels''' are used to re-test the aboabnormal line that showned on PCR product electrophorsis test.

==transformation OriT==
*Use pEASY-3 as cloning vector .(Amp+)
*tramsformation system contains :3uL PCR product(after purflication), 1uL pEasy-T
*the Culture Dish(LB/Amp+) are trated with 5uL 1M IPTG & 40uL 40mg/mL x-Gal.
*'''NEXT DAY:''' 10 white cloney received.
