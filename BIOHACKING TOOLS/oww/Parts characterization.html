Characterization of standard biological parts is an essential step in enabling construction of more complicated devices and systems based on these parts.  A standard method of characterization (or several standards) will better enable sharing of parts between different laboratories, as well as improve our ability to design devices.

==Discussion Topics==
#What are the current available methods for characterization of parts?
#Which characterization methods are particularly relevant to certain parts?
#How can we ensure that these methods can easily be applied in a standardized way across labs? i.e. how do we make the information produced by an experiment be independent of the particular experiment?
#What information does each characterization method provide about a part?
#Are standard operating conditions important?
#When is the characterization of a part finished?  i.e.  What would a characterization standard look like?

==Substrate for discussion==
This is an attempt to organize some of the available characterization methodologies as well as the type of information that they generate.  It might help us formulate the beginnings of a characterization standard(s).  Feel free to edit and revise since this is very preliminary and likely has errors and is missing useful techniques.
