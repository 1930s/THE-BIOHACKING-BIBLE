[[McKinney|McKinney Lab]] uses an ethernet thermometer from [http://www.papouch.com Papouch] to monitor the temperature of our shaking incubator.  I have written some simple CGI code to record temperatures from it and display them in a useful fashion.  You will need the [http://home.gna.org/pychart/ PyChart] package installed in order for it to work properly.

[[Media:tmemonitor-20070320.tgz]] (This release is marked March 20, 2007, but it has already been running stably for us for about six months.)

===README file===
(Reproduced from the archive above.)

This is a suite of programs to record data from the TME Ethernet thermometer.  They need to be run as CGI scripts in a webserver, and have an SQLite database in the same directory containing at least the table given by:

<pre>
CREATE TABLE temperatures (
timestamp default current_timestamp,
temperature real,
primary key(timestamp) );
</pre>

The included files are:

*<tt>README</tt> - this file  
*<tt>commit_temperature.cgi</tt> - A CGI script called by the thermometer to record temperatures
*<tt>monitor.cgi</tt> - A CGI script called by the end user which displays a graph and history of the temperature at the thermometer (requires PyChart)
*<tt>page_template.py</tt> - A set of strings defining the appearance of the page returned by monitor.cgi, meant to be filled in with values using the % operator.

In monitor.cgi you will need to change the paths for temperature_database and sc
riptpath at the top of the file.  In commit_temperature.cgi, you just need to ch
ange temperature_database.
