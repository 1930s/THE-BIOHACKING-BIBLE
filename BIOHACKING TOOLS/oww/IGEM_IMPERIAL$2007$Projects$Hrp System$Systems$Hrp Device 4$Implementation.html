==Ligation strategy==
*define the way you plan to build the part (a gantt chart could be good for the sake of clarity and planning)

==Quality control==
*define the quality control used at each step 
*define possible enzymes to be used and their outcomes
*define design of primers to be used in sequencing

==WetLab work entries==

*place where to write down all the work done in the lab to build this part
*define clearly the date and person(s) involved
