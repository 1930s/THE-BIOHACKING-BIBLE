* computation using aperiodic self-assembly of DNA
** isomorphism to Wang tiles which can act as a Turing machine
* triple-crossover molecules - 4 DNA strands that pair into 3 double helices in plane
* 8 triple-crossover molecules used
** 2 x values representing inputs
** 4 y values that perform the XOR corresponding to the inputs (0,0) (1,0) (0,1) (1,1)
** 2 'corner' molecules which set up the initial conditions (bring together x_1 and y_1 for example)
* example computation (See Figure 1)
** start with C1 and C2
** C1 recruits y1=1, C2 recruits x1=1
** x1 recruits x2=0
** y2=1 can only bond to x2=0, and y1=1, therefore y2 = y1 XOR x2
** x2 and y2 can recruit x3 and y3, respectively, thereby computing a cumulative XOR
* The calculation is read out by ligating together reporter strands on each of the tiles
** Contains the series of inputs and intermediate steps in the calculation
* SAT problems in DNA computing context: 11, 14, 15
* Computation with DNA hairpins: 16
* 'This XOR computation can be used for executing one-time pad cryptosystem (theoretically unbreakable)': 17
* can also be used to specify the construction of nanomaterials algorithmically
