* Zero waste party with TPP Society
# We applied for a Student Life Grant with TPP to host a Zero Waste Party next semester.
# We will meet with them sometime over the next few weeks to discuss party details.
# Brainstormed ideas for the party:
## Showcase cool biodegradable containers.
### This is better than sustainable containers, because there is nothing novel about Tupperware.
### We can also publicize that fact that food trucks take plastic containers.
##Compost food waste from party

*Studio!Sus
#Elke talked to Sally Susnowitz at the Public Service Center
## They will be able to give us $500
## They recommended that we get a couple of addition grants for 1k. From the Deans?
# We missed the Oct. 31 deadline for a GSO or GSC permanent investments grant.

*WSC-SD
#Elke is the new president. Hurrah!

*White Paper

#We will focus on what we have already done in this area, and emphasize the need for student participation in any plan
