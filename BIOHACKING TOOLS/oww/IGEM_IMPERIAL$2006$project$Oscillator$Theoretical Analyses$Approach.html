=='''Overview of Our Approach '''==



*<font size="4"> '''Principle 1: Study of Ever More Complex Models'''</font size>

:*We took an '''incremental approach''' to the study of the 3D model. 
:*Under a reasonable set of assumptions the '''3D model can be turned into a 2D system'''. 
:*We used this property fully as we built up our analysis  towards that of the full 3D model: 
::- First we studied '''2D models'''
:::- We started with Lotka-Volterra 
:::- We increased the complexity of the model each time until we obtained the 2D model which equivalent to the 3D model (under the set of assumptions)
:::- See [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2006/project/Oscillator/Theoretical_Analyses/Results| Result]] section for list of models 
::- If '''time permitting''': the whole 3D Model

:*Breaking up the complexity of the 3D system in the way we did it had several notable advantages.
::- It allowed us to '''learn the basics''' of Dynamical Systems Analysis and practice them on simple models. 
::- By modifying the various terms of the model we got a '''better understanding''' on how they interact with each other. 
::- It allowed us to '''learn from the previous calculations''' and thus to push them further in an effective manner.

*<font size="4"> '''Principle 2: Normalisation Effort for a System Analysis''' </font size>

:In order to make our results easy to read and comprehend, we normalised the various steps of our analyses and the presentation of our results. 
   
:* '''First page of the analysis: most important results''' 
:: See the following [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2006/project/Oscillator/Theoretical Analyses/Template Results| template]] for the way we normalised 

:* '''Following Pages: Display of important simulations (and comments)'''
::see the following [http://www.openwetware.org/images/1/18/WIKI_Document_Number_4_-_Presentation_of_Results.pdf  tutorial] for a possible way to present simulation results

:* '''More detailed analyses are made available for downloading'''
:: Detailed analysis = proofs of results, full sets of simulations...
:: pdf and Doc suggested formats for attachments
