ESF (European Science Foundation) and JSPS (Japan Society for the
Promotion of
Science) jointly organized a workshop on "Functional Genomics: From the
Bench to Bioinformatics" in Kanagawa, Japan. Scientists and students
from Japan and Europe were invited to this workshop. Prof. Satoru Miyano
was one of the organizers of this workshop on behalf of the JSPS. During
the workshop Vijaya Parthiban, the current Student Council Chair, gave a
presentation explaining the benefits of collaborations between the
Student Council and other organizations. A possible collaboration with
Japanese Society for Bioinformatics (JSBi), one of the largest
bioinformatics societies in the world, was discussed. Prof. Miyano was
highly interested to coordinate the efforts taken by the Student Council
to collaborate with JSBi. Initially, the Student Council will submit a
proposal to the JSBi explaining the possibilities of having joint
ventures. Similarly, the JSBi will also share their plans and ideas.
