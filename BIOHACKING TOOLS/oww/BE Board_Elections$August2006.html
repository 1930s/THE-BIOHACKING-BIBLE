These are the available positions for the 2006/2007 BE graduate student board.  Click on the position titles for some more information about the positions or to contact the current position holders.  The descriptions below are guidelines based on previous years board initiatives.  The numbers in brackets indicate the number of positions available.  If you are enthusiastic about new initiatives or would like to see things done differently please [[BE Board:Contact|contact us]] and we'd be happy to discuss any proposed changes with you.  In short, if you have time and energy to contribute, we can make room for you!

In a change to previous years, we are trialing giving each of the Academic Chairs defined roles.  While we would like people to nominate themselves for individual academic chair positions, the three academic chairs are expected to work as a team on their initiatives.  Again, if there are other initiatives you would like to see organized, please [[BE Board:Contact|let us know]].
