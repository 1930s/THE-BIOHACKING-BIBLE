===Quotes===

Facts are stubborn things, but statistics are more pliable.
:Mark Twain (1835 - 1910)


Statistics: The only science that enables different experts using the same figures to draw different conclusions.
:Evan Esar (1899 - 1995)


I gather, young man, that you wish to be a Member of Parliament. The first lesson that you must learn is, when I call for statistics about the rate of infant mortality, what I want is proof that fewer babies died when I was Prime Minister than when anyone else was Prime Minister. That is a political statistic.
:Sir Winston Churchill (1874 - 1965)


Smoking is one of the leading causes of statistics.
:Fletcher Knebel


There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.
:Benjamin Disraeli (1804 - 1881)
