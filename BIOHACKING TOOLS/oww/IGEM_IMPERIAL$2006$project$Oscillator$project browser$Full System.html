==Motivations==

*'''Oscillators''' are a '''fundamental building block''' in traditional engineering applications (i.e. computers, radio, clocks) , as well as a recurrent motif in many biological systems (i.e.circadian rhythm, menstrual cycle).
*We intend to build a '''generic''' and '''modular synthetic biological oscillator''' that can become a fundamental building block in future synthetic biological applications.
*Previous oscillators have been attempted (such as the [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v403/n6767/abs/403335a0.html  Repressilator] by Elowitz and Leibler in 2000) but they often share the following problems:
::*'''Noisy''' and '''Unstable''' (due to stochastic molecular events at the single cell level, cell-cell variability, cell division)
::*'''Damping''' (i.e.with cell-cell asynchrony)
::*'''Inflexible''' (i.e. lack of control over amplitude and frequency)
::*'''No easy connectivity''' (hard to integrate into larger systems)

*Based on these past limitations, we have defined the''' specifications for our oscillator'''.

==Open issues==
*In electronic, the stability of the oscillations is a key factor, but the profile of the ouput signal is also an important property of an oscillator. There is an important variety of output profiles used in electronic (harmonic, square-wave, triangle-wave). Sometimes, for a given application a given profile is required.

*Due to biological variability, getting a stable behavior might be challenging.
