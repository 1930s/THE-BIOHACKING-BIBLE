This media, described by [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=2190215 Headley and Payne] is formulated to contain ion concentrations similar to eukaryotic cells.  Thus, gene expression is frequently quite different in this medium compared to media like L.  For example, the <i>spv</i> operon of <i>Salmonella</i> is expressed in exponential phase in this media, while it is repressed in exponential phase in L ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=9695915&ordinalpos=1&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum Wilson <i>et al.</i> 1997]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=9695915&ordinalpos=1&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum Wilson and Gulig 1998])

To make the base of the media media, combine the following in ~800 mL of H<sub>2</sub>O:

 34.23g K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>-3H<sub>2</sub>O
 2.72g KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O
 0.12g MgSO<sub>4</sub>-7H<sub>2</sub>O
 1.05g K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
 0.27g NH<sub>4</sub>Cl
 0.29g NaCl
 and 2&mu;L of 0.5M CaCl<sub>2</sub>

add H<sub>2</sub>O to a final volume of 1L and autoclave.

To use the media, add a carbon source, supplements and antibioics as required.

 The origional paper uses 0.4% glucose, which I typically use as well.  

That paper also adds nicotic acid, which is required for Shigella growth.  I omit this when working with Salmonella.  However, SL1344 and its derivitives are <i>hisG</i>, so histidine needs to be supplemented to a final concentration of 0.5 uM.

 So add: 2.5 &mu;L of a 200 mM stock of histidine per mL of media.
