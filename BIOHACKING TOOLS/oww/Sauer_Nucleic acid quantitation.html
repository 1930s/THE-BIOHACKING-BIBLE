See a discussion of the use of the words quantification and quantitation on the "Discussion" page.

Ambion has a good site that gives a variety of parameters for nucleotides and nucleic acids [http://www.ambion.com/techlib/append/na_mw_tables.html].

===Intro===
Lot's of ways.  I like the spec.


===Measuring nucleic acid concentration in a spectrophotometer===

Pipette your nucleic acid sample into a cuvette and record an absorbance scan from 240-340 nm.

Most calculations are done from the Abs at 260 nm.

====DNA====

Divide the absorbance at 260 nm by 0.02 for dsDNA or 0.027 for ssDNA.  This is the "concentration" in &mu;g/mL.  Actually, to get concentration, you have to know the length of your molecule and use the mass/volume to calculate a concentration.

===RNA===

ss RNA, Divide by 0.025.  There is no good way of calculating a value for folded RNA so see the next entry.  You'll notice that the peak of absorbance for RNA is left of 260, this is normal.

===Making your own RNA Extinction coefficients===

I couldn't find extinction coefficient for individual ribosomal subunits, so I did the following.

Use this reference for more info:  Cavaluzzi MJ, Borer PN. 2004.

I purified the subunits.  Then, I prepared several samples.  Each was diluted to the same extent in the final reaction.  One "Native" folded form that was in a translation buffer, one "dissociated" in Phosphate and EDTA, and one "hydrolysed" to get an accurate concentration measurement.

The hydrolyzed sample was prepared by incubating 5 &mu;L of ribosome with 20 &mu;L of 1.0 N NaOH for 1 hour at 37 degrees.  Then I neutralized the sample with 20 &mu;L of 1.0 N HCl.  I Added 1 mL of 100 mM NaH<sub>X</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> at pH 7.0 with 1 mM EDTA.  (this is the same pH used by Cavaluzzi and Borer).

Measure the absorbance of all three samples.  I did mine in triplicate and averaged the final values.

So, use the known extinction coefficients obtained by Cavaluzzi and Borer.  Use a word processor to determine the number of each nucleotide in your particular RNA and multiply by the extinction coefficient for that nucleotide.  Then sum the four values.  This will give a "formal" extinction coefficient for your RNA.  

Ext. Coeffs at 260;

pA = 15,020

pC = 7,070

pG = 12,808

pU = 9,660


Using the observed A<sub>260</sub> for your fully hydrolyzed RNA sample, determine the concentration of your RNA.

Now, with that known concentration and the measured A<sub>260</sub> of the native and unfolded samples, generate extinction coefficients for these conditions.  In the future, you won't have to hydrolyze the samples, just dilute them in a buffer an measure.

I calculated the following for E. coli ribosomal subunit RNAs:

<b>Hydrolyzed:</B>

23S = 33,386,832

16S = 17,588,970

5S  = 1,318,308

23S + 5S (large subunit) = 34,705,140

<b>In 100mM NaH<sub>X</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1 mM EDTA:</b>

50S = 25,457,162

30S = 13,646,276

70S = 39,103,438

<b>In 100 mM K<sup>+</sup>glutamate, 6 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM Tris-HEPES pH 7.8, 0.05% Tween-20, 14 mM mercaptoethanol</b>

50S = 27,058,100

30S = 13,394,967

70S = 40,453,067


I usually dilute a ribosome prep 1/500 to 1/1000 in PO<sub>4</sub> buffer and measure that because the tween and meercaptoethanol absorb like crazy and make variable baselines.
