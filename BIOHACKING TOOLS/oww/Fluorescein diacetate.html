*fluorescein (494/518) is formed by intracellular hydrolysis of FDA
*bacteria can hydrolyze this
*leaks from cells
*fluorescein has a relatively high rate of photobleaching
*pH-sensitive fluorescence ref (pKa ~6.4) that is significantly reduced below pH 7 
*relatively broad fluorescence emission spectrum (not good for multicolor use)
