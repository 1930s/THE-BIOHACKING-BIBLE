==Background/Introduction==
Systems biology reconstructs biological phenomena in order to develop
explanatory models of living systems. These models are represented
precisely in terms of mathematical expressions.  However, the meaning
of a model usually is not formally specified but only described in
natural language. This is something which hampers the development of
computer-aided modelling in systems biology. Here, we discuss a
framework for specifying the meaning of bio-models. We show that
semantics appears on different levels: the meaning of the model as a
whole, the meaning of the model's components, and the meaning of the
model's behaviour. Each level has an intrinsic and extrinsic facet. We
illustrate our framework by sketching what must be considered for a
formal semantics of two simple numerical models of the cell cycle.

==Results== 

===Conceptual Framework===

A bio-model can be seen as a binary relation between a formal
(mathematical or computational) expression and the modelled biological
reality.  This introduces two sides of the meaning of the bio-model:
The mathematical expression bears meaning by itself without referring
to the biological reality. It can be interpreted, analysed, and used
in computational simulations without knowing what it represents. We
call this side the intrinsic meaning of the bio-model. However, a
bio-model is more than a pure syntactical formal expression: it
describes a piece of biological reality and thereby also exhibits an
extrinsic meaning.  For both meaning sides of a bio-model three
pragmatic meaning levels can be identified: (1) The meaning regarding
the model as a whole accounts for its intention. (2) The meaning
regarding the components of the model accounts for its structure. (3)
The meaning regarding the dynamics of the model accounts for its
behaviour. The extrinsic/intrinsic sides of the three levels together
form the six '''meaning facets'''. The meaning facets are views at the
meaning of a bio-model from different perspectives. We claim that a
formal semantics of a bio-model has to incorporate all of these
meaning facets and the relations between them.

In order to make the notion of the meaning facets of bio-models more
concrete [[#tab:questions|Table 1]] shows typical questions for each of the meaning facets. The answers to these questions have to be formalised in order to arrive
at a semantic description of a bio-model.

===Case Study===

In order to illustrate the conceptual framework of the meaning facets
we sketch the meaning of two cell cycle models by Tyson
<cite>tyson91</cite>:

[[Image:models.jpg|center|frame|Equations from <cite>tyson91</cite>, for details see [[BioSysBio:abstracts/2007/Christian Knuepfer/Model explanation|Explanation of the Models]] ]]

The following table shows the BioModels <cite>novere06</cite> entry
for Tyson's cell cycle model (<i>Model 1</i>) after it has been
extended according to our meanings facets (emphasised in green). In <cite>knuepfer07</cite> we show how the meaning of both Tyson
bio-models can be formalised.

==Conclusion==

The meaning facets suggested here can serve as a guideline to arrive
at reasonable formal semantics of bio-models. We illustrate this using
Tyson's cell cycle models. Our meaning facets can be seen as a
methodological commitment that should be followed when modelling
biological processes. They offer a set of criteria for systematically
constructing bio-models and for reconstructing their meaning. Our
approach also addresses aspects of the meaning that existing
approaches did not, e.g. the meaning of behaviours and the meaning of
aggregated abstract model variables. This can be the basis for a new class
of knowledge-based modelling tools that helps the working biologist to
understand bio-systems.
