## Computer

# Shut off the Microscope (following the orders):
## lower the objective, rotate the objective inside
## take out the samples
## raise the objective again

#If you used oil objectives, please make sure to clean it. 
##	cotton swabs + 70% Alcohol
##	Lens Papers + Lens Cleaning Solution
##	Dry Lens Papers
#	Kohler Alignment
## 	Focus on the specimen using low magnification
##	Close Field Diaphragm
##	Adjust Condenser up and down until a sharp hexagon is observed
## 	Center the hexagon if needed with the two knobs
## 	open the diaphragm until the hexagon touches the field edge simultaneously.
#	Components to adjust for DIC images.
##	Polarizer (second ring filter on top)
##	DIC Prism in the Condenser (e.g. 100X Objective, should choose DIC III on LCD display)
##	Turn the prism under Objectives (Slide in to be functional).
##	Polarizer in the Motorized Diachroic (Analyzer, DIC).
#	To get a focus, use 10x objective first, focus, hit the “objectives” button to switch the objective to higher magnifications, fine adjust the focus to get a better view.
#	If using low voltage/intensity for Halogen Lamp and seeing yellow color, put the First ring filter in position to balance the color.
