==Welcome==
My name is Maureen Hoatlin, and I'm currently at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, Oregon. My lab joined  [[OpenWetWare]] in 2006.  We use OWW almost every day for our lab website, sharing our reagents and protocols, and organizing courses and seminars series.  You can [[Special:Emailuser/Hoatlinm|email me through OpenWetWare]] or contact me by:

==Research Interests==

We are interested in understanding how cells maintain genomic stability. One of the mechanisms that regulates this critical process is defective in Fanconi anemia (FA), a genetic model for human susceptibility to cancer. FA is a rare but devastating multi-gene disease thought to have an underlying defect in DNA interstrand crosslink repair.

Our lab pioneered the use of cell-free assays for FA proteins in extracts from Xenopus eggs.   These extracts allow analysis of FA protein function and post-translational modifications in a context that is permissive for naturally-regulated DNA synthesis. The recruitment of Fanconi proteins to chromatin in S-phase is providing us with a biochemical platform for elucidating the molecular function of the Fanconi proteins during the DNA damage response.
