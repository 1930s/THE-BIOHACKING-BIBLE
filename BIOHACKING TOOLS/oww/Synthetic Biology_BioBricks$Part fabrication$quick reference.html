The sequences below are intended to be used by people familiar with BioBricks construction for designing primers.

==Standard parts==

For those who already are familiar with constructing BioBricks parts, the sequences you need are included here for your copying pleasure.

 Copy and paste the following 30 bp sequence onto the 5' end of your upstream primer:
 5' ---> 3'
 GTT TCT TCG AAT TCG CGG CCG CTT CTA GAG

 Copy and paste the following 29 bp sequence onto the 5' end of your downstream primer:
 5' ---> 3'
 GTT TCT TCC TGC AGC GGC CGC TAC TAG TA

==Protein coding sequences==

For those who already are familiar with constructing BioBricks parts, the sequences you need are included here for your copying pleasure.

 Copy and paste the following 31 bp sequence onto the 5' end of your upstream primer for your coding sequence:
 note that this sequence shows the ATG start codon
 5' ---> 3'
 GTT TCT TCG AAT TCG CGG CCG CTT CTA G [ATG...
                                        start codon

 Copy and paste the following 35 bp sequence onto the 5' end of your downstream primer for your coding sequence:
 note that this sequence shows the TAATAA double stop codon!
 5' ---> 3'
 GTT TCT TCC TGC AGC GGC CGC TAC TAG TA [T TAT TA...
                                         double stop codon
