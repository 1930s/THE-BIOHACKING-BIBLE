We are located in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering administered jointly between Georgia Tech and Emory University School of Medicine. The lab is on the Georgia Tech campus in the Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience.

The lab research focuses on understanding at a systemic level how oxidative stress - induced internally by receptor-initiated ROS generation or by extracellular environment - leads to rapid but transient changes in signal transduction proteins through thiol modifications. Our lab relies on a strong synergy between computational and experimental work. We use computational modeling techniques to study how signaling networks may be regulated by changes in protein activities due to thiol modifications arising from intra- or extracellularly produced reactive oxygen species. Experimentally, we are developing novel high-throughput biochemical assays to detect and quantify the glutathionylation of proteins.
