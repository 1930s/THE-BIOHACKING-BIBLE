==Education==

*Ph.D. candidate in [http://web.mit.edu/be Biological Engineering] at [http://web.mit.edu MIT]. My thesis supervisor is [http://mit.edu/tidor/ Bruce Tidor].
*B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering, [http://www.upenn.edu/ University of Pennsylvania], 2002.
*B.A. in Biology with a concentration in Computational Biology, University of Pennsylvania, 2002.

==Research==

My graduate research is in the area of computational methods for structure-based molecular design.

I work on development and application of computational methods for structure-based molecular design and analysis. Specifically, I use protein sequence and structure search methods to study molecular diversity and accelerated evolution techniques, I have used information theory to analyze multiple sequence alignments, and I have used electrostatic calculations to study proteins and small molecules.

==Teaching==

*[http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Biological-Engineering/20-320Spring-2006/CourseHome/index.htm Biological Kinetics and Cellular Dynamics]. In the Spring of 2006 I was an instructor for this undergraduate course taught by professors Douglas Lauffenburger and Forest White. I taught students to use MATLAB to numerically solve systems of ordinary differential equations and to do curve fitting and parameter estimation.  

*[http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Biological-Engineering/20-011JSpring-2004/CourseHome/index.htm Statistical Thermodynamics of Biomolecular Systems]. In the Spring of 2004 I taught recitations as a teaching assistant for this course taught by professors Linda Griffith and Kim Hamad-Schifferli. I also created interactive computer simulations and wrote problem sets for this new undergraduate course.

*[http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cse381/ Operating Systems laboratory course, University of Pennsylvania].  In the Fall of 2001 another undergraduate and I ran this semester-long laboratory course project to design and implement a UNIX-like operating system.

*For one month in the summer of 2001 I helped teach a computer-networking course at the University of Science and Technology in Kumasi, Ghana through the Technology for Education Program.

==Other research==

*In the summer of 2004 I did an internship at the [http://www.pfizerrtc.com/ Pfizer Research Technology Center], working with Dr. Alan Cheng in the Molecular Informatics group.  We studied the Neuraminidase active site and its interaction with several therapeutic drugs and published a paper showing that charge optimization techniques can aid in lead-optimization of drugs for this influenza virus enzyme.

*I did undergraduate research in Professor Michael Klein's lab: the [http://www.cmm.upenn.edu/ Center for Molecular Modeling] at the University of Pennsylvania. As part of my work I coded and parallelized the Fast Multipole Method algorithm for molecular dynamics simulations and learned about molecular dynamics algorithms. 

*In the summer of 2001 I worked in the Computational Biology research group at the [http://www.almaden.ibm.com/ IBM Almaden Research Center].  Mentored by Dr. William Swope, Dr. Julia Rice, and Dr. Jed Pitera I studied TIP and SPC water models by analyzing molecular dynamics simulations. I wrote scripts to test various properties of water models such as density and enthalpy of vaporization as well as hydrogen-bond kinetics. I also implemented a parallelized replica-exchange method (using Metropolis scheme) for molecular dynamics.
