==Colony PCR==
*Yet again, yesterday's PCR seems to have evaporated...
**Trying again with a different tube.

==E0240==
*Made glycerol stocks of colonies 3,4,6 and mini-prepping the remaining 4mL.
**Will send for sequencing today.
*Sequencing order: 3F, 3R, 4F, 4R, 6F, 6R

==I2057==
*Sequence matches!

==T9002==
*Starting sequential digest (MfeI, then NsiI).

==Primers==
*Need scarring primers for I2056, I2057
**I2056:
***F: Same as I2055
***R: same as I2055

**I2057:
***F: CTTAGTAG CAATTG TCACACAGGAAAGTACTAGATGGC (52.1)
***R: same as I2055
