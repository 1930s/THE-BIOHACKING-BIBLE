===Generic Components===
*'''RBS (Elowitz)'''
[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_B0034 BBa_B0034]

Short description: This is the most efficient RBS in the registry, and sets the 1.0 efficiency standard. It is based on the Elowitz repressilator.


*'''Double terminator (B0010-B0012)'''
[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_B0015 BBa_B0015]

Short description: Double terminator consisting of BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012. This is the most commonly used terminator. It seems to be reliable.<br>
-forward_efficiency: 0.984  <br>
-reverse_efficiency: 0.295<br>

==Other Materials==
