== Overview ==
Create long DNA fragments from short ones.

== Procedure ==
* PCR amplify the necessary fragments, using proofreading polymerase enzyme. They should have about 15-25 bp overlaps. Use oligo Tm calculators to figure out their annealing temp.
* Clean up or gel extract the correct size band.
* Use cleaned up fragments as "template". Unlike normal PCR, about 1/2 to 3/4 volume of the extension reaction should be template.
* Use proofreading enzyme for extension. Do not use phusion. Try Pfu Turbo.
* Run 10-15 PCR cycles ''without'' end primers. (Template extension step)
* Add end primers, then continue cycling for another 15-20 rounds.
* Gel extract the correct fragment.
* Clone into a T-vector, or TOPO clone.
