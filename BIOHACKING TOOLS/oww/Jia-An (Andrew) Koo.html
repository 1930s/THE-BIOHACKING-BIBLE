=My life=

==Taipei, Taiwan (1984-2002)==
* I grew up in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei Taipei], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan Taiwan], a big city on an island in East Asia. I went through a standard Chinese education, attending the public school system from elementary school to high school.

==Chien-Kuo Senior High School (1999-2002)==
* I developed my interest in science at [http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8F%B0%E5%8C%97%E5%B8%82%E7%AB%8B%E5%BB%BA%E5%9C%8B%E9%AB%98%E7%B4%9A%E4%B8%AD%E5%AD%B8 my high school]. I received strong scientific training over that time which equipped me to win awards in both mathematics and biology competition for Taiwanese high school students. 

==Washington University in St. Louis (2002-2006)==
* After high school, I decided to study abroad at [http://www.wustl.edu WashU] for a life of adventure. I was majoring in biochemistry and molecular Biology. I entered [http://www.biology.wustl.edu/faculty/FacultyPage.php?IDProf=41 Kohl's lab] in summer, 2003 and was working on [http://www.nslc.wustl.edu/Research/HHMI/04fellows/koo.html the channeling project]

==Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2006-?)==
* I am now a [http://www.openwetware.org/wiki/BE_Board:Directory/2006_List first year graduate student] in [http://web.mit.edu/be/ Biological Engineering Division] at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology MIT]. I am still thinking about the thesis for my grad-school research.
