{{DH comment|label=2|comment=You're data and results need errors (and perhaps notes on where those errors came from.  Also it might be good to have more information about the lab: motivation, setup, etc}}
The first day of the experiment the equipment was not operating according to the lab manual, and therefore we spent the day troubleshooting the CRT and voltage supplies.

Here is a link to a diagram of the CRT

A write-up of the initial troubleshooting methodology: [[Physics307L:People/Gleicher/Notebook/070910]]



After Bill Miller discovered that an extra voltage was required on the CRT (5-12 Volts in parallel with heater voltage), we proceeded to take data [[Physics307L:People/Gleicher/Notebook/070917]].

Using Bragg's Law:  2*a*sin*<math>theta</math>=m*<math>lambda</math>

Here is a link to the Excel sheet with my calculations

The values I calculated averaged to 1.99E-10 and 1.15E-10.
