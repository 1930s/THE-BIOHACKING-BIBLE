# Brief summary of what you did (linking to the lab manual page is OK)
# Add links to all wiki pages that contain your notebook entries.  This is likely only one page.
# Report your value for the fall time using AC coupling.
  The Fall time that I found using AC coupling was t~=52 ms
#* Include error bars!
#* Explain how you measured this (briefly)
  I measured the fall time using the coursor function on the oscillscope. The measure function 
  can be used also but I found it more difficult to use. With the coursor I selected to read 
  off Ch2 and it gives to 'coursors' and using one to measure the max voltage of the signal and
  then use the other to find 10% of that voltage and see where the decaying portion  
  intersected the coursor line. Then I counted the divisions between the edge of the falling/
  decaying graph and where it intersected that second coursor. That was the fall time.
  
# What did you learn?
  I learned how to calculate frequency from the period, or at least it became more clear how to
  do so.
#* It's OK if you didn't learn anything.  But include things you are still confusing.
# What did you explore outside of the standard lab procedure?  Anything interesting?
  I did not explore anything outside of the standard lab procedure due to time constraints.
# What could make the lab better next year?
  Possibly more time to play with the oscillscopes and understand how they opperate more.
