==Important Update==
====Transition to Single Column System====
As of August 14, 2007 the HPLC is set up as a '''single column system''' to accomodate backflushing procedures for the Aminex column.  This means that only one column can be installed at a time.  The column connectors and flow direction are marked on the HPLC tubing.

With this new system configuration, '''ALL''' users will need to modify their methods as follows:
*Reconfigure the column/thermostat to 'Backflushing off' rather than simply 'Column 1' or 'Column 2'
*Set the thermostat for both sides of the heating block if your column straddles both of them.
*The new plumbing may cause the retention times of your peaks to shift, so you may want to consider constructing a new calibration curve
====Aminex Column Updates====
*The method AMINEXBACKFLUSH.M can be used to automatically backflush the column
**When running supernatants or samples containing salts using this method, run a blank every 10-15 samples
**The method's run time is 45 min
**This method should allow users to run > 15 samples without loss of resolution or the need to perform a manual backflush
*A guard column has been purchased specifically for the Aminex column
**Please use the guard to protect the analytical column and extend its life
**Install and remove the guard column and analytical column as a single unit

====Column Installation & Storage Notes====
Now that the HPLC is a single column system, it is important to be aware of what mobile phase is in the system before starting your analysis.  Here are some guidelines that will help protect the integrity of the columns and your data.
*Before installing your column, flush the entire HPLC system with water with no column installed to remove the previous user's mobile phase
*When removing another user's column always cap the ends to prevent drying and store it in its original box
*If your column requires special storage conditions it is your responsibility to flush it with the appropriate storage buffer and remove it from the HPLC at the end of your reservation

==Maintenance Log==
'''10Aug2007:'''  
Both pump seals (Agilent part# 5063-6589) were replaced after a steady leak from the pump head was detected.  The seal wear-in procedure was followed, however instead of pumping isopropanol at 350 bar, a lower pressure of ~50-100 bar was used due to leaky fittings.

'''11Aug2007:'''  
Aminex column was cleaned and regenerated according to the manufacturers protocols.

'''05Sept2007:'''
Replaced deuterium lamp (Agilent part# 5181-1530) for UV detection using Diode Array Detector.

==Reserving Time on the HPLC==
The HPLC in the Prather Lab is currently in high demand.  We've set up an electronic calendar to ensure that everyone has enough time to use the instrument.  The calendar is managed through Google calendar, and you can access the calendar to reserve the HPLC ahead of time by following the steps below:
