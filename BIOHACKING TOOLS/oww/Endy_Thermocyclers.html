*This thermocycler can be used to set up a temperature gradient across the plate.  Choose the gradient step when coding a protocol.  The lower temperature is at the left end and the higher temperature at the right.  The temperature is not linear across the block.  See the gradient calculator function under the list menu to calculate the temperature for each column of the block.
