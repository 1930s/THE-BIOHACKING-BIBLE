==Lunchtime meeting, 8/17==

Harvard 2007 iGEM Jamboree Presentation Planning Meeting 1, 8/17
<br><br>
<b><u>Content</u>
<br><br>
Introduction</b>
*How cells physically interact with environment? 
*Underutilized aspects of iGEM: random libraries, surface expression
*Figure of overall project: "Harvard iGEM 2007"; overall fusion of project
<Br>
<b>Targeting </b>
*Random library
*Loop/terminal
*Targets
**Nickel
**Calmodulin
**EGF
**GST
**His
**Strep
**PDZ
*Figures: Plates: before and after enrichment, somehow present numbers (pie chart? bar graph?), microscopy images with beads and fluorescent cells accumulating
<Br>
<b>Cell-cell signaling</b>
*QS – sender, receiver = biobricks, back to initial idea: target + QS, with figures
*Figures: drop experiment (halo)
<br><br>
<B>Intracellular signaling</b>
*Advantage of Fec system = gene expression with low level of background – need specificity with targets, etc, regulation on cell level rather than on population level
*Figures: 3d structure, where and why we chose to alter loop region
<br><Br>
<B>Conclusion</b>
*“Big goals” – medical applications
*Self-regulated production of certain proteins – “preprogrammed assembly”
*Constructs / futures
