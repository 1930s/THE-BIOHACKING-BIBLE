Our policy is to give credit where it is due. It is important both for a correct scientific attribution of the works and for the authors' fame.

For that purpose, we encourage authors to create a "Credits" section at the bottom of each page, after the list of external references. This section would typically say would did what and should be used by other publications that reference the article.

Inserting <nowiki>{{credits}}</nowiki> on a wiki page inserts a template for a "Credits" section, with a uniform style on all pages. To edit the style of the template and therefore propagate it to all pages that use it, go to [[Template:Credits]].
