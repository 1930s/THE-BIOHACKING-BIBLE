'''General Points'''
*If you want to get your message through, you should state it loud and clear in the beginning, and repeat it at the end.
*The best approach, however, is to divide your presentation in several parts, each ended by an intermediate conclusion
*Remember that a scientific presentation is not a detective story which is solved in the last moment.
*You might have tested two or three closely related hypotheses, but they should all revolve around the same single point.

Remember
*The faculty work on unrelated projects all week, so they need a refresher on the general scientific challenges you are facing.  Detailed information can and should follow, but first lay out the underlying scientific generally before delving into the details.
*If you can't think of any broad scientific questions that underly the previous week's work, you probably should go back and rethink what you're doing.  It's easy to start following a schedule/protocol and then forget the big picture.
