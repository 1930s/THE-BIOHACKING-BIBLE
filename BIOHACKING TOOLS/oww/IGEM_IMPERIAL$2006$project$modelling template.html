=General Template for the Analysis of a Dynamic System=

==1  Generalities==
* 1.1  Introduce some background about your model
** References
** Application
** Relevance of the Model for your Project?
** Basic Assumptions of the Model

* 1.2  Describe the goals of your study



==2  Model description==
* 2.1 Write down the set of ODEs characterizing your model
* 2.2 Describe in a table the signification of each term and parameter of the model 
** Use simple terms
** Give Physical Interpretation when possible
* 2.3 Define strengths and flaws of the model
** Insist on physical interpretation
** Look into relevance of model for small numbers

==3  Stability analysis==
* 3.1 Studying the steady points
**What is a steady point?
**What is the property of the system at these particular points ?
**Write down the set of ODEs to solve to find them
**Write down their expression.
**Any remarks on them ?

* 3.2 Studying the stability of the steady points
**What is the meaning of this study ?
**Why do we use the Jacobian ?
**Why do we use its Eigenvalues?
**What is the rule for stability? 
**Analyse each steady point
***by writing the value of the Jacobian at this particular point
***by writing the trace and determinant of the 2D matrix
***by writing down the eigen values
***Conclude on the stability of the point considered in regards to the parameters

* 3.3 Studying the Vector Field (VF)
**What is the Vector Field?
**Depending of the value of the parameters, define different cases (different behaviours of the steady points)
***for each case, draw the VF and place the steady points with the behaviour of the flow at their vecinity
***Plot in the VF, dx/dt=0 and dy/dt=0. By using the sign the dx/dt and dy/dt, draw the general trend of the VF in each region of the VF.
***Simulate the VF for a few well chosen values of your parameters, justify choice.
***Plot Different trajectories for wel chosen initial values

* 3.4 General Remarks on the VF
**Give as thorough as possible an analysis of the VF 
**In particular Focus on
***Shape of Trajectories
***Influence of initial conditions
***Influence of model parameters
**Make predictions and suggestions regarding the sensitivity analysis
***NB: Quting Poincare-Bendixson is a bonus for a 2D model....
