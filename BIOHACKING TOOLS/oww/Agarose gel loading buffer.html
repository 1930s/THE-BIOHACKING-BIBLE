[[Loading dye]] is mixed with DNA samples for use in agarose gel electrophoresis.  It generally contains a dye to assess how "fast" your gel is running and a reagent to render your samples denser than the running buffer (so that the samples sink in the well).

==Recipes for loading buffers==
The precise amount of dye is not important. However, it is crucial that you prevent overlay of dye and expected DNA size. For example, if you are expecting a genotyping band of 200-400nt, you shouldn't use bromophenol blue since it  will obscure your product. In this case, you should use a larger dye like xylene cyanol. 

===Ficoll & Orange G (6x) ===
* 1.5g Ficoll 400
* Orange G dye
* dH<sub>2</sub>O to 10mL

Add very small amounts of Orange G dye such that the loading dye is dark orange.  Store in small aliquots at 4&deg;C (room temperature is okay too). To use, add and mix 1/5th volume of loading dye to DNA solutions prior to loading into the wells of gels.

===Sucrose & xylene cyanol / bromophenol blue (6x) ===
* 4g sucrose
* 25mg bromophenol blue or xylene cyanol (0.25%)
* dH<sub>2</sub>O to 10mL 

Add appropriate amount to DNA sample, e.g. 5µl to 25µl.

Store at 4°C to avoid mould growing in the sucrose. 10mL of loading buffer will last for years.

===Glycerol & bromophenol blue (6x) ===
* 3ml glycerol (30%)
* 25mg bromophenol blue (0.25%)
* dH<sub>2</sub>O to 10mL
