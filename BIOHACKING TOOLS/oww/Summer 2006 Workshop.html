Watch this page for updates and tutorials about bioinformatics tools as researched by the [[MIBLab]] members.


==Workshop Goals==
In an effort to explore the state of the technology already available in bioinformatics, the BioMIB Lab team members have tried and tested a variety of existing tools for usability. The tools were selected based upon their relevance to the research currently in developement in the [[MIBLab]]. The tools were frankly critiqued based upon their design, features, ease of use and clarity for non-technical users. By dividing up these tools among the lab members and then presenting our findings, we hoped to impart on our entire team a condensed learning experience. Successes and downfalls of these tools were explored without every individual lab member taking the time to find, download, learn and sample each tool.

We present the results of our workshop here for others to review as a guide to these tools. Perhaps you will be able to more rapidly identify a tool that is of interest to you and to preview its style and usability. We hope that you benefit from our efforts and have the opportunity to more thoroughly appreciate the strong and varied tools that are available among the entire community of bioinformatics researchers.

Our inspiration for this workshop was derived from the efforts of the [http://www.cancer.gov/ NCI] and their devotion to open and integrated cancer research to speed us all towards the ultimate goal- a cure. We recommend visiting their website and learning more about the [https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/ caBIG protocols].

We highly recommend you listen to the [[Media:Carmona.ram|words of Surgeon General, Dr. Richard Carmona]], the keynote speaker at the spring 2006 caBIG Conference. We found it so inspiring that it was played at the start of our summer workshop to remind us all what we are striving for.

==Bioinformatics Tools==

===Databases===
The ability to access, quickly and easily, the vast amount of clinical data already available can speed research and lower cost.

===Analysis===
A variety of pre-existing algorithmic data processors can be invaluable to clinicians attempting to interpret results.

::[[GenePattern]]
::[[Gist]]
::[[Tmm]] - Gene coexpression

===Imaging===
A picture is still worth a thousand words. The ability to create and interact with visual representations of experimental results can ease understanding.
