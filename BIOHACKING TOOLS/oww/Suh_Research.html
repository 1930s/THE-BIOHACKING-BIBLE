Delivery of genes to target cells in specific tissues, or Gene Therapy, has the potential to 
prevent, treat, or even reverse disorders ranging from cancer to HIV/AIDS. Gene Therapy 
also has many potential applications in Tissue Engineering/Regenerative Medicine 
where the controlled differentiation of stem cells may be necessary to obtain highly 
organized tissue structures.


Gene Therapy is inherently dependent on Gene Delivery, the way in which the genes are 
ultimately transported to the nucleus of target cells. Complex biological environments, 
such as the extracellular environment and the cell cytoplasm, may pose significant 
barriers to efficient therapeutic gene delivery.


Synthetic polymer-based gene delivering nanotherapeutics have several advantages 
over viral systems, such as less immunogenicity and ability to carry larger cargo DNA; 
however, they suffer from significantly lower gene delivery efficiencies and often transfect 
cells nonspecifically. In addition, the nanoscale features of nonviral gene delivery 
systems are often difficult to control. Virus-based therapeutics, on the other hand, have 
highly defined structures that can be manipulated very specifically through genetic 
engineering.


To overcome the significant hurdles to efficient design and delivery of nanotherapeutics, 
our research interests are threefold:

===Uncover===
Using quantitative fluorescence microscopy approaches, we seek to identify rate-limiting steps to the efficient delivery of nanotherapeutics. The biophysical interactions of nanodevices and the biological environment (e.g. blood, extracellular matrix, and cytoplasm) are being investigated.

===Build===
We strive to use a creative combination of synthetic chemistry and recombinant DNA technology to design novel nanodevices for the delivery of diagnostics and therapeutics. Our research is focused on interlacing the critical properties of viral vectors with those of nonviral vectors to engineer nanotherapeutics with high efficiency but minimal immunogenicity.

===Apply===
Our ultimate goal is to translate our nanotherapeutics research into the clinic by applying our platform technologies to clinically important diseases.  As Bioengineers at Rice University, we are dedicated to narrowing the gap between bench research and clinical reality.
