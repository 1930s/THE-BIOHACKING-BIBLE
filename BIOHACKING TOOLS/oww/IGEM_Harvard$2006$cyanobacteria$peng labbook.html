==Notebook==

Below are notes taken during meetings or during lab; they will be either in pdf or below depending on platform used. Let me know if you need a native OneNote copy instead.

===June 12th===

'''Morning'''
*[[Media:ZS_brainstorm.pdf | Notes from first meeting]] (pdf)

'''Afternoon'''
*Explained BioBricks Format
*Created 1% Agarose Gel
*Folding DNA nanostructures
*Transformation of R0010, E7104, E0241 into Top-10 Competent E. Coli

   R0010 - Lac operon promoter
   E7104 - T7 promoter + GFP
   E0241 - GFP

===June 13th===

'''Morning'''
*Brainstorming by presenting previous projects
*[[Past_project_notes]]

'''Afternoon'''
*TF's created a 1% Agarose gel which we ran our DNA scaffold samples on
**130V, 45m+, imaged afterwards
  DNA Scaffold types
     -both
     -scaffold only
     -oligos only
*Checked plating of transformant cells; no growth on control
*Grew transformant cells in liquid culture (5mL) overnight with 50uL ampicillin
*More brainstorming - Perry presented his domain swapping experiment, discussed DNA nanostructure box

===June 14th===

'''Morning'''
*DNA Miniprep of transformant colonies
**Out of 5mL of liquid culture, reserved 1mL for gylcerol+freeze and 4mL other
**pelleted E. coli for each sample
**followed QIAprep Miniprep Kit for Microcentrifuge directions
***Used warm dH20 for elution
***Put at 40C for ~2 min to evaporate ethanol before elution
***Forgot to label after elution --> don't know what is what
****Sol'n: During digest will have to run PCR, can tell R0010 from rest, but E7104/E0241 is only different by 30bp; if doesn't work can flip and try two experiments.
***Nanodrop demonstration
 Nanodrop results
   -1: 31.2ng/uL 260/280:1.75 260/230:1.92
   -2: 38.5ng/uL 260/280:1.83 260/230:1.87
   -3: 33.8ng/uL 260/280:1.70 260/230:1.44

'''PROBLEM:''' Messed up labeling of the plasmids! To diagnose, ran a 15min e-Gel to find out which is R0010.

*Digestion of vector/insert
**Digested R0010 (200bp cutout) as vector at S and P site.
***.5uL Spe1, .5uL Pst1
*** 11uL h20
*** 2.5uL 10X BSA
*** 2.5uL #2 NebBuffer
*** 8uL DNA
**Digested other 2 (~900bp cutout) as insert at X and P site.
***.5uL Xba1, .5uL Pst1
*** 11uL h20
*** 2.5uL 10X BSA
*** 2.5uL #3 NebBuffer
*** 8uL DNA
**Incubate @ 37C for 1h
*Phosphatase
**80C@15min to kill enzyme activity
**Used CIP (1 unit) into the R0010, 1h@37C
*Run on 1% agarose gel
*Image, Cutout, and Purify
**Can isolate the three from the gel
