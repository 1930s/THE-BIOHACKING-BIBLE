===<font color="green">About</font>===
This is a kinetic assay for induction by HSL over a 107-magnitude concentration.  Each construct is measured in triplicate.  

===<font color="red">Media/Reagents/Materials</font>===
Plates that are needed: 3+X shaker/growing, X fluorescence, where 2X is number of time points desired.
*M9+0.1%YE+antibiotic plates
*210 mL M9+0.1%YE+antibiotic
*96 well growing plates
*96 well fluorescence plates
*96 well clear bottom absorbance plates

===<font color="orange">Pre</font>===
#Condition parts on M9+0.1%YE+antibiotic minimal media plates
#Inoculate 3 single colonies from these plates into M9+0.1%YE+antibiotic media overnight
#Autoclave 96 well shaker/growing plates
#Dilute cells down to OD600=0.1

#Do not put cells on ice!

For GFP, assay at 30ÂºC
