I received a Bachelor of science degree in Clinical Laboratory Science from King Saud University, College of Applied Medical Science, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Subsequently, I did a one year internship at King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh and I worked for six months in the clinical microbiology laboratory in the same hospital.  I was successful in obtaining a full scholarship from the Saudi Arabian government for my MSc and PhD degrees at the University of Manchester. My MSc was in Medical and Molecular Microbiology from the University of Manchester. In January 2007, I started my PhD under the supervision of Dr Philip Day and my project investigates hepatitis C pathogenesis in liver disease.

BPharm(Hons.) MRPharmS MSc

Background: Pharmacist

Undergraduate University: University of Malta

Previous postgraduate work / experiences: In 2005 I graduated from the University of Manchester with a Master’s degree in Immunology & Immunogenetics.
I have worked in Philip Day’ as research group during my Master’s project, and am now pursuing a PhD under his supervision. My main interest in this project is the possible utilization of microarray technology for perfecting RNAi therapy and drug development in neuroblastoma. I have also been appointed as honorary visiting lecturer in pharmacogenetics at the Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology at the University of Malta.

In 2002, whilst at school, during a one-month placement, I was inspired to do further studies in the area of molecular and cellular biology. I completed my BSc at the University of Manchester in Cell Biology in 2006 and am doing a Master’s degree in Immunology and Immunogenetics, at the University of Manchester. I am currently doing a 5-month project under the supervision of Dr Philip Day. The aim of my project is to devise a way of detecting RNA degradation by using multiplex PCR to determine whether there is a change of ratio in the different regions of a reference gene.
