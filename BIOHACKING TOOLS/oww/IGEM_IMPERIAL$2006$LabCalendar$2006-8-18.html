==Maxipreps==

*12D - for J37020 ligation
*5M - for ligating into aiiA construct when primers arrive
*J37016 - so a sample can be sent for sequencing

==Sequencing==
*J37016 sent for sequencing
**1 {{ug}} DNA
**12.5 pmol I13504 primer (CAA CTA GCA GAC CAT TAT C)

==Minipreps==
*J37015RS
**We have innoculated a 100 mL culture in the fridge to be maxipreped on Monday
**All cultures were successful; however, we took only colony 4 since it showed the best looking bands on the gel (yes, I guess we do have to be discriminatory)
*1M
**Band at around 2000 showing the plasmid, the part itself is too small and may have run too far, so we assume that it is correct
**This part can be maxipreped on Monday along with J37015RS
*4G
**Successful miniprep, we can start testing this on Monday as it is an entire part ready to be testing.  Please ensure that you culture in Kanamycin LB (located in fridge)
*2H 
**Unsuccessful, needs redoing
**Second miniprep unsuccessful. Have to let MIT know we have been struggling to ligate part 2H and that we suspect that it may involve a mutation in the Spe1 site.

==Ligations==
*J37031 = J37019 + B0015 (1I)
*J37032 = R0062 (9G) + I13504 (12D)
**12D on the gel after digestion was not clean, this might pose a small problem, but I cut out the smaller band anyway that look around 800 bp (compared to the J37019 which is also about 800 bp).  
*Electroporations this afternoon
