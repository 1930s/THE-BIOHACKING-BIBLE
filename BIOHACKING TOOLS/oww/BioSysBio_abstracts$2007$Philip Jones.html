==Background/Introduction==

The European Bioinformatics Institute [http://www.ebi.ac.uk EBI] is a centre for research and services in bioinformatics, operating as a non-profit academic organisation that forms part of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory [http://www.embl.org/ EMBL].  Part of the work of the EBI includes services for the proteomics community, through the work of the Proteomics Services Team.  The work of this team includes support for specific collaborative research efforts such as [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/transfog/ Transfog] and [http://www.enfin.org Enfin] together with the development, curation and maintenance of public data repositories for proteomics, including the [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact Intact] database of molecular interactions.  This presentation describes two resources that are made available from the Proteomics Services team, the [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride PRIDE] PRoteomics IDEntifications database and [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup OLS], the Ontology Lookup Service.

==Results==

The PRIDE PRoteomics IDEntifications database [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride PRIDE] is a centralized, standards compliant, public data repository for proteomics data. It has been developed to provide the proteomics community with a public repository for protein and peptide identifications together with the evidence supporting these identifications.  PRIDE currently implements the [http://psidev.sourceforge.net HUPO PSI] mzData schema (version 1.05) that captures mass spectra peak lists, analysis sample details and spectrometer settings.  PRIDE extends this schema with a data model designed to capture the output of search engines, including details of protein and peptide identifications and protein modifications that have been identified from MS.  The PRIDE development team are committed to implementing relevant standards from the [http://psidev.sourceforge.net HUPO Proteomics Standards Initiative] as they are ratified.  It is expected that the PSI analysisXML standard that is being designed to capture search engine output will replace much of the existing PRIDE-specific schema within the next twelve months.

The Ontology Lookup Service [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup OLS] is a spin-out project and dependency of PRIDE that provides a single point of query for over 40 controlled vocabularies and ontologies that are updated daily from their sources.  OLS provides interactive and programmatic interfaces for queries on term names, synonyms, relationships, annotations and database cross-references.

===OLS Screen Shots===
[[Image:Ols home page.jpg|thumb|left|This is the home page of [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup OLS].  This page makes use of [http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/AJAX AJAX] to create a rich user experience.  On this page the user can search for terms by typing parts of the search term, having selected the ontology that they are interested in.]]
[[Image:Ols successful search.jpg|thumb|left|Following a successful search, the user is presented with the details of the term from the ontology, including the definition, cross references and synonyms.]]
[[Image:Ols browse page.jpg|thumb|left|The OLS browse page allows the user to navigate through the hierarchy of the ontology from the root terms. A term may then be selected and the full DAG (directed acyclic graph) depicting the position of the term in the ontology is presented.]]

==Materials/Methods==
Both PRIDE and OLS are pure Java applications that are made available under the [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 Apache 2 Open Source Software Licence] and both can be obtained by clicking on the green 'Download PRIDE' icon on the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pride-proteome PRIDE Sourceforge project page].  Both applications include web applications for query, reporting and in the case of PRIDE, data submission.  These web applications are based upon the [http://struts.apache.org/ Struts framework].  

==Conclusion==

Both PRIDE and OLS will be presented, including the dependency of PRIDE upon OLS and the relationship between PRIDE and the HUPO Proteomics Standards Initiative.  Time and space permitting, future developments of the PRIDE user interface (especially developments of the query and reporting interfaces) will be described.
