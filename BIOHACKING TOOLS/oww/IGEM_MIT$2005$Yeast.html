*[http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.immunol.16.1.569 DIMERIZATION AS A REGULATORY MECHANISM IN SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION] at first glance this paper is not going to tell us a surface dimerizing pathway receptor in yeast. It is a thorough explanation of dimerization and its use in signalling, as the title would suggest, but the examples in the paper focus mostly on mammalian cells, which, for reasons only vague to me, we don't focus on.

[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=46831&blobtype=pdf Signal transduction via the MAP kinases: Proceed at your own RSK] maybe. i can't say this paper WON'T, so i'll read it again in a while. take it down if you rread it and its lame.
