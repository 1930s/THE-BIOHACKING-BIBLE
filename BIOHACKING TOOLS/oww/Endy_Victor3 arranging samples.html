*This is a very small but somewhat useful tip to make data-processing easier.  
*If you arrange your replicates along rows rather than down columns, then when you sort the results file by well, the replicates are listed in sequence.
*The exception to this rule is when injecting varying amounts of reagent into different wells as the injector software is constrained to dealing with replicates in series from left to right, top to bottom.
