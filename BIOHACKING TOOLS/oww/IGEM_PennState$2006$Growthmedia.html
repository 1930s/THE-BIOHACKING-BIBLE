<h1>Growth Media</h1>
<h2>LB</h2>
<h3>Media (per liter)</h3>
*10 g Bactotryptone
*5 g Yeast Extract
*10 g NaCl
*pH to 7.0 with NaOH/HCl
*Autoclave
<h4>Plates</h4>	
*Add 15 g Bacto-Agar per liter media
*Autoclave for 25 minutes
**If antibiotics necessary, add only once media has cooled to ~45ºC, or is comfortable to the touch
*Pour in sterile environment (~15ml per plate)
*Cool in such a way as to avoid accumulation of condensation, while maintaining sterility
*Seal with parafilm, place in bag, and store at 4ºC
