== Our Mission ==

To become the most dynamic and international network of young researchers in the broader disciplines of the field of Computational Biology. The Student Council (SC) continually thrives to provide opportunities for networking, career enhancement and skills development for those who aspire to become the next generation of Computational Biology Leaders.

If you are a new bird in the field, let me say that the SC is a platform which will open your career horizons, you will network with some of the brightest and most highly motivated students world wide, meet with some of top high-impact-factor researchers, and give a touch of distinction to your career development strategy!

== How to be part of the premier network in the field? ==

As always, we are also looking for new driven, highly motivated, ambitious students who aspire one day to become an SC Leader, or even the SC Chair. Parthi, our current chair joined the SC leadership last year, so time spent here is not a constraint to become a leader. And of course, please tell your student friends if you think they might be highly motivated to participate in the SC! 

 
The simplest way to become an SC leader is to help with one of the [[ISCB-SC:New Projects|New Projects]]. If you want to hear more about our current opportunities, or simply have fresh ideas that you would like us to work on, do not hesitate, just send an email now to manuel.corpas@gmail.com and we will attend your enquiry with pleasure. We sincerely wish you a year full of exciting discovery and scientific accomplishment, and I hope to meet you personally at any of the events the SC is organising during 2006.
