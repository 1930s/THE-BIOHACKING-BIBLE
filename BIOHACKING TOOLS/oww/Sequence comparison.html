Sequence Comparison is commonly used in molecular biology to analyze similarities and differences between DNA or polypeptide sequences, often by using sequence databases, comparison algorithms and computer workstations.  

With the advent of rapid sequencing technology, researchers can learn valuable functional information about a protein simply by comparing its sequence to other known sequences.  This also allows for comparison of homologous sequences to be find out information about common evolutionary descent, and to construct a phylogenetic tree.
