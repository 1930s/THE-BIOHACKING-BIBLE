#Team meeting: 1pm
#*assess weekend lab progress
#**Got 2 LCs of something that might be 400 in top10; miniprepping today, going to sequence
#**the "banana" cells (250 + (250+400)) from the sketchy colony grew up yellowish and weird colored...contamination 
#**The "mint" IK cells didn't smell so good...we're not sure why.  maybe something is wrong with our IK cells?  the transformed colonies weren't all big and spread out like IK normally are. we're miniprepping one of the LCs today.
#*check in with advisors about biobricked yeast vector options
