There have to more lists out there...any other ideas?

* [http://www.transcriptionfactor.org DBD] is a database of transcription factor predictions for all ENSEMBL-organisms and Genbank.
* But if you already know which factors you want to download, [http://www.biomart.org biomart] is probably more comprehensive
* [http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/genomes/FlyTF/ FlyTF] FlyTF is similar to DBD but is manually curated (Boris spent 500hrs on it) and therefore covers a lot more factors as DBD only has a coverage of 65% and does not contain text-book factors like bicoid. (sorry for the old, wrong description and thanks for the feedback!):
* Transfac has a wealth of information in its FACTORS.DAT table
