==Discussion==
Figure 1.1 and Figure 1.2. shows us that the synthesis of GFPmut3b increases with DNA added up until 4µg of DNA. Above this the number of molecules of GFPmut3b produced decreases. 

Another interesting observation is that the 6µg of DNA begins producing GFPmut3b greater than 2µg but then levels of before 2µg. This is thought to be because the data displayed on the figures are averages of 2 samples, one of the samples levels off sooner than the other and so brings the average down. However, the results do tell us that 6µg is lower than the 4µg, therefore the 4µg is the optimum DNA for our ''in vitro'' chassis.

This agrees with promegas guide on using the commcerial cell extract ''in vitro'' chassis. The guide states that 4µg is the maximum and above this there is problems with premature termination of translational products

==Conclusion==
To conclude the following approximations can be made:<br>
*Optimum DNA concentrations - 4µg of DNA
