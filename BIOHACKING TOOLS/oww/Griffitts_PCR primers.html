==Primer Design==
===General===
* Primers should generally be 20-22 nt long with 10-12 Gs and Cs
* Remember to use the reverse compliment for your reverse primer
===Sequencing===
* Design one forward primer for every ~500 bp
* You won't get good sequence where your primer sits, so design your first primer to be a little upstream from your sequence
* You only need one reverse primer
===Cloning===
* Check for restriction sites within your target before adding them to your primers
* Add a "CGC" to the ends of your primers
===Gene Deletion===
* Check for restriction sites within your target before adding them to your primers
* Add a "CGC" to the ends of your primers
* Clone ~500 bp upstream and downstream of the gene you're intending to delete and include ~20 bp of the target gene
* For your internal primers, give them 10-12 bp homology with each other for [[Griffitts:Overlap-extension PCR|Overlap-extension PCR]]
==Primer Hydration==
* Find the nmoles on the tube (e.g. 24.65 nmoles)
* Multiply by ten (e.g. 24.65 × 10 = 246.5)
* Take that number and add that many μL of [[Griffitts:Common_buffers#TE_buffer|TE buffer]] (e.g. add 240 to 250 μL)
* This will give you 100X primers
