===AM===
*George's paper presentation
*Observed multiple pink colonies of RFP-transformed (Z-competent) cells on agar plate.
*Observed pinkish broth that was left in shaker incubator overnight @ ~36.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C.  Unable to excite red fluorescence with standard long wave UV light (which is optimal for GFP excitation).
*Cryogenic freezing of transformed cells from broth (DH5alpha ''E. coli'')
*# 1 mL of glycerol
*# 1 mL of cell-containing broth
*# Filled cryogenic tube (2 mL total)
*# Vortexed at level 6 for ~ 6-10 secs
*Making broth from transformed Z-competent cells
*# 5 mL of LB broth
*# Added scraping of cells to broth (use sterilized wire-loop)
*# Vortexed at level 6 for ~6-10 secs
*# Incubated in shaker @ ~36.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C. 
===PM===
*Detailed research in photosignalling systems and other possible photoreceptors/ photosensors.
*(Next week's paper presentations will focus on photobiology of microorganisms)
