'''Procedure'''<br>

Prepare the cell sample from which RNA to be isolated<br>

''For monolayer cells:''<br>

1.	Rinse cell monolayer twice with ice-cold PBS, and the cells are scraped to a beaker containing ice cold PBS and transfer the mixture to a centrifuge tube<br>
2.	Centrifuge the solution at maximum speed for 15 sec in a microcentrifuge maintaining temperature at 4°C and collect the cells.<br>

''For Cell Grown in Suspension''<br>

1.	Harvests the cell by centrifugation in a table top centrifuge for 5-10 minutes at room temperature <br>
2.	Remove the medium and resuspend the cells in one-half original culture volume ice-cold PBS. Repeat the process<br>

'''The Process'''<br>

1.	Transfer the cell to micro centrifuge tube containing 400 µl ice cold Lysis buffer and place it on ice for 5 minutes.<br>
2.	Centrifuge the mixture in a microcentrifuge for 2 minutes at maximum speed.<br>
3.	Collect the supernatant in a clean tube and add 4 µl of 20% SDS to denature the protein part. Mix immediately by vortexing.<br>
4.	To digest the protein part, add 2.5 µl of 20 mg/ml proteinase K. Incubate 15 min at 37°C.<br>
5.	Add 400 µl of 25:24:1 phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, room temperature., mix thoroughly and collect in a centrifuge tube<br>
6.	The resultant mixture is centrifuged for 3 minutes in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed .Carefully remove the supernatant to a clean tube and repeat the step 5<br>
7.	Collect the aqueous upper phase to a clean tube and add 400 μl of 24:1 chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. Mix thoruogly by vortexing 15 to 30 sec<br>
8.	Centrifuge the mixture for 1 minute in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed, in room temperature and collect the upper phase into a clean tube<br>
9.	Add 1 ml of 95% ethanol and 40 µl of 3 M sodium acetate (DEPC-treated) to the RNA sample contained in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, invert to mix, and incubate in an ice-water bath for at least 10 minutes. Store the sample at -20°C overnight .<br>
10.	Centrifuge at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 15 min at 4°C, decant the supernatant, and drain inverted on a paper towel<br>
11.	Add 1 ml 80% ethanol /25% 0.1 M sodium acetate to the pellet and rinse the mixture.<br>
12.	Store at -20°C until needed.
