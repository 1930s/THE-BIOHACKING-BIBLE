== OUR PROJECT ==

                            
                           ==  BETTER FOOD AND BETTER DRINK ==
As everybody know, vitamin is a kind of quite important nutrition for human body and other kinds of animals. People need to absort many kinds of vitamins from outside. Some production processes of vitamins are very complicated and it always costs much for us to buy the artifical synthetical vitamins or other kinds of commodities contain vitamins in them. In our project, we use yeast as a host to produce different kinds of vitamins at the same time. Yeast is a widely used microorganism in lab and industry, especially in the food purduction industry. It is commonly used in food and drink production. We add the genes encoding the enzymes contributed to vitamin production to yeast cells to product these vitamins during fermation. By doing this, we can get beer or bread with vitamins in them. This idea reduces the cost of producing vitamin food and drink. At the mean time, it simplifies their production process largely.
