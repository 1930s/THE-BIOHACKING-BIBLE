==My Plans==

I will work with Cynthia on the project detailed below.

===Project===

Using data from the World Health Organization, we will get the following information about the diseases that we diagnose:

:* If the disease is curable
:* Treatments
:* Preventions

This will be done by searching WHO for the disease name and parsing the returned information regarding the disease.  

''For Tuesday April 17:'' we expect to have parsed the information from the WHO.

''Edit''

It looks like the WHO website does not really have information regarding [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs209/en/ genetic diseases].

I am currently searching for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_genetic_disorders genetic disorders] within WHO.

Looks like WHO may be a dead end.  I am currently looking at other websites that might provide treatment information for various genetic diseases - such as www.freemedsoftware.org.
