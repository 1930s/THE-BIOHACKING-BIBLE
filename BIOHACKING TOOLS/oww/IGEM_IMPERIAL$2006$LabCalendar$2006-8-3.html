==Start Ligations==
*Began stage 2 ligations
**(12D->24A)->6B
***F2620 (6B) - Vector (Cut with S & P, use orange buffer)
***C0261+I13504 (12D->24A) - Insert (Cut with X & P, use yellow buffer)
**(7A->3O)->9G
***R0062 (9G) - Vector (Cut with S & P, use orange buffer)
***B0034+C0062 (7A->3O) - Insert (Cut with X & P, use yellow buffer)
*Digests and gel running unsuccessful
*No DNA was evident on the gel, thought to have been caused by incorrect maxi-prep of parts
*Propose to re-maxiprep all parts that were maxi-preped yesterday on 4/8 Friday
*PCR was also unsuccessful due to maxi-preping issues yesterday

==PCR fusion Protein==
*Prepare on ice: Mix in a PCR tube the following:
**28.5 ul pure water
**5ul buffer (taq buffer containg sulphate)
**1ul of each primer
**10ul MgCl2 (from 25uM stock solution)
**2.5ul DNTP mix (10uM)
*Dilute 1ul of maxiprep DNA nto 50ul water. 
**Take 1ul of this solution and add to reaction mixture.
**Add 1ul of Taq Polymerase
*Total Volume should be 50ul.
*Program PCR machine
**94C for denaturation (1min)
**Work out melting temperature from primer composition according to formula below. Also found on label of primer tube.
***(2xA-T)plus(4xG-C)-5= Melting temperature.(1 min)
***Calculate for both primers and use the lower of the two.
**72C for extension (1min-1min 15 sec depending on template size. 1min for 1KB template).
*Run for 25 cycles
*Leave at 4C after cycles (program machine).
*Run DNA on gels to isolate.

==Annealing Oligos==

*Oligos come as dry powder.
*Resuspend in water (add 1ul water for every ug of powder)
*Caution: careful when adding water - powdered disc may float out!
:In a PCR tube:  
:*Add 5ul each of the two complementary oligos
:*Add 2ul of O-buffer (orange top)
:*Make up the rest of the solution to 20ul with water
:*Place epindorf in PCR machine for 2-3 mins at 94C
:*Switch off machine and allow to cool for ~1hr to room temperature (oligos should anneal)

*To add phosphates to the strands:
:*Mix 10ul of annealed oligos
:*2ul of 10 times Buffer A
:*1ul 10mM ATP
:*6ul dH20
:*1ul PNK
:* Leave in 37C waterbath for 30-60mins

==Set up Maxi-Prep for 4/8==
Cultured the following in 50 ug/mL Amp LB
*1I
*5M
*12D->24A colonies 1, 3, and 4
*16P
*7A->3O colony 2
*18I (electroporation successful)

==Part I13207 Testing==
*Made up 10% L-arabinose solution
**1 g into 1 mL MilliQ
*Made up 1M Zinc chloride solution
**1.363 g in 10 mL MilliQ
*Protocol underway
*Will be tested in 2 phases
**Part 1 testing: Same as T9002 testing, can be done in parallel
**Part 2 testing: To see on or off of AiiA with key parameters (arabinose, zinc chloride)

==To Do on Friday==
*Maxiprep - 8:30 am
**John C, Jimmy, Christin, Tom
*Ligations - 10:30 am (dependent upon Maxiprep finishing)
**John S, Jonny
*PCR - 10:30 am (dependent upon Maxiprep finishing)
**Deepti, Farah, Christin
*Gel - 10:30 am (overnight PCR and maxipreps to check)
**A few people who do maxiprep
