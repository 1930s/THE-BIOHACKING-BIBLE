'''Issues'''
</big>

'''Riboswitch'''

*Unable to tell if worked from PCR
*Will be sequenced (takes 2-3 days) ''waiting on result''

'''PCR'''

*The PCR results do not correlate with the miniprep results
*PCR for immunotag and lox part is not working

'''minipreps'''

*These are not conclusive for many parts, we are looking into using a restriction digest
