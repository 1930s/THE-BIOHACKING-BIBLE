''ISCB Student Council Newsletter #1, December 2005''


Dear Student Council Member!

Welcome to the very first ISCB Student Council Newsletter! The Student Council
Leadership has agreed that this is the best way to keep you updated about the
work of the Student Council. We plan to send out a quarterly newsletter in the
future and we hope that you will find this a useful resource.

As the end of the year is nearing, the Student Council Leadership is busy
planning activities for 2006. One of our goals is to increase our members'
involvement in those activities and we are taking several approaches to
accomplish this. Please take some time to read this newsletter. Find out about
our plans for the next year and how you can contribute to our efforts. We hope
this newsletter encourages you to actively participate in the development of
our organization!

Please send comments and questions about this newsletter to
newsletter@iscbsc.org. Thank you!

Your Student Council Newsletter Team

'''Project Groups'''

The Student Council leadership wants to include more Student Council members in
the planning and organization of our activities. Thus we have decided to
establish so-called "project groups".

Project groups will be formed to work on a specific project such as the
organization of our Student Council Symposium. A project group could also be
formed to evaluate the demographics of the Student Council members or to
develop a Student Council brochure and so on.

The groups will be made up of Student Council members that are interested in
contributing to our joint efforts. In addition, the project groups will include
members from one or more Student Council committees. We think that this is a
great opportunity for members that would like to contribute without a long-term
commitment and without having to take over a lot of responsibility.

A call for participation in a project group will be sent out by one of the
Student Council committees. That committee will also appoint a person who is in
charge of the project group. The person in charge will assign specific tasks to
project group members and report to the Student Council leadership on the
groups activities.

Tasks for project group members could include things such as reviews of Student
Council related conference proceedings, design and maintenance of webpages,
conference logistics, help with social activities, design of funding proposals
as well as search for funding agencies.

We hope that through participation in project groups Student Council members
will be encouraged to actively participate in our committees and in the Student
Council leadership.


'''Local Affiliated Groups'''

The Student Council Leadership would like to stimulate more activity at a local
level. We are planning to create links with existing student societies in
Computational Biology and encourage students to start new groups and projects
at a local level. Our goal is to better serve regional communities by offering
support for networking and educational events. We are currently working out the
details but we would like to hear from you.  If you are in a local student group
related to Computational Biology or are interested to start one, please write to
local@iscbsc.org.

'''Student Council Symposium 2006'''

We are currently in the early stages of planning the 2nd Student Council
Symposium. The feedback we have received through evaluation of the
questionnaires handed out during the last symposium in Madrid is a key
instrument to adjust our activities to the needs and expectations of the
student community. Please check our website frequently for updates on this!


'''ISMB 2006'''

The Student Council is going to organize activities for students at ISMB, which
will take place from August 6th through August 10th in Fortaleza, Brazil. More
information about our agenda will be included in the next newsletter and posted
on our website once confirmed.


'''BioSysBio and YBF 2007'''

Two European bioinformatics and systems biology meetings will come together in a
single meeting in the UK in early 2007 with the support of the ISCB Student
Council. The YBF (Young Bioinformatics Forum) and BioSysBio meetings will join
forces for a meeting designed to bring together interdisciplinary research in
systems biology, bioinformatics and synthetic biology.

A number of established faculty will be speaking, followed by the opportunity to
hear the latest research from up and coming students and postdocs in each field.
More information will be made available at http://www.BioSysBio.com and
http://www.YBF.org.



== Review of Past Activities ==


'''Student Council Symposium at ECCB 2005'''

The 1st Student Council Symposium was held on 28th of September immediately
preceding ECCB 2005 in Madrid.  We initiated the review process of student
abstracts and were pleasantly surprised by the quality and quantity of
abstracts submitted. We received over 60 abstracts in 7 different categories
covering a wide range of topics within computational biology.  From these we
selected 20 for  oral presentation on the symposium and another 36 for poster
presentations at ECCB.  For more information on the 1st International Student
Council Symposium in Computational Biology please visit
http://www.eccb05.org/student.htm.

We are pleased to announce that Anna Divoli from the University of Manchester
won the Best Student Presentation Award for her talk "BioQSpace: An interactive
visualisation tool for clustering MEDLINE abstracts" by popular vote. The award
was kindly sponsored by BMC Bioinformatics.

The Student Symposium was evaluated by means of a questionnaire that was handed
out to the approximately 120 participants. The Student Council Leadership is
extremely pleased with the outcome. Feel free to have a look at the
questionnaire and the evaluation on the Marketing Committee's website at
http://www.iscbsc.org/marketing.


'''BioSapiens Network of Excellence'''

At ECCB 2005 a meeting was organised to discuss the provision of Bioinformatics
courses within Europe. The idea is to create an online overview of courses
within Europe, which will help prospective students to make a choice. This
overview will be an extension of the currently available information on the
BioSapiens website, http://www.biosapiens.info/page.php?page=masters.

Representatives of the student council were invited to give a presentation at
this meeting about the current activities of the student council relating to
the provision of information to students. We were also able to make suggestions
for future developments of the resources.

Currently there exists a list for international Master's courses on the ISCB
website at http://iscb.org/univ_programs/program_board.php. One of our
proposals is to survey the ISCB Student Council to find out how helpful this
list is and what can be improved. For the purpose of BioSapiens, to begin with
we are primarily interested in the opinion of European students. An official
survey of student members of ISCB will be due soon, and we hope to take this on
as part of the survey.



'''Activities at ISMB 2005'''

At ISMB 2005 in Detroit the Student Council hosted several events especially for
students. For instance, there were one on one mentorship sessions with faculty
members and a panel discussion with several established researchers. The panel
discussion included talks on topics such as "Industrial Career Prospects in
Computational Biology" and "How to Write My Paper to Have It Published in a
Computational Biology Journal?". We also presented a poster about our website
and some of our long-term projects, such as the Project Pairing Program.

In addition to these activities, several Student Council leaders had the
opportunity to talk about the Student Council's progress and future goals with
members of the ISCB Board of Directors. The discussions were very fruitful and
motivated us in our efforts to build a student organization within the ISCB. To
maintain those important contacts we are regularly exchanging ideas and plans
with the ISCB leadership through our Student Council Representative to the
Board of Directors, Manuel Corpas.

Another positive aspect related to our ISMB 2005 activities was the Top
Performer Award. This award was a travel grant to attend ISMB and given to the
most active Student Council leader. This year's winner was Sarath Chandra
Janga, currently Vice Chair of the Student Council.
