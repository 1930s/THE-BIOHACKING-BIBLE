=Part <bbpart>S01656</bbpart> - IPTG induced AiiA production, test construct=

NB: This part has kanamycin resistance and must be grown in LB with 50 {{ug}}/mL Kanamycin

The purpose of this protocol is to test the ability of AiiA to degrade AHL.  This is the closest part to our actual testing construct, <bbpart>J37022</bbpart>, since it has the LVA degradation tag.  The addition of the FLAG tag to our actual construct may or may not affect the activity of AiiA, but the purpose of this experiment is just to qualitatively measure the activity of AiiA.  This protocol works in conjunction with <bbpart>T9002</bbpart> to measure the AHL concentration after a certain period of time.

==Equipment/Materials==
*Falcon tubes or similar
*Photospectrometer
*Gilson pipettes
*Eppendorf tubes
*Centrifuge
*Plain LB medium
*LB medium with 50 {{ug}}/mL Kanamycin
*LB medium with 50 {{ug}}/mL Ampicillin

==Protocol==

*First, grow two overnight cultures of part <bbpart>S01656</bbpart> in plasmid pSB2K3 (Kanamycin resistant) in 2 mL of LB with 50 {{ug}}/mL Kanamycin.  In one of the cultures, innoculate with 20 {{uL}} of 1M stock IPTG (to obtain a 1 mM concentration of IPTG).  The other culture will be our control with no IPTG.  Also, prepare a 2 mL overnight culture of <bbpart>T9002</bbpart> in LB with 50 {{ug}}/mL Ampicillin.  Keep the cultures in the 37째C shaker overnight. <font color=gray> (20 min + 8-12 hrs) </font> 
*In the morning, prewarm 20 mL LB with Kanamycin, 40 mL LB with Ampicillin, 20 mL plain LB medium in the 37C waterbath to prevent shock to the culture when diluting. 
*Remove the samples from the shaker and measure the OD of the cultures at 600 nm wavelength. <font color=gray> (5 min) </font> 

:OD of +IPTG = _________

:OD of -IPTG = _________

*Reculture both overnight cultures in 5 mL of prewarmed LB with Kanamycin by diluting to an OD of 0.1 by using the following formula <font color=gray> (5 min) </font> 
<center><amsmath>
\frac{0.1}{\mbox{OD of culture}} \times \mbox{5 mL}
</amsmath></center>

:Amount to dilute of +IPTG culture = ________ mL (amount of original culture to use)

:Amount of prewarmed LB with Kanamycin to use = ________ mL (5 mL - above result)

:Amount to dilute of -IPTG culture = ________ mL (amount of original culture to use)

:Amount of prewarmed LB with Kanamycin to use = ________ mL (5 mL - above result)

*Innoculate the culture with IPTG with another 50 {{uL}} of IPTG to ensure that AiiA production continues. <font color=gray> (5 min) </font> 
*Allow the reculture to grow for 2 hours by placing in the 37째C shaker.  During this time, we are allowing the cells that are in the stationary phase from the overnight culture to get into the exponential phase.  <font color=gray> (2 hrs) </font> 

:Time begin:  ____________________

*Meanwhile, reculture the overnight culture of <bbpart>T9002</bbpart> in 16 mL of prewarmed LB with Ampicillin by diluting to an OD of 0.1 by using the following formula <font color=gray> (5 min) </font> 
<center><amsmath>
\frac{0.1}{\mbox{OD of culture}} \times \mbox{16 mL}
</amsmath></center>

:OD of T9002 culture (1st Measurement):  _________

:Amount to dilute of T9002 culture = ________ mL (amount of original culture to use)

:Amount of prewarmed LB with Ampcilillin to use = ________ mL (16 mL - above result)

*Again take the OD of the two samples and dilute to an OD of 0.1.  This time, dilute into a 5 mL prewarmed LB (no antibiotic!).  Using kanamycin will kill the <bbpart>T9002</bbpart> cells since they are only resistant to ampicillin.  Before the LB is added, spin down the cells using the large centrifuge for 3 minutes at 3000 rpm and discard the supernatant.  Add in 5 mL LB (no antibiotic) and vortex to resuspend.  Use the following formula: <font color=gray> (10 min) </font> 
<center><amsmath>
\frac{0.1}{\mbox{OD of culture}} \times \mbox{5 mL}
</amsmath></center>

:OD of +IPTG culture = ________

:Amount to dilute of +IPTG culture = ________ mL (amount of original culture to use)

:OD of -IPTG culture = ________

:Amount to dilute of -IPTG culture = ________ mL (amount of original culture to use)

*Again, innoculate the culture with IPTG with another 50 {{uL}} of 1 M stock IPTG to ensure that AiiA prouction continues. <font color=gray> (5 min) </font> 
*Mix to ensure homogeneity of the IPTG by vortexing. <font color=gray> (1 min) </font> 
*Aliquot 1 mL of the +IPTG culture into 4 separate eppendorfs.  Three of them will contain AHL, and the other ependorf will be a control without AHL.  To the tubes needing AHL, add in '''10 {{uL}} of 100 {{uM}}''' stock solution to obtain a final concentration of 1 {{uM}}.<font color=gray> (2 min) </font>
*Aliquot 1 mL of the -IPTG into 4 separate eppendorfs.  Three of them will contain AHL, and the other will not have AHL.  These will act as our controls as well. To the tubes needing AHL, add in '''10 {{uL}} of 100 {{uM}}''' stock solution to obtain a final concentration of 1 {{uM}}.<font color=gray> (2 min) </font>
*Place all of the aliquots in the 37째C shaker for two hours to allow the AiiA enzyme to work. <font color=gray> (2 hrs) </font>

:Time begin:  ________________


*Just before the 2 hours are up, reculture again the <bbpart>T9002</bbpart> in 25 mL of prewarmed LB with Ampicillin by diluting to an OD of 0.1 by using the following formula <font color=gray> (5 min) </font> 
<center><amsmath>
\frac{0.1}{\mbox{OD of culture}} \times \mbox{20 mL}
</amsmath></center>

:OD of T9002 culture (2nd Measurement):  _________ 

:Amount to dilute of T9002 culture = ________ mL (amount of original culture to use)

:Amount of prewarmed LB with Ampcilillin to use = ________ mL (20 mL - above result)

*After two hours, spin all of the S01656 cultures in a centrifuge at 13k rpm for 20 seconds to remove the cells. The AHL and the IPTG will be in the supernatant, but the AiiA enzyme will be held within the cell.  <font color=gray> (1 min) </font> 
*Use the [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/Protocols/T9002|T9002 Protocol]] as the AHL assay as outlined below.

===<bbpart>T9002</bbpart> Protocol Section (slightly revised)===
*To start AHL incubation:
**Label each of 6 small white tube with +/- AHL & +/- IPTG depending upon which test <font color=gray> 3 x +IPTG +AHL, 1 x +IPTG -AHL, 3 x -IPTG +AHL, 1 x -IPTG -AHL</font>
**Add '''800{{uL}}''' of the appropriate AHL sample
**Add '''1200 {{uL}}''' of T9002 of OD600 0.1 (dilute the T9002 if necessary)
**Vortex each tube
*Add a 200uL sample from each tube to the 96 well plate.
*Do this for 8 repeats <font color=gray>This should fill only 8 x 8 = 64 wells </font>
*Add 4 x 200uL of growth medium to a well to act as a control. <font color=gray> Total 68 wells filled</font>
