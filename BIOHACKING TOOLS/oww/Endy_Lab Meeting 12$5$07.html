==Announcements==
*Additional '''475GB''' of network storage just became available:
**Same idea as Bionet: fast data transfer rate (~250MB/min) but located on a [[BioMicro_Center#Access|different server]], so '''no snapshots and no automatic mirroring to another location'''
**Suggested use: space for backups of your desktop data (instead of storing them on Bionet)
*MIT TSM Backup Service will be offering [[Endy:Data_storage#MIT_TSM_Backup_Service|new levels of service]] starting from January 2008
