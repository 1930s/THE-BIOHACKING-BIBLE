linh helped set up my notebook along with prof. koch

read about oscilloscope on wiki site liked above

hooked up oscilloscope to wave machine as i learned last monday

{{Side comment|comment=[[User:Steven J. Koch|Steven J. Koch]] 01:09, 29 August 2007 (EDT):Excellent use of error estimates!}}
1. from the dotted lines it looks like the peak to peak voltage is around 10 V + or- 0.200 volts. and the frequency is around 50 kHz + or - 0.1 kHz

2. my curser showed a peak to peak voltage of 10V also + or - 0.2 volts. the frequency

3. started taking measurements when i got my trigger locked in to keep the sin wave steady
peak to peak voltage is measured to around 10.4 V and frequency is around 50.00 kHz

second wave:  peak to peak voltage reads at about 4.3V + or - 0.1 and frequency is around 58.6 kHz + or - 0.1kHz

==triggering==
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscilloscope#Trigger

a rising edge signifies the trigger points (arrows) will point to the rising side of the wave. which will give it positive voltage when makin readings from left to right of your origin. and falling is the exact opposite. making readings of falling voltage from left to right of your origin.

==ac coupling==
{{Side comment|comment=[[User:Steven J. Koch|Steven J. Koch]] 01:11, 29 August 2007 (EDT):That is interesting about the video triggering beign the best at looking at the ripple.  I wonder why that is?}}
the trigger set on video seems to be the best way to view the ac coupling. it can freeze the ripples the most out of all three so you can make the best reading.

{{Side comment|comment=[[User:Steven J. Koch|Steven J. Koch]] 01:11, 29 August 2007 (EDT):This seems too fast.  Not sure what went wrong.}}the fall time of the square wave measured by the cursor is around 1.220ms

==FFT==
1. the fundamental peak in the fft function shows the frequency of the sine wave at 360.0 Hz


fft is is the reading or a fundamental wave along with its harmonics. fft is useful when finding the fundamental wave and measuring its frequency.


==Oscilloscope Lab Summary==
http://openwetware.org/wiki/Physics307L:Labs/Oscilloscope

this lab was extremely informative about waves. any way you think you could generate a wave was possible so in conclusion, you could experiment with any wave. (to a certian point). i learned aobut fft and ac coupling in a circuit and understood how t measure three different ways using the oscilliscope. although i may not have been right on all my calculations, i'm sure with more practice and work i could be very accurate on any experiment with the oscilliscope. i know it took me a while to finish this which wasn't wise because most of the information is no longer fresh in my mind but thats another thing to remember about taking notes and concluding research. do it as soon as possible with the info still fresh.
