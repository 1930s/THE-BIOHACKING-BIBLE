==Practical with CellML to describe BioBricks==

CellML 1.1 looks very flexible and could provide all the desired features that we are looking for in order to describe a BioBrick [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Help:Contents].
Some testing has to be done on real examples to see how far we can incorporate BioBrick concepts into CellML description capabilities.

*<font color=green>Practical 1: </font> Describe a simple genetic assembly (promoter + RBS + protein coding region + stop codon) from the description of each sub-component.
**example of such a part: <bbpart>BBa_I13522</bbpart>
***It might be better to use <bbpart>BBa_I7101</bbpart> as this has been characterized quite extensively by [[Caitlin Conboy]] and [[Jennifer Braff]] (westerns, northerns etc.).
**the concept of PoPS [http://openwetware.org/wiki/PoPS] could be used as a connection mechanism from a dynamical perspective
**Each part could be represented as a CellML 'component' and then a group could be created to produce the final assembly

*<font color=green>Practical 2:  </font>Describe a standardized inverter as a CellML module (example found here <bbpart>BBa_Q04121</bbpart> )
**NB: this is a non functional assembly as there is no promoter to the coding region
**Define clear inputs and outputs to allow future assembly with counter parts (i.e. LacI protein with LacI promoter)

*<font color=green>Practical 3: </font>From 3 standardized inverter build the Elowitz repressilator
**part found here: <bbpart>BBa_I5610</bbpart>
**demonstrate modularity and re-use offered by CellML
**An abstraction  could  be created to encapsulate everything and define an oscillator device (use of group concept in CellML).

==General aim==
In this article, we are investigating the creation of a virtual equivalent to the [http://parts.mit.edu DNA parts registry] using CellML. Each physical DNA part would have one or multiple models to describe their properties. A model registry could be the core of a CAD system for synthetic biology where new assemblies of parts would be simulated and tested before starting the wetlab.

This problem has 2 main required features: a standardized description language and a structured repository for the created models

*Wish list for a BioBrick description language
**standardized
**machine and human readable
**quantitative and/or qualitative description
