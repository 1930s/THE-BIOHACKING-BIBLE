==Overview==

This short protocol describes how to freeze down and thaw (or bring up) mammalian cells (e.g. HeLa, KEK293, CHO, Jurkat T cells).

==Materials==
List reagents, supplies and equipment necessary to perform the protocol here.

*10-50 ml centrifuge tube
*cryo tubes
*DMSO, Tissue culture (TC)-tested (e.g. [http://www.sigmaaldrich.com Sigma], D2650)
*Cell culture medium (depends on cell line/cells)
*Trypsin-EDTA (e.g. from [http://www.paa.com PAA], L11-004) - for adeherent cells
*'''Freeze-down medium'''
**6-10% DMSO
**Cell culture medium (I recommend to use at least 20% FCS and you can use 100% fetal calf serum (FCS) instead of cell culture medium)
*Basic TC centriguge (0 - 2500 rpm)
*Freeze-down box (this could be simply made from a small styropore box and cotton or from two styropore racks from 15-ml centrifuge tubes )

==Freeze-down (suspension cells)==
#Centrifuge at 80-100 x g for 4-5 min at RT.
#Suck out the medium.
#Resuspend 1-5 x 10*6 cells in appropriate volume of freezing medium (e.g. 1.5 ml for 1.8ml Cryo-tube).
#Transfer cryo-vials with cells into freeze-down box and store at -80 gr.C.
 *Leave over-night at -80 gr.C.
 *You can store cells at -80 gr.C for up to 6 months.
 *Transfer cells into liquid nitrogen a day later for longer storage (1-20 years or so).

==Freeze-down (adherent cells)==
#Wash cells with PBS.
#Add thin layer of Trypsin-EDTA on cells (approx. 1ml for 90 mm Petri dish)
#Observe cells under microscope until these are rounded.
#Add serum-containing medium and resuspend cells. Transfer into centrifuge tubes. 
#Centrifuge at 1000-1200 rpm for 4-5 min at RT.
#Suck out the medium.
#Resuspend cells in appropriate volume of freezing medium (e.g. 1.5 ml for 1.8ml Cryo-tube).
#Transfer cells into freeze-down box and place at -80 gr.C. (Comments as for suspension cells).

==Thawing==
#Keep frozen cells on dry ice until ready for thawing.
#Swirl a vial with frozen cells in 37gr.C water bath and remove just while a sliver of ice remains.
#Spray tube with 70% ethanol for sterilization.
#Aspirate cells from cryo-tube into pre-half-filled pipette with warm culture medium.
#Fill centrifugation tube with culture medium: at least 10 ml total volume.
#Centrifuge for 5 min at 80-100 x g (RT).
#Resuspend pelleted cells in appropriate volume of culture medium and culture o/n in CO2 incubator.
#Optional: Exchange medium next day.
