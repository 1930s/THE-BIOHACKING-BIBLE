*By Xu Anting
==Enzyme Digestion for Vectors==
*I chose plasmid pUC18 as cloning vector.  For plasmid digestion, only 5 hours of reaction is enough.

:R751/pSC101 vector digestion system contains:

<pre>
7.5 µl     10*T buffer (to a final concentration of 1.5*T)
1 µl       BamHI
1 µl       SalI
20 µl      Plasmid pUC18
20.5 µl    ddH20
--------------------------
50 µl      Total
</pre>

:F vector digestion system contains:

<pre>
5 µl       10*K buffer
1 µl       BamHI
20 µl      Plasmid pUC18
24 µl      ddH20
--------------------------
50 µl      Total
</pre>

==Dephosphorylation of pUC18==
*Because F fragment requires single enzyme digestion, F vector has the same sticky ends in its two sides and hence has a high chance of self-ligation.
*For pUC18 the "blue-white" screening could be used to distinguish self-ligated clones from products.  However, to test the efficiency of my dephosphorylation protocol I set up a dephosphorylated control.
#Add 0.5 µL CIAP (calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase) in 10 uL digestion product.
#Bath in 37 centigrade for 30 min.
#Deactivation in 70 centigrade for 10 min.
#PCR kit purification to a final volumne of 10 uL.

==Ligation of PCR fragments and pUC18==
*Ligation conditions: bathing in 4 centigrade for 12-16 hours.

:Ligation system contains:

<pre>
1 µl       10*T4 ligation buffer (Takara)
1 µl       T4 ligase (Takara)
4 µl       digested PCR fragment
4 µl       digested vector
--------------------------
10 µl      Total
</pre>

===Transformation result of R0010<-J23066===
*There are colonies both in the experimental plate and the negative control plate.
*Colonies in the experimental plate are bigger, but both plates are of no differences in the number of colonies.
*Select probable positive colonies from the experimental plate, culture them in liquid LB overday for mini-prep.

==Mini-prep: R0010 and J23066==
*Using Transgen mini plasmid puriflication kit.
*50 uL after purflication.
===mini-prep single digesting test result===
*Digesting R0010 and J23066 with EcoRI. 
*Each digestion system contains：

<pre>
1 µl       10*H
0.5 µl     EcoRI
5 µl       Plasmid
3.5 µl     ddH20
--------------------------
10 µl      Total
</pre>

*37℃ culutre for 4 hours.

*It seems that there are some impurities in the plasmids. I suggest we remini-prep all the plasmids.

==Double Digestion: R0010, J23066 and R0040==
*Digesting R0010 and R0040 with SpeI/PstI, J23066 with PstI/XbaI .

7 µl       ddH20
--------------------------
20 µl      Total

*Treat R0010 with only one system but the other 2 plasmids with two systems.
*37℃ culutre for a whole day.
*Results to be seen tomorrow.

==Double Digestion: B0015 and E0040(pSB3K3)==
*Digesting B0015 with XbaI/PstI(M buffer) and SpeI/PstI(H buffer).
