*Aga1p is a protein is a protein expressed on the cell wall of yeast cells. Protein Aga2p is linked with Aga1p through disulfide bonds. An scFv is fused to the Aga2p protein. scFv has a HA epitope and tagged with c-myc for detection. Note that this surface display is on the '''cell wall'''. There is no signaling involved.
