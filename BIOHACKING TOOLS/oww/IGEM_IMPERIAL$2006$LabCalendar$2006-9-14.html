==Maxiprep 1A and 1G==
*successful

==Ligations for J37024==
*This time, the maxipreped DNA for 1A and 1G was used to do the ligation

*PROBLEM: When doing the gene clean wash and removing the supernatant, the pellet did not stay in the eppendorf but happened to flow out ..... into the waste bucket...... :(
*Ligation could not be continued. 

==Making competent cells==
*This was prepared but then not carried out because the ligation could not be carried out and no competent cells needed for electroporation

==Clearing out the fridge in the Teaching Lab==
*Threw away the following plates: 
**(List to be uploaded)
*Threw away all minipreps
*Threw away all maxipreps that are not needed any more - kept those still needed for further ligations

==Organizing the frozen stock of bacteria in -80{{c}} freezer==
*We now have a frozen stock of DH5a containing the following parts: 
**J37016
**J37015
**J37015 RS
**T9002 (c)and(d)
**J37020
**S01656
*There are 2 competent cells left

==Culturing==
*Cultured all intermediates of any parts we created to be minipreped tomorrow
*Make a frozen stock of the ones that worked - to be sent to the Registry later
