==Overview==

Making selective yeast plates.

==Materials==

*Nanopure water
*Yeast nitrogen base (YNB)
*Ammonium sulfate
*Agar
*Sugars (normally 20% dextrose, alternative 20% raffinose/10% sucrose/20% galactose)
*Amino acid dropout solution (in 4&deg;C room)

==Procedure==
N.B. - this protocol makes 12 plates. Adjust volumes as needed.

#Mix:
#*200 mL NP water (or less, if using alternate sugars)
#*0.425g YNB (Stored in cold room)
#*1.25g NH<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
#*5g Difco agar (''not'' Bacto agar)
#Mix the solution well and autoclave on liquid cycle
#After autoclaving, run cold water over the bottle to cool
#When bottle is cool enough to touch with the bare hand, add dropout solution and sugar(s)
#Swirl to mix, then pour into plates
#*Pour just enough cover the base (shake the plate a little to get an even layer)
#*Briefly flame the top of the plate to eliminate bubbles

==Notes==
*Before autoclaving, the mixture will separate into two layers. It should go into solution after autoclaving.
*If pouring multiple bottles of media, the remaining bottles can stay in the autoclave until needed.
*I've found that it cuts down on condensation if you pile the plates on top of each other while they dry. -[[User:Jkm|Jkm]]
*If you don't want to flame, drop a stirbar into the flask before autoclaving.  Mix on the stirplate to add sugar and aa's, stir some more to take care of bubbles.  Pour carefully. -[[User:Tsbayer|tsb]]
