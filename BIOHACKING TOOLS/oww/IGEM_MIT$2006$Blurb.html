==Project description==

[[Image:MIT2006systembehavior.png|200px|thumb|right|'''Figure 2: Schematic overview of system behavior.''']]

This summer, MIT's iGEM 2006 team engineered ''Escherichia coli'' to produce a wintergreen scent during exponential phase and a banana scent during stationary phase using ''only'' endogenous metabolites (figure 2).  Thus, our project demonstrates that 

#It is indeed possible to design, build and test a synthetic biological system over the course of a summer.
#Biosynthetic devices that produce scented compounds can be successfully engineered in ''E. coli''.
#Biosynthetic devices can be purposefully regulated via transcription based control devices.

===Motivations===
Our project focused on engineering ''Escherichia coli'' to produce different compounds that smell fragrant.  Since scents can both act as natural reporters and have a diverse array of applications, they represent a promising but thus far unexplored area of synthetic biology.

Future applications of this work that we envision include ...
*Improving the workplace environment for microbiologists working with ''Escherichia coli'' since ''E. coli'' produce a natural foul scent.
*Porting our system to bacterial species involved in bioremediation.
*Implementing our system in bacteria responsible for bad human odor in the mouth, armpits and feet.

===Contributions===
The following parts, devices, chassis, and systems have been designed, built, and tested to demonstrate that they work.

[[Image:iGEM_MIT2006_Fullsystem.jpg|600px|thumb|left|'''Figure 3: Black box system diagram.'''  SAGD = salicylic acid generating device; WGD = wintergreen generating device; IAGD = isoamyl alcohol generating device; BSGD = banana smell generating device.  ]]

====Parts====
All of our parts are on the [http://parts.mit.edu/r/parts/partsdb/pgroup.cgi?pgroup=iGEM2006&group=iGEM2006_MIT registry].

''Wintergreen'' (methyl salicylate):
# <bbpart>BBa_J45017</bbpart>: pchBA - proteins that generate salicylic acid from chorismate (endogenous molecule involved in amino acid biosynthesis)
# <bbpart>BBa_J45004</bbpart>: BSMT - enzyme that converts salicylic acid to methyl salicylate

''Banana'' (isoamyl acetate):
# <bbpart>BBa_J45008</bbpart>: BAT2 - enzyme that catalyzes the first step in isoamyl alcohol biosynthesis from L-leucine (endogenous amino acid)
# <bbpart>BBa_J45009</bbpart>: THI3 - enzyme that catalyzes the second step in isoamyl alcohol biosynthesis
# <bbpart>BBa_J45014</bbpart>: ATF1 - enzyme that converts isoamyl alcohol to isoamyl acetate

''Control'':
# <bbpart>BBa_J45992</bbpart>: osmY stationary phase promoter

====Devices====
#A biosynthetic device that converts salicylic acid to methyl salicylate (or wintergreen) (<bbpart>BBa_J45100</bbpart>).
#A biosynthetic device that converts isoamyl alcohol to isoamyl acetate (or banana smell) (<bbpart>BBa_J45200</bbpart>).
#A biosynthetic precursor device that converts chorismate to salicylic acid (<bbpart>BBa_J45300</bbpart>).
#A biosynthetic precursor device that converts leucine to isoamyl alcohol (<bbpart>BBa_J45400</bbpart>).
#A PoPS source that is only active during stationary phase (<bbpart>BBa_J45992</bbpart>).
#*Stationary phase occurs when the cell culture reaches a sufficiently high density that growth slows due to lack of nutrients. Cell number tends to remain approximately constant.
#A PoPS source that is only active during exponential phase.(<bbpart>BBa_J45996</bbpart>)  The osmY stationary phase promoter was connected to the <bbpart>BBa_Q04401</bbpart> inverter.
#*Exponential phase is the growth stage where cells undergo their maximum rate of cell division.

====Chassis====
We have obtained from the Yale Genomic Stock Center, a strain of ''E. coli'' that does not have a noticeable smell (i.e. indole deficient). This strain is the chassis of choice for all of our biosynthetic devices (<bbpart>BBa_J45999</bbpart>)

====Systems====
#''E. coli'' capable of producing a wintergreen scent using ''only'' endogenous metabolites . (Available as <bbpart>BBa_J45700</bbpart>)
#''E. coli'' capable of producing a banana scent during stationary phase using ''only'' endogenous metabolites. (Available as cotransformation of <bbpart>BBa_J45400</bbpart> and <bbpart>BBa_J45250</bbpart> - also building <bbpart>BBa_J45600</bbpart> to have them on a single plasmid).
#''E. coli'' capable of producing a wintergreen scent during exponential phase and a banana scent during stationary phase using ''only'' endogenous metabolites. (cotransformation of <bbpart>BBa_J45600</bbpart> and <bbpart>BBa_J45800</bbpart> ''in progress'').

===Characterization===
* Smell test: Our systems definitely do smell nice! 
* Stationary phase promoter: see [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_J45992:Experience results] of connecting osmY promoter to GFP demonstrating that the stationary and exponential devices work as expected.
* Wintergreen generating device: see gas chromatography [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_J45004:Experience results] demonstrating that our wintergreen generating device does in fact produce methyl salicylate in ''E. coli''. 
* No smell chassis: see gas chromatography [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_J45999:Experience results] demonstrating that our indole deficient strain does not produce indole.

===Future work===
In the future, we envision doing the following ...
#Porting the biosynthetic device that synthesizes isoamyl acetate to yeast to make banana bread.
#Porting the biosynthetic device that synthesizes methyl salicylate to ''Pseudomonas fluorescens'', a species commonly used in bioremediation.
#Carrying out more extensive, quantitative characterization of our biosynthetic devices using gas chromatography.
