3. Report your value for R.

For Hydrogen: 10,978,682 m−1 +/- 6000 m−1 the real value for the rydberg constant is 10,973,735.3 m−1 which falls into the std dev. the mean has a .45 percent error from the true value. 

For Deuterium:we got 10983540 m-1 +/- 11080.27 m-1 for the rydberg constant for deuterium. This seems right because the rydberg constant for deuterium should not be much different then that of hydrogen.

4. What did you learn? 

I learned how to do some data analysis on excel and how to correctly set up and operate a spectrometer.
