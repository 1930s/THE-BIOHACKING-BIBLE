*Step 1: Overnight culture from Perry's frozen stock of bacteria with LppOmpA plasmid. 
*Step 2: Plasmid prep of LppOmpA plasmid.
*Step 3: Purification of plasmid.
*Step 4: Design primers for PCR.
*Step 5: Produce PCR product and run on gel.

Result: Good bands for all three reactions, but signs of template present in all three.

*Step 6: Topo cloning reaction: Mix PCR product and pTrcHis2-TOPO
*Step 7: Transform mix into OneShot E.coli cells
*Step 8: Overnight culture of colonies to analyze positive clones
*Step 9: Plasmid prep of culture
*Step 10: Digestion with Nco1 and EcoR1 and run on gel.

Result: Colonies grown because of template.  They either cut once (one site present in template) or cut twice (two close sites present on the template).
Solution: Clonewell PCR product and select for the cut fragments.

*Step 11: Clonewell PCR product
*Step 12: Repeat steps 6-10.
