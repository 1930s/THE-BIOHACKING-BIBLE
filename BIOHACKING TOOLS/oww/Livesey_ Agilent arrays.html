1 Combine 5 μg Cy5- and 5 μg Cy3-labeled samples in a total of 150 μL ddH2O
in a 1.5 mL microfuge tube.

2 Add the following in the order indicated to the microfuge tube:

3 Heat samples for 3 minutes at 95°C.

4 Mix contents and quick spin to collect.

5 Immediately transfer the sample tubes to a circulating water bath or heat
block at 37°C and incubate for 30 minutes.

6 Spin at 17,900 × g for 1 minute at room temperature to collect the sample.

7 Load a clean gasket slide into the Agilent SureHyb chamber base with the
label facing up and aligned with the rectangular section of the chamber
base. Ensure that the gasket slide is flush with the chamber base and is not
ajar.

8 Slowly dispense 490 μL of hybridization sample onto the gasket well in a
"drag and dispense" manner.

9 Place an array “active side” down onto the SureHyb gasket slide, so the
numeric barcode side is facing up and the “Agilent” barcode is facing down.
Make sure the sandwich-pair is properly aligned.
NOTE Use foils and amber tubes to keep samples in the dark as much as possible.

10 Place the SureHyb chamber cover onto the sandwiched slides and slide on
the clamp assembly. Hand-tighten the clamp onto the chamber.

11 Vertically rotate the assembled chamber to wet the gasket and assess the
mobility of the bubbles. Tap the assembly on a hard surface if necessary to
move stationary bubbles.

12 Place assembled slide chamber in rotisserie hybridization oven set to 40°C.
Hybridize at 10 rpm for 40 hours.
You can use a higher rotation speed (up to 20 rpm) to enhance the overall
assay signal intensity.
