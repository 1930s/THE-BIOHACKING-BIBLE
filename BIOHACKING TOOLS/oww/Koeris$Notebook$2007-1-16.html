As one finds often, good planning is half the work. Now I need to re-transform both A and B constructs into K12 EMG2 cells in order to make more plasmid, since I can't find the stocks. On the other hand I did find the 06 stock but no plasmid prep... So I got to grow that one up again, too. Bottom line: wasted a day.

=Sequencing of [His]<sub>6</sub> constructs=
All three constructs need to be sequenced. New sequencing service in use at Boston University: [http://www.genewiz.com GeneWiz].

Samples need to be dropped off '''BEFORE 4pm''' at Larry Valles office LSEB601.

==Set up of sequencing==

'''IMPORTANT: DILUTE STOCK PRIMERS to 2pmol/ul'''

Measure concentration of all 3 constructs
*06
*07
*08
===Sample set up guidelines===
*Submit your samples in 0.2 ml, 8-strip PCR tubes, one sample per tube.
*For the amount of template needed, please refer to the following table.
*Provide 8 microliters (without primer) or 12 microliters (premixed with primer) of DNA per tube.

===Label Sample Tubes===
Please label your tube on the SIDE with the corresponding sample ID. Cap your 8-strip tubes tightly with matching 8-strip caps. Try to provide some cushion around the tubes to avoid any potential damage during shipping.

===Send Samples===
Send your samples along with a printed copy of the order summary to GENEWIZ via the preferred overnight courier service at FedEx.
