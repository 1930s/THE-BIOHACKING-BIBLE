Dear Students,

The BE Student Board is always looking for new ideas for activities (both social and academic in nature) that would benefit the student body and for people to help organize these activities. Based on the responses from the annual survey, we know that many of you have great ideas for events and we would like to see them realized.

Therefore, the student board is pleased to announce the availability of a "new events fund." The purpose of this is to provide funding support for students who would like to organize events for BE. If you are interested in taking advantage of this, please email beboard@mit.edu with your idea.  We'll contact you to plan and discuss the proposed event.  Based on the funds available to us we hope to be able to offer ~$250 per event but we will consider cheaper or more expensive events. Members of the board are happy to offer assistance in any way possible.

As always, if you are interested in helping to organize existing events, or would like ideas to start with, please contact the board and/or come to the monthly meetings.

Thank you and we hope to hear from you soon!

On behalf of the Student Board,
Diana and Barry
