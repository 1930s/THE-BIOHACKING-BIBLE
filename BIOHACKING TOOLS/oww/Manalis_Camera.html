Our lab camera lives in a shelving unit in the lab storage room.  In there you'll find:

* The camera, a Canon PowerShot A640
* An adapter for mounting the camera on the lab microscopes
* Two phototubes that screw onto the front of the adapter; one of the two should fit your microscope
* A battery charger plugged into the wall to the left of the camera's shelving unit
* Assorted cords (AC adapter, USB cable)

When using the camera with a microscope, you generally have to zoom in to make the image fill the entire screen.  The digital zoom is helpful for fine focusing.

We don't have a remote shutter for this camera (Canon doesn't make them) but the PC program [http://www.breezesys.com/PSRemote/ PSRemote] can supposedly control our camera from a computer.
