Apparently there is nonrandom codon pair utilization in many species.  Codon pairs may affect translational elongation rates and therefore protein production.  (There can be translational pause sites that are species-specific.)

[http://www.codagenomics.com/ CODA genomics] checks and optimizes for such things.

(Note: I haven't read the papers to evaluate this claim.  Just posting the info here so that I remember it.)
