=Agenda=
#Decide on constitutive promoter for CPX
#*Transform promoter into DH5a
#*Plate transformants
#Check sequencing results for Mer/GFP 3A
#Perform flourescence assay on mer-gfp construct
#Clean out fridge

===Flourescence Assay Protocol===
# Draw sample of 1.5 ml from incubated cells with Hg
# Plot OD's
# Spin down 3 mins at 13000 rpm
# Aspirate and resuspend in 1.5 ml .9% NaCl
# Repeat 3
# Repeat 4
# Put 150ul in plate reader

===Sequencing Results===
*mer.I13500 in pSB1AT3 came back really crappy.  Biobrick prefix and suffix are partially present, cannot locate the sequence for GFP.
*Need to send in the parts for sequencing.
*Will run a colony PCR as a diagnostic?

===Constitutive Promoter===
Construct containing CPX and the polystyrene-binding peptide that will hopefully go into final system:

I14032/R0051.B0034.CPX-insert.

I14032 is a lacI repressable constitutive promoter.  R0051 is a lambda cl repressable promoter.
===Things That Got Cleaned Out===
Ask Semmie.
