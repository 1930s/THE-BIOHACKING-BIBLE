You may have missed a standalone program I wrote. The storm program is written in C++, and available
open source as part of the cread package (cread.sf.net). It uses the same format for matrices as
does TRANSFAC, and is very good if you have lots of matrices to search for in the same sequences
because it pre-processes them as suffix trees. If you choose to try storm, I'll help in any way I
can. Also, we have plans to turn all the useful objects in cread into C++ extensions for python, but
have not had the time yet.
