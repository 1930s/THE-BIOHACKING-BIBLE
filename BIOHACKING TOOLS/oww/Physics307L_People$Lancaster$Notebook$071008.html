==Part A==


'''Blue- '''

Initial voltage- 9.490

Time for voltage to accumulate:

'''Blue'''

100% transmission - 1.09 s          1.78s  

80%- 1.66 s                         2.34s

60% - 2.65 s                        2.30s

40% - 3.94 s                        2.56s
 
20% - 4.72                          5.81s

'''Green '''

100% transmission - 3.22 s         3.19s

80% - 3.34s                        4.11s

60% - 5.96s                        8.72s 

40% - 9.50s                        12.28s

20% - 16.72s                       18.4s

==Part B==

Yellow (w/ filter) -      .723V     .722V

Green (w/ green filter) - .856V     .853V 

Blue/Green  -            1.501V    1.501V

Blue -                   1.716V    1.713V

Blue/violet -            2.063V    2.064V

==Experiment 2==

We are both taking two sets of data for each order
