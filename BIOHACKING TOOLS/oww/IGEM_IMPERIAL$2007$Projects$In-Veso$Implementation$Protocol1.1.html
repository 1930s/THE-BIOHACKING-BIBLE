==1.1 Protocol for Empty Vesicle Formation==

===Day 1===
====Equipment====
* 100ml glass beaker x1
* Gilsson pipette (200µl) + pipette tips
* Nitrogen tap
* 1000µl pipette tip
* Desiccator connected to a vacuum
* 25ml Glass pipette x1
* Sonicator with medium-sized probe
* 25°C incubator 
====Reagents====
* 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) 20mg/ml in chloroform, ≥99.0%
* Mineral oil
''(Note: Alternatively, use POPC and dodecane)''

'''Preparing the lipid-oil suspension for the inner leaflet'''
# Place 125 µl of the 20 mg/ml DOPC solution in a 100-ml glass beaker. '''(Equipment should generally be made of glass and not plastic so as to prevent adhesion of lipid molecules to plastic surface)'''
# Using plastic tubing and a 1ml pipette tip, evaporate the chloroform under nitrogen to obtain a dry, thin lipid film. '''(Rubber tubes are not recommended as they are more likely to emit debis into the lipid film)'''
# Put the beaker in a desiccator connected to a vacuum for 1hr. '''(This is to remove the chloroform)'''
# Add 50 ml of mineral oil to reach a final lipid concentration of 0.05 mg/ml
# Place the beaker containing the suspension in the ice bath
# Sonicate suspension for 30 min (Pulse 1, ~10 Amp). '''(This is to disperse the phospholipids)'''
# Leave overnight at 25°C to ensure that the lipid molecules are fully dispersed in oil


===Day 2===
====Equipment====
* Magnetic stirrer
* 200µl pipette + tips
* 1000µl pipette + tips
* 50ml 1-inch diameter glass centrifuge tube 
* 1-inch diameter tabletop centrifuge
* 5ml syringe + long 16-gauge stainless steel needle x1
* Test tube x1

====Reagents====
* Solution A
** Tris buffer
** NaCl
** ddH<sub>2</sub>0


'''Preparation of Solution A'''
# Prepare a 10ml solution A with 100 mM NaCl and 5 mM Tris buffer at pH 7.4


'''Emulsifying the Aqueous Solution'''
# Separate about 5 ml of the lipid-oil suspension into a glass container. '''(For the interface preparation)'''
# Add 250 µl of solution A to the 45ml lipid-oil suspension in mineral oil. '''(This is the aqeous solution that would be encapsulated in the vesicles)'''
# Gently stir the mixture with a magnetic stir bar for 3 hours.


'''Preparing the interface''' (While emulsion is mixed)
# Place 2 ml of lipid-oil suspension over 3 ml of solution A in a 1-inch-diameter centrifuge tube. 
# Leave for 2–3 h for lipids to achieve the coverage of the interface surface '''(>3h and the lipid may start to clump together)'''
''(Note: This step can been modified to use 2ml of emulsified solution instead of the lipid-oil suspension)''


'''Formation of bi-layer vesicles'''
# Pour 100 µl of the inverted emulsion over the interface. ''(Note: This step is omitted if 2ml of emulsified solution is used instead of the lipid-oil suspension)''
# Centrifuge at 120 x g for 10 min
''(Note: Alternatively, centrifuge at 30 x g for 20 min)''


'''Collecting the vesicles:'''
# Using a 5-ml syringe with a long 16-gauge stainless steel needle, collect some of solution A.
# Expel some of the solution to remove all air from the syringe and needle. '''(Expelling most of the Solution A would ensure a less diluted solution of vesicles)'''
# With the tip of the needle in the aqueous phase, gently expel the solution contained in the syringe. '''(This prevents the extraction of the lipid-oil suspension when the needle is plunged into the tube)'''
# Gently recirculate the buffer several times.
# Aspirate most of the solution into the syringe, and remove the needle from the solution. '''(Be careful not to aspirate the lipid-oil suspension)'''
# Wipe the tip of the needle clean.
# Unload the vesicle suspension into a test tube.
# Use optical microscopy to check that the vesicles obtained were not deformed or aggregated. Ideally, the protocol should yield ~10<sup>9</sup> vesicles of 1µm diameter. 


===Notes===
* Time required for Day 1: ~ 2h; for Day 2: ~4h.
* The protocol is based on [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=12963816 Engineering Asymmetric Vesicles] by Sophie Pautot, Barbara J. Frisken, and D. A. Weitz.
*Modifications to protocol:
** The original protocol uses anhydrous 99:1 dodecane:silicone oil solution instead of mineral oil
** The original protocol uses POPC instead of DOPC phospholipids
** The original protocol sonicates the suspension in a cleaning sonic bath for 30 min
* Use of salt in the solution A preparation may require osmolarity considerations
* Use of GFP as a visual signal may require osmolarity considerations
