===Summary===

7H9 (and its solid counterpart, [[McKinney:7H10|7H10 agar]]) are selective media used for the culture of free-living mycobacteria such as ''M. tuberculosis'' and ''M. smegmatis.''

===Ingredients===

(makes 1L medium)

* Deionized water
* 4.7g Middlebrook 7H9 powder (DifCo catalog # 0713-01-7)
* 5mL 10% Tween-80: Dilute 40g Tween-80 (liquid) into final volume 200mL with deionized water.  Stir on low heat (~65&deg;C) until completely dissolved (may take ~15 minutes).  Filter sterilize with a 0.22&mu;m filter.  Store at 4&deg;C wrapped in aluminum foil, as Tween is light sensitive.

For ''M. tuberculosis'':
* 100mL [[McKinney:OADC|OADC]] (Dubos/Middlebrook Oleic Acid Albumin Dextrose Complex)
* 10mL 50% glycerol
* (If you are using lung homogenates or the like) 10mL 10mg/mL cyclohexamide

For ''M. smegmatis'':
* 100mL ADS (Albumin-Dextrose-Saline): 8.1g NaCl, 50g Bovine Serum Albumin Fraction V, 20g anhydrous dextrose in 1L deionized water.   Filter sterilize in a 0.22&mu;m filter, and store at 4&deg;C.

===Protocol===

# Dissolve 4.7g Middlebrook 7H9 poweder in 900mL deionized water.  Mix with a magnetic stir bar until soluble components have dissolved.
# Add the rest of the ingredients appropriate for the organism at hand and continue stirring until well mixed.
# Sterilize by filtration through a 0.22&mu;m pore membrane.  Store at 4&deg;C.
