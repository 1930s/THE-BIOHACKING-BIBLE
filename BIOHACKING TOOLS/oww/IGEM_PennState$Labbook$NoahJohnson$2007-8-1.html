*Ran gel on PCR products
*Start @ 11:00

Well
*1   . 2-log ladder
*2   . 1kb ladder
*3   . crp* Taq 75C
*4   . (-) Taq 75C
*5   . crp* Pfu #1 75C
*6   . crp* Pfu #2 75C
*7   . crp* Pfu #3 75C
*8   . (-) Pfu 75C
*9   . crp* Taq 72C
*10  . (-) Taq 72C
*11  . crp* Pfu #1 72C
*12  . crp* Pfu #2 72C
*13  . crp* Pfu #3 72C
*14  . (-) Pfu 72C

PCR didnt seem to work with Pfu
*Re-ran large gradient PCR with gradient from 55C-72C

*Ran Gel from PCR products
Results:
*no crp* seen
*probably a problem with Pfu PCR protocol

PCR rxns with Pfu havent been working so I'm going to dilute the primers 10:1 because we think that they could be too concentrated. All other parts of the protocol I will keep constant but I will add 1uL of each primer diluted 10:1 and run a gradient PCR from 61C-72C.
*Negative ran at 71.4C
