==Evaporation experiments==
*'''Aim''': The aim of the experiments carried out today was to figure out a method to avoid evaporation of samples.
*We monitered evaporation of samples in:
**PCR tubes
**96 well plate with single tape layer
**96 well plate with multiple layers of tape
**96 well plate with single tape and pipetting
*We found out that none of these methods effeciently stop evaporation (more explainantion + link to results!!)
