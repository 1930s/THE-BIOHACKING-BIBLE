*Ran PCR cleanup on the 8 PCR rxns that worked from yesterday (all except 0.1uL for Buffer#1). Combined all into one sample.
*Restriction digest with EcoR1 and SpeI
*Assumed we maxed out the spin column so 10ug DNA was eluded in 28uL EB Buffer leading to a DNA concentration of ~357ng/uL

<h2>Restriction Digest Protocol</h2>
1. Added to tubes:
*2uL DNA (~350 ng/uL)
*1uL 10x Buffer
*1uL BSA
*0.5uL each restriction enzyme
*5uL dH2O
2. Gingerly flick tube to mix
3. Spin down tubes briefly
4. Incubate at 37C in water bath for 1-4 hrs (1-2 hrs optimal)


*Also doing restriction on P1010 w/ psB1A2 which will be the vector for the following ligation. 
*Started incubating at 12:45pm

*Ran P1010 on a gel to isolate it from psB1A2
*Seems the restriction didnt work as planned. Going to grow up P1010 in psB1A2 overnight and miniprep and restrict again in the morning.

9:30-5
