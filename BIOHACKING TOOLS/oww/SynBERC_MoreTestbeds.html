There were several proposals for new testbeds:

==Possible Testbeds==
#[[SynBERC:Counter|Counter]] -> Computer  (Endy lab)
#[[SynBERC:Safe strains|Safe strains]]  (Farren Isaacs, Church lab)
#*Kill switches
#*Could incorporate a counter
#[[SynBERC:Energy|Energy]]  (Keasling, BP)
#*How can we contribute to this research agenda?

==Other suggestions==
''Feel free to add/edit this list.''
#Counter
#Scented bacteria
#Plant endosymbiot
#Virtual OS
#Free-living nitrogen fixers
#Materials science (bio-materials)
#Genome upload/download
#Genetic stability and instability
#Kill switch hooked up to a counter
#Make use of unnatural AA
#Chassis for protein expression, limit incorporation of strange AAs
#Enhance E.coli for DNA manipulation
#Bio-remediation
#Waste management
#Changing cell membrane composition
#Engineer cellular communities
#Introduce recombination sites into E.coli to shuffle genomes on command – faster genome recombination.
#E.coli that doubles every 10 mins – divide the chromosome in half.  One off oriC and one at F plasmid.
#Running systems at stationary phase.
#Select for E.coli that are longer
#Refactored E.coli
#Yeast recombination system in E.coli
#In vivo SNP detection system.
