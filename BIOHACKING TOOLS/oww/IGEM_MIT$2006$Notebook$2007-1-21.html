**Veena thought that 700A, 700D, 700E, 900C, and 900D smelled but could not smell the others.  However, she said that her nose was runny.

***Jason thought that each culture he smelled (900A, 900B, 600A, and 700A) smelled great.

==To Do==

1. Dilute from two samples of each part type into new, 10 mL cultures.  We will use these tomorrow when we are experimenting with the GC. SP picked 700A, 700E, 900A, 900B, 600A, and 600B.- DONE

2. Organize plates.- DONE

3. Clean tubes.- DONE

4. Update google doc.- DONE

5. Submit the sequencing sheet.- DONE

6. Streak indole-knockout strain onto plate (first step towards making the cells competent).- DONE
