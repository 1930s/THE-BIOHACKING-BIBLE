<!-- COPY EVERTYHING BELOW HERE TO START A NEW CONSENSUS PROTOCOL!  -->

==Curators==
Add the primary curators here (including their contact info).  For instance,

James Hadfield, CRUK Cambridge Research Institute, Robinson Way, Cambridge CB2 0RE. Tel: +44 (0)1223 404250; Fax: +44 (0)1223 404208; email: jamesdothadfieldatcancerdoyorgdotuk.

''Anyone should feel free to add themselves as a curator for this consensus protocol.  You do not need to be a curator in order to contribute.  The OpenWetWare community is currently [[OpenWetWare:Information management/Protocol curators|discussing the idea of protocol curators]].  Please contribute.''

==Abstract==
Replace this sentence with a brief description of the protocol and its goal.

==Materials==
List everything necessary to perform the protocol here. Include all information about suppliers, ordering details, etc.  Links to the suppliers' page on that material are also appropriate and encouraged. Please be aware that users of this protocol may not be working in the same country as you.
===Reagents===
Biological resources e.g. cell lines, buffers (link to a method for making them), enzymes, chemicals, kits, etc.
===Equipment===
Any equipment used to perform the protocol (link to a method for using them).

==Procedure==
A step by step guide to the experimental procedure.

Protocol for passing cells on fibronectin-coated dishes.

1.	Prepare fibronectin-coated dishes.
Put 150ul fibronectin solution (20-40 ug/ml in water) at the center of glass-bottom dish, then overnight in CO2 incubator or 2 hours without cover in hood at RT.

2.	Detach cells (HeLa, MEF) with 4 mM EDTA(in PBS)  in CO2 incubator for 15 min, then slightly blow down the cells from the bottom of culture dish. The other steps are similar as normal pass.

3.	Usually before imaging, incubate cells on fibronectin-coated dishes in CO2 incubator for 1-6 h.

==Critical steps==
Referenced from the main protocol, a more thorough explanation of particularly important steps in the protocol.

==Troubleshooting==
Referenced from the main protocol, an explanation of what can cause things to go wrong with the protocol.

==Notes==
Referenced from the main protocol, any comments about the protocol should be made here; i.e. how it was developed. Any comments added should be signed (by adding <nowiki>*'''~~~~''':</nowiki> in front) and explained. Links to FAQs/tips provided by other sources such as the manufacturer or other websites would be best made here.<br>
Anecdotal observations that might be of use to others can also be posted here; e.g. 'my cells were still floating'.<br>

It might also be good to add an image to show the workflow and timescales for experiment planning.
