This literature review is compiled by Scott based on the list of references below. Other lab members are welcome to contribute references, along with a summary of information extracted from them. 

This is a link to a project called TELEMAC.  It is based over in Europe and is concerned with control and remote sensing of anaerobic digesters for wastewater treatment.  There is a neat little application to run a digester if you are interested.
