==Single-Chain Fragment Variable Antibody Piezoimmunosensors==

===The Big Picture===
A biosensor was created using an scFV bound to a gold surface.  We can use the anti-rabbit Igg scFV that they created (which includes the heavy, light, and a linker sequence in between) as the secondary antibody in our system.  This secondary antibody will be fused to the transmembrane protein.

*Nonlabeled biosensor with high diagnostic potential for rapid and sensitive detection of antigens.
**Piezoimmunosensor (PZ) displaying a specifically constructed recombinant antibody on its surface.
**scFV contained cysteine within the linker aa sequence to join heavy + light chains. 
**Presence of cysteine induced scFv to self-assemble as densely packed rigid monolayer on gold surface of quartz crystal microbalance.
**Self-assemble monolayer (SAM) exhibited defined orientation and high areal densities displaying 35x as many variable antigen-binding sites per square cm as surfaces modified with whole antibody.
**Capable of detecting low concentrations of antigens in complex samples.

*Ideal Biosensor
**sensitive
**rapid
**reliable
**robust
**inexpensive
