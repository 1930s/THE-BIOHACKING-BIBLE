MCB 100: Synthetic Biology (Project 3)<br>
First year: Fall semester, 2005 <br>
Teaching Assistants: Franklin Huang and Austin Che <br>
Class size: 11 <br>

Goals 
       - Fix the non-working BioSketch assembly<br>
       - Assemble an alternative BioSketch assembly<br>
       - Research potential sensors that can work in bacteria and clone<br>
         them into a usable form<br>        
       - Designing a generic modular system to test and characterize the<br>
         sensors<br>
       - Connect the sensors to BioSketch (e.g. imagine sketching with<br>
         ethanol instead of UV)<br>
