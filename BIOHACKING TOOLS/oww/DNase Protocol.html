==Overview==

Protocol for DNase treatment of total RNA. This uses a DNase inactivating reagent and thus avoids the DNase heat inactivation step that makes me nervous.

==Materials==
*THAWED 10X DNase Buffer
*
*X &mu;L reagent 2
**component A (reagent 2 is made up of multiple components)
**component B
*equipment 1
*equipment 2

==Procedure==
#In order to DNase 20ug of RNA in a 100ul reaction, mix the following:
::*10&mu;L 10X DNase buffer
::*78&mu;L dH<sub>2</sub>0
::*2&mu;L DNase
::*10&mu;L RNA(1ug/&mu;L)
#Incubate at 37&deg; C for 20-30 min.
#Add 0.1 volume resuspended DNase Inactivation Reagent.
#Incubate 2 min at RT mixing every 30s.
#Centrifuge at 10,000xg for 1.5 min.
#Transfer solution to a new tube avoiding pelleted Inactivation Reagent.
