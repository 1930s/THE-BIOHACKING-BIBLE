PROTOCOL FOR MAKING KCM COMPETENT CELLS<br>
	wear gloves, change gloves frequently to reduce contamination<br>
1	Streak competent cells onto an LB plate, grow overnight at 37°C<br>
2	Choose a colony with a toothpick and innoculate 500ml of LB
	grow overnight at 37°C with shaking at 215rpm<br>
3	Dilute 1:100 in 500ml ofprewarmed LB, grow to OD 0.4-0.5
	(between 2 and 3 hrs), 37°C at 215rpm<br>
4	Spin down in four 250ml prechilled bottles at 5000rpm in the JA-14 for 5 min	put bottles on ice, go to cold room<br>
<br>
	DO THE REST IN THE COLD ROOM<br>
	Have in the cold room:<br>
	25ml pipettes in metal box  for cell resuspension<br>
	Electric pipettor<br>
	a BIG beaker of 1.5ml eppendorf tubes that are sterile<br>
	1ml pipette man and box of 1ml tips<br>
	TSS solution<br>
	styrofoam ice bucket with 500ml of 100% ethanol in it + dry ice<br>
	floaty racks<br>
	fat sharpie markers with the appropriate color for your competent cells<br>
	 (TG1= green, Novablue=blue, BL21 (DE3) pLyseS= red)<br>
	paper towels<br>
	gloves<br>
	cart (you will work entirely on the cart because there isn't any extra
	bench space in the cold room)<br>
	freezer boxes labelled appropriately (name of cells in the appropriate color
	that matches the color on the tops of their lids)<br>
	sterile spatula<br>
	3 eppendorf tube racks<br>
<br>
	TSS solution (makes100ml of solution):<br>
	10g PEG 3350 ( fc=10%)<br>
	5ml DMSO (fc=5%)<br>
	2ml 1M MgCl2 (fc=20mM)<br>
	LB broth to bring the volume up to 100ml<br>
	pH should be 6.5, check using paper and sterile tips<br>
<br>
5	Scoop pellets using spatula into one centrifuge bottle<br>
6	Add 25-50ml of the ICE COLD TSS to the combined pellets<br>
7	Resuspend pellets using the prechilled pipettes and the electric pipettor
	try hard to not get the cell suspension into the pipettor, homogenize well<br>
8	place 20 tubes or so into a rack<br>
9	add 25-50ml of the ICE COLD TSS to the combined pellets<br>
10	Close the lids, take the sharpie with the right color
	and mark a line across every lid to indicate the what cell it is<br>
11	place tubes into floaty rack, place rack into -80° ethanol/dry ice mix
	wait until mix has stopped boiling<br>
12	take tubes out, place into freezer box, place box on ice<br>
13	repeat until all of the cell suspension has been aliquoted out<br>
14	run to our -80° freezer and put the freezer box inside (you don't want the
	cells to thaw once frozen, you must work very quickly)<br>
<br>
	Clean up, go home.  You've worked hard :)<br>
