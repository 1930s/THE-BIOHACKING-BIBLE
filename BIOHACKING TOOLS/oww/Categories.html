This is the categories page for OpenWetWare.  We use categories like tags.  For instance, [[DNA ligation]] would be tagged with the categories: [[:Category:Protocol]], [[:Category:In vitro]] and [[:Category:DNA]].  The advantage is that you can add articles to multiple categories by simply typing:
  [[Category:''foo'']] where ''foo'' is the category name
The category pages are then updated automatically to include the article in alphabetical order.  Note that categories can be added fairly easily after articles are written. To point to a category in an article without making the article fall into that category use:
  [[:Category:''foo'']] where ''foo'' is the category name, note ':' in front of Category
