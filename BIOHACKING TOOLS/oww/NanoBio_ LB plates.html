=LB media=
*For 1L of media, mix in a 2 L plastic bucket:
**20 g LB (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #)
**distilled water to 1 L

*Aliquot the liquid media in 500 mL bottles. Do not include a stirrer bar in the bottle. Tighten the cap such that the lid is loose, but cannot be pulled off. 
*Autoclave for 15 min at 121C (250F). In 5218, this is Program 09.
*Once the media has cooled to room temperature, tighten the caps.

=LB plates=
*For ~2 sleeves of plates, mix in a 2 L flask:
**20 g LB (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #)
**1 L distilled water
*Dissolve completely.
*Add & mix:
**20 g Bacto-agar (BD Biosciences, catalog #)

*Autoclave in 500 mL bottles for 15 min at 121C (250F). In 5218, this is Program 09.
*Allow to cool to ~50C. Add and mix antibiotics as appropriate [[NanoBio:_Antibiotics| (refer to working antibiotic concentrations)]].
**Note: It is important to cool the media sufficiently such that it is safe to handle and that the antibiotics will not thermally degrade. However, it is also important not to cool so much that the agar solidifies before the plates are poured.
*Pour or pipet ~20 mL of warm media into each plate. If using antibiotics, pouring can be done on the benchtop. If no antibiotics are used, then pour the plates in the Biosafety cabinet.
*After the agar has solidied, ~30 min, invert the plates (agar side up) and allow to dry on the benchtop for ~1-2 days.
*Use colored markers to label the plates.
**LB Agar = red
**LB-Amp = blue
**LB-Chl = red & blue
**LB-Kan = red & black
**LB-Tc  = red & green
