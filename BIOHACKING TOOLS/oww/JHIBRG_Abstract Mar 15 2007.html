Cystic fibrosis (CF) is recessive genetic disease. CF patients have mutations in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The most common mutant is DF508, which is degraded ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Recently, it was reported that when DF508 CFTR is rescued from ERAD, cholesterol distribution is disrupted. Lipid rafts are believed as having distinct roles in cells and cholesterol is a key component of lipid rafts. I made preliminary observation about lipid rafts and CFTR.
