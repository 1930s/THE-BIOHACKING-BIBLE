==PCR Results from 7/10==
Here are the results from the 24 PCR reactions we did [[IGEM:Harvard/2006/Cyanobacteria/Notebook/2006-7-10|yesterday]]. About 2/3 of the reactions used PCC 7942 DNA and [[IGEM:Harvard/2006/Cyanobacteria/PrimerDesign|Peng's primers]] for amplifying the ''KaiABC'' region. The rest were positive controls using BioBrick inserts and primers. 

It appears that the 2 mM Mg+ buffer produced the best results. We're not sure whether an annealing temperature of 55° or 65° produces better yield, since our 65° machine was accidentally misprogrammed.

Reactions 17 and 21 yielded bands in the 3kb region, which is the length of our ''KaiABC'' extract.

==Gel purification==
We extracted and purified the 3kb band from reactions 21. According to the nanodrop, we had a DNA concentration of 9.5 ng / µL.

==Second gel electrophoresis==
We ran a second gel electrophoresis with reactions 17 and 21 as backups in case our transformation failed (see next entry). The results are shown below. We extracted reaction 21 (third lane) and refrigerated it (it hasn't been purified yet).

==Transformation==
We ligated our purified DNA from reaction 21 with TOPO vectors, using Invitrogen's Zero Blunt PCR cloning kit (protocol [http://www.invitrogen.com/content/sfs/manuals/zeroblunttopo_man.pdf here]). Zero Blunt was used because Vent produces blunt-ended DNA. We then transformed the Topo vector + insert with TOP10 cells using the protocol described [[User:Kfifer#Transformation|here]], and incubated overnight, along with a positive and negative control.
