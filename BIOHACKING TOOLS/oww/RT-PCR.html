'''Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)''' is a [[PCR techniques|PCR technique]] using reverse transcribed mRNA (cDNA) as a template. It can be used to detect the presence of a type of mRNA. Quantification in addition to detection requires a different method called [[QRT-PCR]]. Do not confuse RT-PCR with real time PCR, which is unfortunately sometimes abbreviated as RT PCR.
