== Vesicles ==

'''Results''' <br>

Sample 8, produced on [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Notebook/2007-9-4 | 04.09.2007]] was looked at again under the fluorescence microscope, but this time only a single 2&mu;m vesicle was found.

'''Preparations''' <br>

Three POPC/dodecane 10ml suspensions were prepared.

==Cloning of Biobricks (for Maxiprep)==
#Placed 100 ml of LB in a 500 ml conical flask
#Innoculated 1 ml of culture into LB media in flask
#Incubated overnight at 37 Â°C

==Transformation of Biobricks==
#1 biobrick was transformed into XL1-Blue
#Cells were grown for half an hour and plated
#Plates were incubated at 37&deg;C overnight

*Transformed in XL1-Blue<font size=-2>
