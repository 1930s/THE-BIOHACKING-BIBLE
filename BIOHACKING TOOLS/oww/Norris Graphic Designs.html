==Jamboree Presentation==

My mock-ups for our project presentations. It can be presented during the Jamboree and accessed as a tutorial from the website. John had a good idea about constantly reminding our audience where all of this takes place and I tried to incorporate it. Hope you guys like.

==T-shirt Designs==
Yes it probably doesn't look anything like science but I have you all fooled. It's supposed to be a "streaked" bacterial colony plate encircled by DNA/plasmid. I tried to make something that appealed to college students.

*cool, I really like the big streak, no. 3, we should maybe think of something that could be used as a permanent logo, that we can just change the year each year.  Tito is also speaking to someone about a permanent logo.  --[[User:Johncumbers|Johncumbers]] 18:40, 22 June 2007 (EDT)
