Photoelectric Effect

Using PASCO Scientific AP-9368 h/e apparatus

Keithley 131 Digital Multimeter

===Purpose===
We are using the photoelectric effect to measure Planck's Constant. The photoelectric effect is when packets of light collide with a metal, and "pop" electrons off its surface. In our setup we use a photo diode. In the photo diode, these electrons pop off an anode then travel to a cathode. The electrons create a current, which is then stored in a capacitor. This charged capacitor creates the "stopping potential" that will eventually stop further electrons from getting to the anode. 

In the first part of the lab, we will measure the amount of time it takes for the light to go from 0V to 80% of stopping potential, at different wavelengths and intensities of light. This should help demonstrate the particle nature of light. (We use a % of the stopping potential since the real stopping potential is reached asymptotically){{SJK comment|label=01:22, 18 October 2007 (CDT)|comment=How does this demonstrate the particle nature of light? Could explain, especially when looking at the actual data recorded.}}

Lastly, using the stopping voltage, the wavelength of the light <math>\nu</math> and the equation <math>K=h \nu - \phi</math> we will plot our data and by finding the x intercept find the workfunction <math>\phi</math> and the slope will find Planck's Constant

===Procedure===
For the first part, we will flood the apparatus with different colors of light emitted from a lamp. Watching the voltmeter, we can find the maximum stopping potential of the photoelectroms emitted by certain colors of light. We will also use filters that decrease the intensity of the light and watch how long it takes the light to return from 0 to its maximum potential (since the max potetential is reached asymptotically, we decided to measure it at some fixed percenet of max).

===Data===
Note: Voltmeter has .04V as it's "zero"
====Experiment Part A====
Looking at particle nature of light
=====UV light===== 

100% filter Stopping Potential: 1.86V
measure at 90% about 1.70V

80% filter SP : 1.84V
90% of that 1.65V

60% filter SP : 1.81V
90% of that 1.63V

40% filter SP: 1.78V
90% of that: 1.60 V

20% filter SP:1.74 V
90% of that:1.57 V

Note: the neutral filter filters out some UV light
