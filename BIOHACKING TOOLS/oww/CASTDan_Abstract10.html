Abstract:

<br> Electrochemical sensors for pH and dissolved oxygen remain the
most commonly used in bioprocess monitoring, but continued
research has resulted in improved optical sensors. Optical
sensors for dissolved oxygen and dissolved carbon dioxide are
now commercially available. Advances in optics and electronics
are further driving down the costs of these sensors. In the near
future, bioprocess optimization will change paradigms as
massively parallel, fully instrumented bioreactors become
available and high-throughput bioprocessing becomes a reality.
