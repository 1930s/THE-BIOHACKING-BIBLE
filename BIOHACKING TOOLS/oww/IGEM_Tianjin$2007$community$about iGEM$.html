='''iGEM - The international Genetically Engineered Machine competition'''= 
iGEM addresses the question: Can simple biological systems be built from standard, interchangeable parts and operated in living cells? Or is biology simply too complicated to be engineered in this way? 
The only way to answer this is to actually try to engineer biological devices. 

The iGEM competition facilitates this by providing a library of standardized parts (we call these parts BioBricks) to students, and asking them to design and build genetic machines with them. Of course, students are welcome (and encouraged!) to make their own BioBricks as well.
