=="Fixing" several broken inverters==
We will demonstrate the utility of the [[PoPS device screening plasmid|screening plasmid]] for fixing "broken" inverters via directed evolution.  Preliminary results with the tetR-based inverter <bbpart>Q04400</bbpart> showed early success of this method.

==Procedure==
[[Endy:Library-based construction/Inverter library protocol]]

==Reshmaverters==
We are working with Reshma Shetty to test her new inverter designs.
