===Lots of algorithms available for generating random numbers from 0 to 1 with uniform probability===
===General case===
====Assume you have a random number r from 0 to 1.  To transform to x, with PDF given by P(x):====
:<math>r=\int_{X=-\infty}^{x} P(x)\, dx</math>
====Numerically solving for x gives random number with appropriate distribution.====
===Specific case, time for random event to occur (i.e. radioactive decay)===
:<math>P(t) = \frac {1}{\tau} e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}</math>
====Solving above,====
:<math>\ t_i = -\tau \ln r_i
