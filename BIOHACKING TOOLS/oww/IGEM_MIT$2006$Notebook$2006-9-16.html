===phase 1 [Stephen]===
*digest pSB1AC with EP '''-done'''
*digest WGD [resistance: a/k] (osmY.Q04400.J45119) with ES '''-done'''
*digest WGD (resistance: a/t) (J45120) with ES '''-done'''
*digest SAGD [resistance: a/t] (both 320 CA and 320 CB) with XP '''-done'''
*set up colony pcr of J45014 in yeast backbone (use special primers from samantha) '''-done'''
*start site-directed mutagenesis on all four J45398-pre mut parts '''-done'''

===phase 2 [Kate]===
*remove/heat shock digests '''-done'''
*PCR cleanup backbone digest '''-done'''
*make amp LCs for yeast colony PCRs '''-done'''
*ligate WGDs and SAGD with appropriate backbone! (try to find A/C) '''-done'''
*ligate ES digested FNosmy with XP cut 199 and 219 (199 and 219 are in A/K) '''-done'''
*start transformation '''-done'''
#'''NOTE:''' Hopefully everything will work. If the transformation fails, however, here are 2 possible reasons to consider ---> the EP cut backbone post-pcr cleanup only had a concentration of 12ng/&mu;L. Maybe something went wrong. Also, the Top10 cells that I used were ones that got thermocycled in the move to the freezer in old Endy Lab!! It is hard to find stuff up there, but I think that both of our main boxes got dumped and thermocycled. This pretty much sucks hard.

===phase 3 [Andre]===
*plate transformation ('''ready at 7pm''')
*Take out colony PCR (left block) & run a gel to see if any are right (should be ~1.6kb, might be 2.6kb)
#throw out bad LCs from 37 room (labeled 7A-H and 8A-H)
*mutagenesis dpnI digest and cleanup (right block)
