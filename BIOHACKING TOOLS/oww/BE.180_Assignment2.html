===Questions and Clarifications===
*Please put all class and function definitions at the beginning of the code. 
*Make sure you have TWO underscores before and after "init" in the constructor.
*You must use the exact variable names requested in the problem set.  If you do not, you will lose all points for that section of the problem.  
*Here's an example of how to call a class function: To get the ORF length for all inverters using the function given in Part IIIA, you could loop through each element in the list of inverter objects with counter i, and call the function using i.getORFLength().  Refer to page 5 of the pset so see why you are not passing in any arguments.
