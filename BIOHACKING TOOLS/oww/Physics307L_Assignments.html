==Individual Lab Summaries==
Individual lab summaries have a soft deadline of before you begin the subsequent lab.  You should write up the summary as a linked sub-page of your "Physics307L:People/Name" page.  See [[Physics307L:People/Koch|Koch's page]] for an example.

What is required in the lab summary?  Good question, I am hoping to write out more clear instructions, but for now, go here: [[Physics307L:People/Koch/Balmer|incomplete guidance for lab summaries]].  Also, you can ask me what I am looking for specifically with your lab!

==Formal lab report==
===Rough draft===
November 5 is the due date for a rough draft of your formal lab report.  Comments on your rough draft will let you know what you need to do to perfect your final report

===Final report===
The final report will be due the final week of regular classes.  The report will be completely electronic, on the wiki.
