* introns-middle
* spliceosomal introns

** interrupt coding genes
** cannot self-splice
** need spliceosome
* group II introns

** interrupt RNA genes ...
** self-splice
* Donor(GU)-BranchPoint(A)-Acceptor(AG)

** Wally Gilbert - News and Views - Genes and Pieces
** named introns
** predicted alternative splicing
** predicted domain shuffling
** role in increasing recomb
* Ford Doolittle (N&V 3 months later)
** 'like to argue that eukaryotic genome as genes in pieces is primitive form'
** argued introns early
* introns-early predictions
** intron positions correspond to protein structure
** exons are 3n basepairss
*** if add new exon in middle - causes frameshift
* introns late prediction
** spliceosomal system derived from group II introns (transferred from mitochondrion)
* data
** protein gene-structure corr p ~ 10^-10
** p-value exon length ~ 10^-10 (Arlin Stoltzfus group)
** similarity between spliceosome and type II introns - convinced of introns-late
* intron loss and gain
** no clear phylogenetic trend in intron contents
*** could be lots of intron gain, or loss - can't tell direction
* Coulomb-Huntigton, Majewski, PNAS, 2006
* 10-15% intron positions shared across fungi, animals and plants

* functional interpretations
** 'speed evolution' (Gilbert, 1978)
** mediate chromatin structure
** facilitate exon shuffling (Gilbert, 1986)
* prevent homogenization of orthologs
** represent a nexus of gene regulation
** facilitate nonsense-mediated decay (Lynch)
* Disruptive vs. Formative
** Disruptive: some point whole protein coding genes
*** some time introns split these
** Formative
*** assembly of exon coding mini-genes
** to distinguish, need homology in intron sequences
*** intron seq evolve rapidly
*** exon shuffling creates new chimeric genes
* generating predictions from the disruptive (insertional) model
** introns gained non-randomly wrt nucleotide sequence

=== Conclusions ===
* intron positions exhibit substantial corr with structural features
** sec struct, solvent acc strongest
* nucleotide model accounts for most of non-randomness
* sig deviations remained
