==Discussion==
* the first paper is history of a theoretical model of coupled oscillators called the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuramoto_model Kuramoto model], which demonstrates threshold phase-locking of individual oscillators to the average population phase. 
** the first 6 or so sections are a good introduction so I would recommend reading them.  Later sections give further analysis but it gets more complicated and i don't think it's as important for our interests.  we probably won't focus much on this for the meeting.
* the second paper analyzes a theoretical circuit for synchronizing populations of repressilators, demonstrating a phase transition similar to that seen in the Kuramoto model
