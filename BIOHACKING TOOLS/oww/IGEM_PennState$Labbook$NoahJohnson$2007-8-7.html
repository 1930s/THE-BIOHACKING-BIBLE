<h1>August 7, 2007</h1>

Ran a Touchdown PCR with Pfu and crp* with different amounts of template DNA added:
*0 (-)
*0.25uL
*1uL
*2uL

Also ran Taq with 1uL template DNA and a negative. Diluted primers 1:10 before adding.
Used protocol from July 25, 2007 PCR run.

Don't understand the gel at all. Negatives came up positive and Pfu positives didn't work. Must have made a mistake so i'm re-running a touchdown PCR with template DNA amounts of:
*0.001uL
*0.01uL
*0.1uL
*1uL
*10uL

Also ran a negative and Taq with 1uL template and a Taq negative. Let run overnight

9:30-5:30
