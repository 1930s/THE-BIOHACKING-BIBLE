*[[../Base-Pair Finder/]] - stores a sequence starting from x to y in a file
*[[../Count/]] - counts total number of amino acids/bp and tells what amino acid is present at a location. Eg you can find aa 251 with this
*[[../Optimal Codon Usage Writer/]] - given an amino acid sequence, it will reverse-translate to a DNA sequence with optimum codon usage for E. coli. Good for resolving issues with EcoR1 sites etc. (You should take protein sequence off GenBank)
