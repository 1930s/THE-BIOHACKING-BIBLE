==Debrief==

===Modelling===
*Got most equations for infector detector - up on the wiki
*Most simulations done
*Some problems, like with the constitutive promoter - will discuss with Captain ID and protocols team to resolve the issues
*Need to finish forming all the equations and highlight all the issues with the modelling of both ID and CBD by the end of the week

===Vessicles=== 
*Didn't form any vessicles today
*Got vessicles for sure, but GFP seems to be only around the membrane - possible reason: GFP was not put in the right quantity at the right step
*Will need to form vessicles again to verify

===Protocols===
*Reaction buffer needed for the home-made cell extract to work - ordered all the reagants
*Home-made cell extract tests put on hold - will carry on testing the DNA constructs in the commmercial one
*Tests will be done for pTet, PT7, GFP in vitro

===Lab team===
*IPTG solution made for the cell extract experiments
*Cloned a few more bricks, and re-cloned some that didn;t work earlier

===Weekly digest===
*Done and send to all the supervisors
