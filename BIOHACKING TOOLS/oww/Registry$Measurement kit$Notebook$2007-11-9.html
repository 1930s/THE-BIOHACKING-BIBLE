Diluted 1:1000 (5ul in 5 ml M9 media) in the morning after overnight growth.  Pre-warmed the M9 media before to counter temperature shock. 

Noticed a difference in color.  After 4.5 hours tubes 4 and 14 were noticeably more clear than all others.  Made plate per standard procedure. [http://openwetware.org/wiki/Registry/Measurement_kit/Protocols/Plate_reader_experiment]
