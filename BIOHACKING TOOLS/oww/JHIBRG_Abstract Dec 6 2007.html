'''''In vivo'' molecular-genetic imaging of cancer''' 

''In vivo'' molecular imaging can meet the needs for monitoring the localization of the distribution of therapeutic gene expression and the efficacy of gene therapy in a noninvasive and longitudinal way.  In this talk, I will introduce our novel strategy to drive the expression of the therapeutic gene specifically in cancer and to evaluate its efficacy by using the multimodal reporter gene-based imaging system.
