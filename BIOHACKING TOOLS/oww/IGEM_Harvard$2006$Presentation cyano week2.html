Think about these questions when preparing your project proposals for the group meeting.

For each project idea:

* '''What is the specific goal of the project?'''
**Populate Biobricks catalog
**Biobrick a KaiABC oscillator (for use in cyanobacteria AND/OR e. coli)
***[http://www.kazusa.or.jp/cyano/WH8102/cgi-bin/orfinfo.cgi?title=Chr&name=SYNW0548&iden=1 This site] shows the location of the kaiABC genes in WH8102 strain. 2.866kb for kaiABC + non-coding region.
***Research shows that the KaiABC proteins alone will oscillate ''in vitro'' (Nakajima et al. 2005)
**Test the oscillator in E. coli to create a "nightlight"
***Use a luciferase gene reporter, which was done in (Kondo et al. 2000)
***Also can measure KaiC activity; create a chimeric protein w/GFP
**Synthesis of ~3kb KaiABC w/ codon replacement of Ala of Leu to use in E. coli
***Estimated cost is $0.11/bp w/o error correction; $2/bp with error correction (Tian et. al 2004)
****But the Church lab has a better way of doing this?
***DNA synthesis provides a backup in case direct insert of KaiABC into E. coli fails
***There is a known codon bias problem with 2 amino acids (can't find source but I found it the other day): then, we can synthetically modify the codons for these 2 aa's to be compatible in e. coli
** '''Alternate phrasing, courtesy of Kit Parker - what is the "deliverable?" The thing you will point to and say "this is our project?"'''
***Our deliverable is a BioBrick part(s)
* '''What are two or three possible means of implementing the idea?'''
**Biobrick the cyanobacteria KaiABC
**Insert directly into E. coli to create a "nightlight"
**Synthesize E. coli compatible KaiABC and implement in E. coli
**Create a circuit with other BioBricks
**Last resort: Just create a cyanobacteria "nightlight" if all E. coli steps fail
* '''Risk'''
** '''How many untested things have to work for the project to succeed?'''
***Should work unless something in E. coli causes it not to
****Reporter gene should have no problem
***Codon bias may be a problem
***More proteins may be involved than KaiABC
****But KaiABC have been shown to work ''in vitro''
***Transcription regulation of the KaiABC proteins
****We know that KaiA mRNA remains constant as KaiC fluctuates (Wang et. al 2005)
** '''How will you test whether those things work or not?'''
***If we don't get results / alternative methods such as synthesis
** '''How will you adjust your plan when one of these things fails to work?'''
***We have backup plans, such as only implementing a "nightlight" in cyanobacteria
** '''How will you minimize the time/effort/resources lost to a failed design?'''
*** '''Can your time/effort/resources apply to more than one design simultaneously?'''
* '''Reward'''
** '''How cool, fun, exciting is the project for you?'''
***It's cool, fun, AND exciting!
** '''What if any is the usefulness or societal benefit of the project?'''
***Clock oscillator
****Can experimentally vary the period of the oscillator from 14h to 60h (Kondo et. al 2000) with KaiC point mutations
****Can further discretise by half
***A bacterial "timer"
***Could be used as a clock for gene circuits, analogous to a clock signal ''in silico'' (but may be too slow)
***Nightlight
** '''What is going to impress the judges in November?'''
*** Biobricks part!
* '''Timeline'''
** '''What are the project milestones? (design, construction, testing)'''
**#Getting ''WH8102'' strain of cyanobacteria ''1-2 wks''
**#*Prof. Wang at Yale wrote a review, so he may know how to obtain this strain - we will contact him
**#*Otherwise we may have to take a field trip to tour Japan, or check papers for sources
**#*'''EDIT''': Strain PCC7942 works also; MIT says it is the model system for studying circadian rhythm; [http://cyano.genome.jp/cgi-bin/CYORF_open_Search_list.pl?OPE_ITEM=near_gene&OPE_VALUE=5&ANNID=Synpcc7942_1218&SEARCH_ITEM=accession&ORG_TYPE=syf&ORG=syf] has the location for KaiA, B, C. Will email people for these two strains.
**#Creating a cyanobacteria biobrick / extracting KaiABC genes ''1-2 wks''
**#*Designing primers can be done beforehand
**#Designing a feasible E. coli version of KaiABC (can be done simultaneously with step 1) ''1-2 wks''
**#*Research into the necessary modifications
**#*Making the modifications of the 3kb sequence (should be fast)
**#*Send to synthesize
**#Implementing into E. coli both versions ''Long time (5wk+)''
**#*Design either chimeric protein or luciferase (Perry?)
**#*Implementation and testing
** '''What is the estimated time required for each? (always overestimate)'''
** '''If you can't reach your ultimate goal by August, is there a satisfying intermediate goal?'''
***We WILL create a biobricked part that works for cyanobacteria at least
***And if worse comes to worse we'll make a cyanobacteria nightlight
** '''What is the immediate next step in pursuing the project?'''
***See steps 1 and 3 above
*** '''If DNA synthesis will be required, how soon will you have the sequence designed?'''
****1-2 weeks
