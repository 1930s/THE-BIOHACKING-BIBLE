===Summary===

OADC is Oleic Acid Albumin Dextrose Complex, a component of the mycobacterial selective media 7H9 and 7H10.  If you don't add the oleic acid solution, then this is ADS, used for ''M. smegmatis'' culture in 7H9.

===Ingredients===

* deionized water
* 8.5g NaCl
* 50g Bovine serum albumin fraction V
* 20g D-dextrose
* 50mL 1% [[McKinney:SodiumOleate|sodium oleate solution]] (for ''M. tuberculosis'' only)

===Protocol===

# Combine 925mL deonized water and 8.5g NaCl in a 2L flask.  Stir with a magnetic stirbar until salt is dissolved.
# Add 50g bovine serum albumin fraction V and stir until completely dissolved.
# Add 20g dextrose, and stir until completely dissolved.
# Add 50mL 1% sodium oleate solution, and stir until completely mixed.  The pH should now be ~6.9-7.0.  Filter through Whatman #3 paper to remove particulates.  Filter sterilize through 0.22&mu;m pore filter.  Store at 4&deg;C.
