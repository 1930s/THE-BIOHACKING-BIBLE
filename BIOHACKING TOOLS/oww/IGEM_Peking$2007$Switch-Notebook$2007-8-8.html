==Colony PCR==
T1TE-plx010 using the primer T1TE-F/R

result: not very good, the T1TE fragment seems to be smaller than expected.

GFP-plx003 using GFP-F/R

result: GFP colony PCR has no positive control result. So other results are not reliable.

==T1T2-pcc010 and GFP-plx007 rescue==
after rescue and inactivation, ligate those two together using a ratio of 4:1.

After ligation, transformed to DH5a and smeared onto LB plate with right antibiotics

==Colony PCR of T1TE-plx010==
primer: test-F/lazZa-R
positive and negative control: plx010
GFP-plx003 using test-F/R and control for plx003 plasmid

==Miniprep of T1-T6 and T1TE-pcc010==
double digestion using KpnI and XhoI
failed in the digestion.
