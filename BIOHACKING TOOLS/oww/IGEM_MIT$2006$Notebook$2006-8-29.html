#analyze sequencing results mid-morning '''- done'''
#*then miniprep/sequence all new rbs.pchBA.term LCs that could still possibly have R0011 attached and throw out bad '''- all failed to attach an rbs, so are starting over assembly from pchBA.Term-mut glycerol that we think is correct'''
#*check for which osmY-Q-J.xxx structures look good and throw out bad '''- incomplete sequencing results, but O-Q-119B is good and potentially O-Q-199A is too'''
#glycerol pE3/pE3R (plus miniprep) and YYC912 IK strain '''- done, but pE3 had a low miniprep concentration'''
#glycerol with nice labels, miniprep, sequence final bb-construct parts (6) to doublecheck their integrity '''- done, but realized that the J45396 is not a mutagenized construct - made a new correct LC'''
#make iGEM yeast LC (one big for pelleting/baking and one small for miniprepping/digesting/ligating)  '''- done, and bread machine has arrived'''
#3-part assemble/transform B0015 with the 2 correctly mutagenized/ES digested 30.Bat2.30.THI3 '''- done'''
#add methyl salicylate to pseudomonas cells (if grown-up enough) and see if it is readily degraded '''- done'''

==today's time line==
#first: remove all LCs
#second: analyze sequencing
#third: minipreps and glycerols
#fourth: sequencing
#fifth: ligations/transformations
