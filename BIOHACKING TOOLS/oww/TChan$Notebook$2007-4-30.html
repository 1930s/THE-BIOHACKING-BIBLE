===[http://news.google.com/intl/en_us/terms_google_news.html Google News]===

This agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into by and between you ("you") and Google, Inc., ("Google") regarding your use of all aspects of Google News (the "Service"). By using the Service, you consent to be bound by these terms and conditions as well as Google's general Terms of Service (available at http://www.google.com/terms_of_service.html) and Google's general Privacy Policy (available at http://www.google.com/privacy.html).

1. Rights Associated with the Service. The Service is designed to help you find news information that resides on sites not owned or controlled by Google. In particular, the Service provides brief descriptions of news stories to help you identify the stories of interest to you. When you select a story, you will be linked to the news site on which that story appears. Google owns and retains all intellectual property rights to the Service; but Google does not claim ownership rights to the full news stories, which are instead held by the sites to which the Service links.

2. Use of the Service. You may only display the content of the Service for your own personal use (i.e., non-commercial use) and may not otherwise copy, reproduce, alter, modify, create derivative works, or publicly display any content. For example, you may not use the Service to sell a product or service; use the Service to increase traffic to your Web site for commercial reasons, such as advertising sales; take the results from the Service and reformat and display them, or use any robot, spider, other device or manual process to monitor or copy any content from the Service. If you are uncertain whether your intended use of the Service is permissible, please contact us. In addition, Google shall have the right in its sole discretion to suspend or terminate the Service or your access to it.

3. Modifications of Terms. Google shall have the right to modify the terms of this Agreement at any time, which modification shall be effective immediately upon posting. Accordingly, we suggest that you check this page periodically. To make your review more convenient, we will post a version number or date at the bottom of this page. These terms may also be modified by separate agreement between you and Google.

4. Miscellaneous. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed superseded by a valid enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remaining provisions shall be enforced. Google's failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive Google's right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. The failure of Google to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these terms and conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. This agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California.
