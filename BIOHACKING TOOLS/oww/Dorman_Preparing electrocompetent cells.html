This is a quick and dirty protocol.  I use it to make <i>E. coli</i> or <i>Salmonella</i> to which I want to introduce plasmid that I've already cloned.  This means that I'm adding a large amount of supercoiled plasmid to the cells, so the efficency doesn't need to be great.

'''Day 0:'''
#Grow the strain of interest overnight on L


'''Day 1:'''

#Add 100 &mu;L of the overnight culture to 10 mL of L in a 250 mL flask.
#Grow this to an OD<sub>600</sub> of around 0.5
#While the cells are growing, chill around 20 mL of ddH<sub>2</sub>0.  If the centrifuges (both bucket and microcentrifuge) aren't chilled, turn them on now.
#Harvest the cells by spinning at 4000 rpm for 10 min at 4&deg;C.  From here on out, you want to leave your cells on ice.
#Pour off the supernatant, and resuspend in 10 mL water.  I resuspend by pipetting- something that we wouldn't do if we were being careful and wanted really high efficency.  Leave the cells on ice for at least 20 min- longer is fine.
#Spin again for 10 min to pellet the cells.  Put a 1.7 mL tube on ice.
#Resuspend in 1mL of water (I use a cut off p1000 tip for this) and transfer to the chilled tube.
#Spin for 5min at 6000 rpm to pelet.
#Repeat the above two steps two more times.
#After this final spin, resuspend in cells in 200 μL water.  These cells are ready to electroporate.
#Mix 1&mu;L of plasmid with 40 μL of cells and electroporate them.
#Add 1 mL of L to the cuvette, and let the cells recover at 37&deg;C for 1 hour.
#Plate 100 &mu;L onto approprate selective media.  


'''Day 2:'''

#Check your plates.  I typically get between 100 and 1000 colonies.
