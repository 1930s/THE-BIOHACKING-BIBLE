==Joining our group==
POSTDOCS, GRADUATE STUDENTS AND UNDERGRADUATES

We welcome people from diverse scientific backgrounds at any level.  If you are interested in becoming a member of our group as a Postdoctoral Fellow, please send a cover letter and a copy of your CV by email to [http://openwetware.mit.edu/index.php?title=User:PamSilver Pam Silver].  We anticipate openings for Postdoctoral Fellows in the coming months (see [http://openwetware.org/wiki/Silver:_Open_Positions OPEN POSITIONS] for  more information).  For interested graduate students, please just send an email.  We welcome graduate students from all Harvard DMS and FAS programs including BBS, Biophysics,Chemical Biology and Systems Biology.  We also welcome visiting graduate and undergraduates from other Universities throughout the world.

==Reagent Requests==
For strain requests, please give as much detail as possible such as strain number, plasmid number, or reference.  Please send your request by email together with an account number if you wish to have it sent by express mail.  If you wish to have it sent by express mail but do not have an account or cannot afford it - please say so and we will still process your request.  Your request will be forwarded to someone in the lab and sent as soon as possible.  We are commited to sending out all published reagents, any parts in the [http://parts.mit.edu/ Registry of Standard Biological Parts] made in our lab, and in many cases just about anything else - just ask!  If you wish to use a reagent that we have sent to another lab, that's fine too - we wouldn't mind getting an email just so we have a record of who is using what in case we can't find something or someone else at your Institution requests the same reagents.  Thanks!

Some plasmids can be obtained through [http://www.addgene.org Addgene], a not for profit service.
