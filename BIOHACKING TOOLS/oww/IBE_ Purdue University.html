'''Purdue University Institute of Biological Engineering Student Chapter'''

== Our mission==

Purdue IBE strives to unite students - from multiple majors - interested in Biological Engineering by providing contact and affiliation with a professional society. The department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering serves at the home department for the club, but students from all related majors can be and are members. 

'''Current majors represented include:'''

*Agricultural and Biological Engineering
*Biochemistry
*Biomedical Engineering
*Chemistry
*Genetic Biology

==Our history==

Purdue IBE chapter began as an iGEM team in 2006.  The team formed a student club named "Biological Engineering in Genetics" or BEG (named for their ineterests and their need for research funds).  BEG was formed because the students wanted to expand the activities beyond iGEM. In 2007 BEG decided that a national affiliation with IBE would help to fulfill this objective.

== Student Officers==
*President:  John Schumm
