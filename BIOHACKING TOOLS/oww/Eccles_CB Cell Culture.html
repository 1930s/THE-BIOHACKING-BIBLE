=Culturing CB Cells (Mouse Embryonic Kidney Cells)=

==Background==
These cell lines were made from e18.5 mouse embryonic kidneys of various pkd1, pax2 and immorto genotypes.<br>
Refer to ([http://www.openwetware.org/wiki/Eccles:Making_Primary_Cells_from_Tissue Making Primary Cells from Mouse Tissue protocol]) for details on how this was done. <br>
We were aiming for epithelial cells (particularly of the collecting duct) positive for the SV40 large T "immorto" gene that were either wt, pkd1-/-, pkd1-/- pax2+/- or pax2+/- in genotype.  Some epithelial-like cells from mouse embryos that were immorto positive were cloned using cloning rings and bulked up at the permissive temperature of 33 degrees C in the presence of interferon-gamma.  All cells stemming from cloned cells are designated with "ex cloned".   During the first passage of cells not cloned we found that the fibroblast-like cells were more sensitive to trypsinisation than the epithelial-like cells meaning they would lift off after 2-3mins whereas the epithelial-like cells required 5mins to lift.  To enrich for epithelial-like cell populations we performed differential trypsinisation.  The lifted fibroblast-like cells were frozen down and are designated as "fib lift or lifted cells".  The epithelial-like cells enriched by differential trypsinisation are designated with "differential lift eps"<br>
All cell lines designated with "ex 33'C" have been grown at 33 degrees C with interferon-gamma (and are immorto positive).  Those without this designation have been established at 37 degrees C only.<br>
The cell lines that have been cloned are CB163E4 (IM+ pkd1-/- pax2+/+), CB167E3 (IM+ pkd1-/- pax2+/+) and CB167E2 (IM+ pkd1-/- pax2+/-).  Note that the early passages are pre-cloning and contain a mixed population of cells.  Remember all cells stemming from cloned cells are designated with "ex cloned".  Future cloning can be performed on any of the passage 0 cells frozen down.<br>
Some immorto positive cells have been grown at 33'C for various analyses that are not cloned such as the wt lines.<br>
All cells were grown on collagen coated plates unless otherwise indicated eg: by "plastic".  Some cells are designated with "2nd plating".  This means that 24h-48h post initial plating of the cells the non-adhered cells were replated on a new cell culture vessel surface.  The cells that successfully established were plated onto plastic (no collagen coating).  These cells should now be grown on collagen coated cell culture vessels.<br>

===Interferon-gamma===
* When culturing cells in SV40 large T antigen up-regulation conditions (33 degrees C) add interferon-gamma to a final concentration of 10units/mL in cell culture media.
* Cells are grown at 33 degrees C with interferon-gamma at 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.  If you wish to down-regulate SV40 large T antigen expression, replace media with that not containing interferon-gamma and grow cells at 37 degrees C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

===Trypsinisation===
*Some of the cell lines are quite difficult to trypsinise.
*Aspirate media from cells in dish.
*Add warmed trypsin to cells and incubate at 33 degrees C for 5min.
*Pipette trypsin up and down in dish to remove cells from the dish surface and add to media (5% FCS, no additives), (3-4x volume of trypsin used) in 15ml tube. Can rinse dish with media and add to tube to maximise cell recovery.
*DO NOT trypsinise for longer.  This destroys cell integrity.  I have tried 7.5mins and 10mins and both led to the cells becoming sticky and sparse.
*Pellet cells at 250g, 5mins.
*Aspirate off media.
*Resuspend cells in suitable volume of warmed media + additives.
* Split cells 1:6 maximum.



===Freezing Down Cells===
*Trypsinise cells as usual
*Pellet cells at 250g, 5 minutes.
*Aspirate off media/trypsin.
*Resuspend cells gently in (usually 1ml per cryovial);<br>
65% media<br>
25% FCS<br>
10% DMSO<br>

*Aliquot cells into labelled cryovials.
*Place cryovials in Frosty Boy and place at -80.
*Transfer cells to liquid nitrogen dewar next day.
*Update cell line dewar record on wiki.



===Getting Cells up from Freeze Down===
*Defrost cells by placing vial at 37 degrees C (water bath) until there is a small lump of ice left.
*Spray vial with ethanol, wipe and place vial in cell culture hood. Pipette contents into 5mls warmed media (5% FCS, no additives) in 15ml tube (by this time cells will be completely defrosted).
*Pellet cells at 250g, 5mins.
*Aspirate off freeze media/media mix.
*Resuspend cells in suitable volume of warmed media + additives and seed onto collagen coated dish.
*This method means you don't need to change media next day.



===Handy Hint===
*When inactivating trypsin or getting cells up from freeze down use DMEM/F-12 1:1 containing 5% FCS and pen strep so that you don't waste media with additives.



===Media Additive Preparation===

====Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium (100x)====
Insulin-transferrin-selenium, 10mL, Invitrogen #41400-045<br>
Store at 4 degrees C<br>
Ready to use<br>


====Dexamethasone (20ug/mL)====
Dexamethasone, 1mg, Sigma #D8893<br>
Lyophilised reagent stored at 4 degrees C<br>

* Dissolve 1mg dexamethasone in 1mL of absolute ethanol to give a 1mg/mL solution
* Dilute 1:50 by adding 49mL media (DMEM/F-12 1:1 without additives) to give a final stock concentration of 20ug/mL
* Aliquot and store at -20
* Use between 20-200ng/mL final (50-500uL in 50mL media)


====Triiodotyronine (20ug/mL)====
Triiodotyronine, 1mg, Sigma #T5516<br>

* Dilute 1mg in 1mL sterile 1M NaOH. 
* Dilute 1:50 by adding 49mL media (DMEM/F-12 1:1 without additives) to give a final stock concentration of 20ug/mL
* Aliquot and store at -20
* Use between 0.6-6ng/mL final (1.5-15ul in 50mL media


====Murine Epidermal Growth Factor====
mEGF, 0.1mg, Sigma #E4127

* Add 1mL media containing 10% FCS (0.9mL DMEM/F-12 1:1 without additives + 0.1ml FCS)
* Aliquot into 6uL lots to avoid freeze/thawing
* Store at -20 
* 0.1mg/mL stock solution is stable for up to 2 weeks at 4 degrees C once made up
* Use between 2-20ng/mL final (1-10ul in 50mL media)


====Interferon-gamma, mouse recombinant====
0.1mg, Sigma #I4777

After contacting Sigma technical help I identified that this batch of interferon-gamma contained not less than 1x10<sup>6</sup> units<br>
It seems that with any new batch of IFN-gamma ordered in one would need to check this (details didn't come with IFN-gamma)<br>

* Make 1mg/mL solution in 1x PBS (0.1mg in 0.1mL of 1x PBS).  This gives a 1x10<sup>7</sup>U/mL solution.
* Further dilute in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) no additives containing 10% FCS to 1x10<sup>5</sup>U/mL.
* Aliquoted into 100uL lots and stored at -20.
* Each time a 1x10<sup>5</sup>U/mL. aliquot is thawed it will need to be further diluted 1/10 to 1x10<sup>4</sup>U/mL in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) no additives containing 10% FCS.
* Aliquot 1x10<sup>4</sup>U/mL interferon-gamma  and store at -20 to prevent repeated freeze/thawing.
* Once thawed the interferon-gamma solution is stable for 1 week at 4 degrees C
