==Construction of pT7-GFP==
#5 colonies grew in the ligation plate
#All 5 colonies were picked and each was grown in 5 ml of LB + Kan
#The 5 cultures were incubated at 37&deg;C overnight

==Cloning of Biobricks (for Maxiprep)==
#Placed 200 ml of LB in a 500 ml conical flask
#Innoculated 2 ml of culture into LB media in flask
#Incubated overnight at 37 Â°C
