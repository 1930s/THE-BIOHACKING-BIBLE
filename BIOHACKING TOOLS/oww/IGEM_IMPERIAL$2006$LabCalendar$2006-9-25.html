 <u>'''TO DO:'''</u>
 *Miniprep of J37024 and J37031 (from the o/n ligations)
 *Ligations and Electroporations: 
     J37022 (AiiA test construct)
     J37025 (to be used to construct the final poly/monocistronic predator parts)
     J37018 (to be used to construct the final monocistronic predator part)
     J37020 (the polycistronic prey test construct)  
 </font color>

==Minipreps==

*J37024 colonies 2 and 3 successful (colony 1 unsuccessful)
*J37031 all three colonies successful

==Ligations and Electroporations==

*Ligation set up today. 
*Dr. Mann said he'd transform if he was still around later today or else he'll do it tomorrow...things are looking up, we may get our test construct yet.

==Cre-Lox==

*Using new blunt-end kit, the ligation of the Cre-Lox part into a blunt-ended plasmid
*Left to ligate overnight
