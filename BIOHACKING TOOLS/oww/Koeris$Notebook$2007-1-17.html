Standard heat shock protocol usable for any kind of origin. Also good for multi-plasmid transformations
==Reagents necessary==
*Chemically competent cells (see [[Koeris/Notebook/2007-1-8 | here]]) 
*Plasmid prep >5ng/ul concentration as the lower limit is acceptable
*SOC
==Protocol==
#Thaw competent cells on ice
#Add plasmid DNA to cell, stir with pipette tip, do NOT pipette up and down
#Incubate for 30min on ice
#Heat shock at 42 deg C for 30s
#Cool on ice for 5min
#Add 1ml SOC to 100ul competent cells
#Incubate at 37 deg C for 1h at 300rpm
#Spread plate 550ul on LB agar with the appropriate resistance markers
