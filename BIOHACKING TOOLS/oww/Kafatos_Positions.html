==Research Associate x2==
''(Salary in the range of £23,560 to £29,170 per annum) ''

Two Research Associate positions are available in the Immunogenomics laboratory of Prof. Fotis C. Kafatos and Dr. George K. Christophides, whose work encompasses innate immunity and functional genomics of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae.  

===Position 1 – 3 years===
<blockquote>
A highly motivated and experienced Research Associate is required to on a BBSRC-funded Research Project that focuses on the genomic analysis of NF-kappaB signalling in the malaria mosquito A. gambiae. The successful candidate will employ functional genomic technologies toward a better understanding of NF-kappaB signalling in A. gambiae. Genome-wide RNAi screens and DNA microarrays in combination with other functional genomic assays will be used to reveal essential players of NF-kappaB signalling pathways and detect targets of NF-kappaB transcription factors in the mosquito genome, illuminating the genetic networks that underpin defence reactions during microbial and parasitic infections. Putative evasion of the mosquito immune responses by Plasmodium parasites through suppression of NF-kappaB signalling will be specifically addressed. 

Candidates should hold a PhD in Cell and Molecular Biology or in a similar field and have an established track record of publications in peer reviewed journals. Previous experience in molecular and cell biology, functional genomics and high throughput techniques such as DNA microarrays and proteomics is required. Additional experience in insect genetics and innate immunity is desirable and be able to demonstrate excellent organisational, communication and interaction skills and also advanced computer literacy. 
</blockquote>

===Position 2 – Until 30 June 2007,   with the possibility of a further extension===
<blockquote>
A position has become available for a highly motivated Research Associate in a project focusing on the innate immune system of the malaria mosquito A. gambiae. The project aims to understand aspects of the mosquito innate immune system, in particular its interactions with the rodent and human malaria parasites capitalizing on the genome sequence of A. gambiae and on postgenomic tools such as transcriptome and single nucleotide polymorphisms analyses, transgenesis and gene silencing.  

The successful candidate will be a skilled molecular biologist with a PhD in Cell and Molecular Biology or a similar field and have an established track record of publications. He or she will be experienced in biochemical and protein analysis, including 2D-PAGE, mass spectrometry and protein expression. A strong background in cell culture techniques and reporter gene assays as well as confocal and fluorescence microscopy skills are also required. Additionally, the successful applicant will have experience in innate immunity as well as in working with insects, including manipulation, trangenesis and fine tissue dissection. Additionally, she/he must be able to demonstrate excellent computer literacy, communication and interaction skills.
