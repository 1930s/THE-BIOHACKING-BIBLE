*‘semantically extends’ RDF to enable us to talk about classes of resources, and the properties that will be used with them
*provides the means to describe application specific RDF vocabularies
*provides schema information as additional descriptions of resources, but does not prescribe how these descriptions should be used by an application
*describes classes (corresponds to the generic concept of a Type or Category) and properties

RDF schemas differ somewhat from XML schemas (such as DTDs or W3C XML Schemas) in that they do not define a permissible syntax but instead classes, properties, and their interrelation: they operate directly at the data model level, rather than the syntax level
