== How to use the Wiki and create pages ==

When you make the links for the wiki pages, please follow this example:

'''<nowiki>[[/Link_to_page | Name of Page]]</nowiki>'''
This appears as:
[[/Link_to_page | Name of Page]]


An actual link would look like this in wiki code:
'''<nowiki>[[/Fluorescence_Complementation | Team 1: Fluorescence Complementation]]</nowiki>'''
Here's what this turns into:
[[/Team_1:_Fluorescence_Complementation | Team 1: Fluorescence Complementation]]


How to add Links:

'''<nowiki>
[[Media:BrowniGEM_7-18-07.ppt]]</nowiki>'''
This appears as
