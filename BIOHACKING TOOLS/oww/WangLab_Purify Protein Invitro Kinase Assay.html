== Purify Protein Invitro Kinase Assay ==


=== Measure protein expression with absorbance spectrum: ===
#Set up the configuration, including scale, spectrum, 400-650 should be enough for FRET indicators.
#Clean the asymmetric tube (all crystal).
#Add blank solution, hit Zero, hit baseline.
#Add 1ml indicator solution, hit start, save the data file *.dsw in the correct directory.


=== Purify Protein and In vitro kinase assay: ===

#Transform PRSET plasmids to JM109 (DE3) (from Promega). 
#Under ex 480, green gargo, pick up bright colonies. 
#put in 2ml 100uM amp LB medium, o/n shake 250rpm 37oC.
#take bacteria medium, put in 100ml 100uM amp LB medium, shake 250rpm, 2-4hr, monitor the OD 600 reading, 0.2-0.4, dilute into (+400ml) 500ml 100uM amp LB medium, add 0.4mM IPTG to induce, shake o/n, RT, with air venturation. 
#spin down 7000rpm, 10min. 
#add 15 ml bper+0.5 protease coctail tablet+100uM PMSF, completely suspend gently, gentle rock at RT 10min, covered with foil.
#spin 15000rpm 15 min. filter through (optional). Add Ni-NTA agarose beads 1ml , gentle rock at RT 1hr. 
#prepare the column, rinse with 2x10ml 1xTNS, 50mM Tris,HClph=7.4, 300mM NaCl.
#Rinse 1x10ml 50mM Tris,HClph=7.4, 300mM NaCl, 10mM imidazole.
#elute with 1x10ml 50mM Tris,HClph=7.4, 300mM NaCl, 100mM imidazole.
#dialysis the protein solution 4oC, 4hr-o/n, in 50 mM Tris pH 8, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 2mM DTT. 10x Src kinase buffer stock solution: 500 mM Tris pH 8, 1 M NaCl, 100 mM MgCl2, dilute 10x, add 1:1000 2M DTT.
#Measure the absorbance following the above protocol.
#YFP (extinction coefficient) EC=77000 M-1 CM-1 , CFP EC=32500 M-1 CM-1, GFP EC=62000 M-1 CM-1. So Concentration=reading/EC

=== In vitro kinase assay ===
#Find the 3-way cuvette. Side line facing the emission, small aligned holes for excitation. Clean the cuvette.
#add 100 ul of indicator solution
#put in the holder and cover the cover. Make sure to ajust the aperture to ex=0.5-1 and em=0.5-1
#Hit F10, select HV#950 ON and HV#440 ON.
#Define Exp.
