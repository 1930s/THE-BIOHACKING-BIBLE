=Lock & Key By Yu Tao=
*First, I am going to fill in the missing Lock & Key notebooks today. Fighting!
*Secondly, I suggest Yang Yifan try to begin the Lock & Key Efficiency Test these days. Now that we have Key1-Lock1-double-plasmid clones, Lock1 clones and also Key1-Lock2-double-plasmid clones, we are able to test the real time efficiency of Lock1 and Key1 as well as the cross effect between Lock2 and Key1.
*Last, if the newly ligated plasmids of R0010<-J01008 are still negative, Yang, please do not hesitate to send the order of di-divided  J01008 primer to Invitrogen.
