==To do==
#Gradient scarring PCR on E0240 (and I2055) and run gel (done)
#Spin down device cultures/replate (done)
#Run gel on PCR product from yesterday (done)
#Cleanup yesterday's digests and PCR products (done. in Measurement Kit box)
#Make new Tet plates (done)
==Preparation of 3K3==
*Mini-prepped remaining 4mL of 3K3 (glycerol) culture
**Concentration was 44.1 ng/µL
*Digest of 3K3 running overnight.
*(23µL DNA + 19.5µL H2O)
==Analysis of PCR of I2055==
*Gel had no band.
*Will do gradient with E0240
==RFP Device cultures==
*RBS tester had one colony; others had no growth.
*made overnight culture to look at tomorrow
==Gradient PCR==
*Running gel with 2 20-lane rows:
#E0240 _ L _ _ 1 2 3 ... _ L _ _
#I2055 &nbsp;&nbsp;_ _ L _ 1 2 3 ... _ _ L _
