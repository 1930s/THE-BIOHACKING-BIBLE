Yup, Beth Toener would be proud.

==Submission Procedures and Internal Protocols here at the UC Davis!==
# To get [[Davis Sequencing Center Submission| sequence from a few samples]] try [Davis Sequencing Center]
# For more than 30 samples it is more economical to use the Genomics Facility run by Doug Cook and compatriots.
## We do sequencing direct from PCR products via an [[Exo Sap]] treatment prior to submission
## [[CGF Submission]] is relatively straightforward but requires that you set up an account with them.
# There are off campus options including Robert Tran of the Davis Tilling Facility's favorite at [[Rob Tran's Favorite sequencing]]
