I obtained my PhD researching  ‘Polymorphisms of the equine MHC’ from The University of Liverpool, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Large Animal Hospital. May 2000 – Dec 2003. I also graduated from the University of Liverpool with M.Sc Industrial Biotechnology between September 1996 -September 1997 and B.Sc (Honours) Biochemistry,October 1993 – July 1996.
My current research interests include investigating the role of candidate genes in the aetiology of Fibrotic disorders. 
I am an experienced post-doctoral research scientist with a broad understanding of molecular biology techniques.  I am interested in the development and implication of novel scientific procedures and technologies in relation to understanding  the aetiology of keloid disease and Dupuytren’s diseas.

I am currently investigating the protein expression profiles in keloids and Dupuytren’s using 2-D gel and mass spectrometric analysis.
