I am a Post-Doctorate Associate at Chris Burgeâ€™s lab at MIT pursuing better understanding of mechanisms governing microRNA regulation and function.

See my [http://web.mit.edu/nshomron/www homepage]

My interests and goals lie within seeking better understanding of the mechanisms governing regulation of gene expression on the RNA level, in particular, regulation by microRNAs and also alternative splicing. I would like to decipher the role these processes play in molding the transcriptome and proteome and thus affect cellular fate during states of health and disease.

I explore microRNA and splicing regulation using bench work, computational biology and high-throughput techniques. I focus on several aspects that together shed light on these small non-coding RNAs and their roles in molecular biology and evolution. On the miRNA annotation level, I complemented the miRNA registry (miRbase) with hundreds of mammalian high-confidence miRNA homologs and looked into their genomic organization and regulation. Regarding miRNA roles, I proposed a new function for miRNAs in buffering developmental related gene expression and I linked miRNA regulation to oncofetal genes relevant to human cancer. For miRNA targeting, I deciphered determinants of targeting by endogenous (and exogenous) miRNAs (also applicable to siRNAs).
