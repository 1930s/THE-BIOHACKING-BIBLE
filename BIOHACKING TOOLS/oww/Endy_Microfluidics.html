This is the portal for information about microfluidics in the Endy lab.  We are not equipped to fabricate our own chips, however we do have the [[Endy:Microfluidic Setup|required equipment]] to operate a PDMS microfluidic chip.  We currently have our chips fabricated by the [[KNI Microfluidic Foundry]].  Get in touch with [[Jason Kelly|Jason]] or [[Ty Thomson|Ty]] for more information.
