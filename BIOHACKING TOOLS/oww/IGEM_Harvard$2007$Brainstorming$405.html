==Project Ideas from Second Meeting (04/05/07)==
Additional notes added by Stephanie; please contact her with questions.

* Selection mechanisms for key/lock riboregulators (see 2006 Berkeley Project)
- Though sequence complementary is necessary, which allows little variation in that region, the rest of the RNA might differ
<br> - The RNA acts as a "key" to release the lock; only when both are present, allows for expression
<br> - This can allow for creation of networks, if the expression "unlocked" is for another key
<br> - Monitored by Red Fluorescent Protein, experimentally
<br> - Advantage = fast response
<br> - Can be used for either activation or inhibition
<br> - Suggestion: look into the Duke group: human encryption<br>

* Biofuel & light sensitive proton pump ([[Background_Reading|see background reading #3]]) (Pseudomonas Putida for exportation of short chain alkanes)

* Powering medical devices
- Bacteria that can extract energy from sugars in blood and convert these to electricity
<br> - Question posed: how often do the devices need energy? A: Depends on specific devices
<br> - Related idea: implantable devices that release, or even synthesize, drugs
<br>
* Artificial cells

* Use of psuedomonas putida? (bacterial strain)
- High tolerance to many saturated alkanes (can we get it to form octane?)
<br> - Issue: export vs. metabolism

* Quorum sensing and biofilms

* Mirror image proteins

* Nonribosomal synthesis of proteins

* Radon sensor (practical considerations of working with Radon)

<br> Short discussion of project logistics: rather than attempting to tackle multiple projects at once (as we will tend to be overambitious!), perhaps we can propose a sequence of experiments that we would like to attempt over the summer. We should treat these as 'checkpoints' and finish one before proceeding to the next.
