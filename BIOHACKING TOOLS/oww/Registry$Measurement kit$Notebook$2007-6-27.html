==To Do==
*Colony verification PCR of rfp-based RBS tester (done)
*Scarring PCR of E0240 with Tm of 49.5 deg (done)
*Grad. PCR of I2055 (done)
*Decide what to do with rfp promoter tester (ligation)

==Colony PCR==
*Colony 1 is from yesterday's single colony; 2-7 are from today's

==I2055 gradient PCR==
*Using another stock of primers
*Using same gradient, 49-60 deg
*Made new dilution of dNTP's

==Gel==
*row 1: ladder, grad 1-12, ladder
*row 2: ladder, col 1-7, E0240, ladder
**No bands. Will upload picture.

==RFP Promoter tester==
*Ligated B0032, J04650, tet and chlor backbones
*Transformed in MG1655
