Morning: Edit CPX insert(w/ Brian)
*move passenger peptide before his tag and trypsin so that it will be displayed last
*get rid of HindIII and SalI restriction sites and redesign insert so pp/his/tryp mini insert can be switched using SfiI embedded in linkers

==Afternoon Meeting Notes==

===Editing our insertion sequences===
'''Restriction sites'''

*Our insert design used Sfi, HindIII and SalI

*Switched the passenger order on CPX: His6, Tryp, PP-> PP, His6, Tryp

*The BioBricks assembly restriction sites are: EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, PstI
**SpeI and XbaI have matching overhangs (but when you ligate them together, the restriction site is destroyed)

*Getting a grad from Rice lab to give us eCPX instead of the PI
**try calling Jeffrey Rice

*Repeating PP sequence, does that help?  Yes, you get better affinity (put a really small glycine/alganine in between)

*New insert: EcoRI SS Sfi HindIII Peptide SalI Epitope(T7) SfiI CPX Double-stop XbaI
**T7 is a peptide displayed by T7 phage, we will use its matching antibody to basically stain show that peptide has been displayed

*What order do we want EcoRI and XbaI?  Biobricks has EcoRI first

*Reduce codon repetition (don't want to deplete tRNA pool)

*How are we going to clip OmpC?

===Other Stuff===

*SP3k3, biobrick part has same origin of replication as plasmid in Rice paper (low copy)

*GeneArc will run the sequence you send through optimization programs
**if we e-mail, she will insert restriction sites where you want
**Send protein you want sequenced (in AA), highlight areas where you want to specify exact sequence of DNA (eg the restriction sites)

*Checked Lpp-OmpA display protein biobrick part from Harvard, junk.

*In the meantime while we wait for our inserts to be ordred, work on:
**vector, RBS (-10 -35), metal promoters, team name
**Check out vector in Rice paper (pBAD33, has arabinose).  We want one with medium copy, p15A origin, arabinose inducible promoter
**email biostuff@mit.edu (if you need something)

*BioBricks has plasmids

*BioBrick has a prefix and suffix standard
