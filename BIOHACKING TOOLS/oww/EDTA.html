EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a synthetic amino acid and chelating agent for divalent metals.  Usually sold as the disodium salt (CAS 6381-92-6) (Sigma E1644).

*Molecular Weight, disodium salt dihydrate: 372.24

*pK<sub>1</sub> = 1.99
*pK<sub>2</sub> = 2.67
*pK<sub>3</sub> = 6.16
*pK<sub>4</sub> = 10.26


*Most enzymes that synthesize or modify nucleic acids (e.g. polymerases, ligases, kinases, nucleases) are Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent. The addition of EDTA is a convenient way to stop these reactions.

*EDTA is a component of many buffers used to store DNA, such as [[TE buffer]], where the EDTA removes the metal cofactors (typically Mg<sup>++</sup> required for activity of DNAses and other DNA damaging enzymes.

*EDTA is essentially insoluble in water, and will only dissolve when neutralized with sodium hydroxide to a pH = 8.0

*Standard stock solutions are 0.5M at pH 8.0.  A 1M solution cannot be made.  Autoclave.

*Making the standard solution from disodium EDTA (the typical form sold) requires approximately 1 molar equivalent of NaOH

*[http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/edta/edtah.htm Here's] a great page about EDTA, including [http://www.cem.msu.edu/~cem333/EDTATable.html formation constant] (K<sub>f</sub>) values for metal-EDTA complexes. Note that many heavy metal ions (like Fe<sup>3+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup>, and Zn<sup>2+</sup>) are chelated much more strongly than Mg<sup>2+</sup>. A little bit of EDTA in your reaction will go a long way to keep these evildoers out of trouble and away from your precious biomolecules without interfering with your Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent reactions.
