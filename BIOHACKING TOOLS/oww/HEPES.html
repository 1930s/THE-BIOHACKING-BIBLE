N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-Nâ€™-(2-ethanesulfonic acid); 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid; CAS NUMBER: 7365-45-9

A Good buffer <cite>Good66</cite><cite>Good74</cite><cite>Blanchard84</cite>.  Stable pH vs. temperature, no primary amine groups, no metal chelation, near physiologic pH range.

* pK<sub>a</sub> at 25C of 7.55 (7.31 at 37C)
* a second pK<sub>a</sub> at pH 3 is not of interest
* usable buffering range of 6.8  to 8.2
* molecular weight 238.3
* &Delta;pK<sub>a</sub>/&Delta;T = -.014
*HEPES contains tertiary amines, which are reactive under certain conditions. See its structure in the [http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/search/ProductDetail/SIGMA/H3375 Sigma catalog].
*Chemical formula: C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>S

Buffers are typically 1 M, prepared by neutralizing HEPES with sodium hydroxide.   HEPES is essentially insoluble until it is neutralized.
