==Protocols for CBD and Biofilm applications==
*Construct all DNA assemblies.

*Test out construction of vesicles using mineral oil method.

*In vivo and in vitro testing of simple DNA constructs with the promoters pLux, pTet, pT7 and pcI; followed by a reporter GFP
**3 repeats to be done for each test
**Positive control: Purified GFP in E.coli, and then in the cell extract
**Negative control: Cell extract without any DNA insert or GFP
*Fluorescence is measured for every 15 min until the levels of GFP reaches a steady state 
*The best promoter sequence is determined and implicated into the two applications.
**Definition of best promoter: 
***Fastest expression of GFP 
***Highest detection of fluorescence

*When Dsred Express gene sequence arrives, clone and express it (Temperature: 25°C
*Draw up a calibration curve of DSred Express.
*Positive control: Dsred Express in cell extract
*Negative control: Cell extract only


===Problems===
*The commercial cell extracts come in 50µl, while the wells in the fluorometer plates can hold up to 200µl.
*Water evaporates when fluorescent readings are taken.



==Protocol specific for CBD==
*Test for temperature range and Life span of system
*Temperature range: 4°C- 60°C. 
**Temperature Intervals: 4°C  15°C  25°C  37°C  45°C  60°C
**Readings are taken at every 15 min intervals
**3 readings are taken for each sample at a particular temperature

*Subject system to temperature changes and measure effect on fluorescence levels
*Type of gradients: Steep/ Gentle/ Pulse
*Temperature increment: from 4°C to 25°C
*Apply the temperature increment only after the GFP levels have reached steady state
