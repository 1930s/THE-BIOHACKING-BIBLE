==Results from Yesterday's Transformations==

'''osmYFull.E0840'''

Passed antibiotic resistance test- only grows on AMP/TET

'''J45800 hopefuls'''

All grew


'''osmYShort.inverter.E0840'''

Some colonies 

'''J45170.J45320'''

Very few colonies- Maybe 3

==Course of Action==

1. Colony PCR J45170.J45320s and J45800 hopefuls- DONE

2. Miniprep LCs of R0040.E0840, osmYShort.E0840, and osmYFull.inverter.E0840- DONE

3. LC J45170.J45320, J45800, osmYShort.inverter.E0840, osmYFFull.E0840- DONE

4. Make plates- DONE

5. Check sequencing (results will not be available until later tonight)

6. Respond to Jason in the GC lab- DONE (MEETING AT 2 PM ON MONDAY TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE MACHINE)

7. Smell IK cells- SMELL GREAT TO ME- DONE

8. Update google doc- DONE

9. Make a list of needed submissions and resubmissions to the Registry- DONE

==List of Needed Submissions to the Registry==

'''J45120'''

Cells in the Registry have a mix of plasmids.  We isolated a colony with just J45120 and have a glycerol available.

'''J45180'''

The J45180 in the Registry is merely osmY + inverter - R0040.  We have another glycerol containing the correct J45180, osmYQ119B.

'''J45700 & J45900 (Constitutive Banana)'''

The J45700 in the Registry is merely J45320.  After an antibiotic test and an analysis using the GC, we can submit these parts.

'''J45600 & J45800'''

We are in the process of building/verifying.

'''J45995, J45996, J45997, & J45998'''

Cells glyceroled and verified via sequencing and antibiotic test

'''J45999'''

We have a glycerol of these in our fridge.  The entry in the Registry most likely contains a plasmid since it is chloramphenicol AND ampicillin resistant.
