*Got new T9002_E0240_R primer in -  diluted to 40 uM
*Set up a 100ul supermix PCR rxn of E0240 for T9002 to put on tails
**Ran at 52
*Ran a gel which looks great
*PCR cleaned
*Digesting w/ Spe/Nsi in buffer 2 overnight



==Other==
*Made a new overnight from the registry plate of 1AK3
*Got sequencing back for I2055-3K3 - really wierd
**1st half of part (till middle of GFP) was put in backwards, rest of part was forwards
*Found that I2055 has an Mfe1 site in the middle of GFP and that's where the problem happened
*Changed synthesis proposal so doesn't have the Mfe1 site in GFP - silent mutation
