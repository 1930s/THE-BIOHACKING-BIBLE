==AFM Lab Start Guide==
''Please read this before starting AFM lab.''

===Sample handling===
*Bring the sample stage ALL THE WAY DOWN when changing samples. (You must practice sample change on the "training AFM" before doing it on your AFM)
*Always keep samples in a covered case when not in use.
*Always handle them with tweezers.
*Use gloves when handling E.coli samples.

===Cantilever probe handling===
*Ask an instructor for probe change. 
*Try not to break the cantilever. Always look under stereomicroscope when bringing samples in contact with cantilever (look for itâ€™s reflection on the shiny sample surface)

===Laser alignment and focus===
*Needs to be done every time you change probe.
*It is easier to use flat sample surface to get a nice force curve.

===Device setup connections===
*Do NOT change the angle of the column (Do not touch the two screws on the back of AFM)
*Do not unplug/plug cable connections while the power supply is turned on -it will damage the power supply

===Data acquisition===
*Start the new version of matlab (MATLAB R2007b) and change its path to Z:\athena.mit.edu\course\20\20.309\Students\Labs\AFM and type in ScannerGUI in the command window.
