This week our goal was to ligate our lead parts to LuxI and GFP. (As of our transformations on Thursday, these didn't work)

Things ground to a bit of a halt this week, we ran out of competent cells on Thursday and Friday.

We received T7 parts from Barry Canton, and the Amplifier DNA from Imperial. We'll test the amplifier next week.
