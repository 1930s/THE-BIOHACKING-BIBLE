=Agenda=
*Check sequencing results of second (uncontaminated) set of miniprepped 3K3+F2620+B0034
*Digest CPX, 3K3+F2620+B0034 (if sequencing is correct), and a hi-copy plasmid for 3A assembly
*Ligate digested CPX, 3K3+F2620+B0034, and hi-copy plasmid
*Test Standard Assembly of pSB3k3 with F2620, B0034, E1010 using AHL
**LC grown overnight

==Digestion of CPX for 3A==
<pre>

==Digestion of (F2620 and B0034) for 3A==
<pre>
37 µl      (F2620 and B0034) @ 27 ng/µl
0.5 µl     BSA
5 µl       NEB2 Buffer

5.5 µl     H2O
------------------
50 µl      Total
</pre>

*Digested pSB1AC3: 15 µl @ 125 ng/µl
*Digestions placed in 37C @ 11am

===Changes to the OWW "Transforming Chemically Competent Cells" Protocol for TK Cells===
*All steps are the same, except for the following:
**In step 2, Note -- TK said that less than 5% of the solution should be cell volume
**Step 4 -- change to 45 to 50 seconds at 42 degrees
**Step 7 -- The 45 incubation time is okay for Kan and Amp resistances, but should be increased to 1.5 to 2 hours for Tet or Cm resistant cells
