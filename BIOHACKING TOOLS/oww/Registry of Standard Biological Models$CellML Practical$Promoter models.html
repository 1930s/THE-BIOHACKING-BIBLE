==Constitutive Promoter Model==
*Assumptions:
**continuous expression at a fix transcription rate
**unlimited resources in transcription (polymerases + mRNA)
**No activation or repression involved

*BioBrick example:

*CellML interface

*CellML file


==Repressed Promoter Model==
*Assumptions:
**simple binding of the repressor following a Monod-type of equation
**Maximum rate of transcription
**unlimited resources in transcription (polymerases + mRNA)

*BioBrick example:

==Activated Promoter Model==
*Assumptions:
**simple binding of the activator following a Monod-type of equation
**Maximum rate of transcription
**unlimited resources in transcription (polymerases + mRNA)
