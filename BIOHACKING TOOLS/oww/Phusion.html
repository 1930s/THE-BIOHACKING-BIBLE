==Description==

Fusion of a Pyrococcus (Pfu) -like enzyme with a double-strand DNA binding domain → increased processivity.

==Statistics about Phusion™ High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase==
*10x processivity compared to Taq
*50x fidelity compared to Taq
*Creates blunt end
*Error rate is 4.4 X 10-7 in Phusion HF buffer and 9.5 X 10-7 in GC buffer
*Non-displacing

==Quick reference reaction mix==
