There are a number of web communities that share information in bioinformatics, either exclusively or not. It might be helpful to list them here and to describe them a little, in terms of quality and activity.

== Wikis with some bioinformatics contents ==

Here is a list of wikis that include bioinformatics material:
* [[wikipedia:Category:Bioinformatics|Category:Bioinformatics]] at Wikipedia, the free '''encyclopedia'''.
* you are currently reading [[Wikiomics:About | Wikiomics]] located at http://wikiomics.org, a world-writeable '''bioinformatics howto''' wiki for the whole bioinformatics community and users of bioinformatics.
* The [[OBF:Main Page | Open Bioinformatics Foundation]] coordinates '''open source bioinformatics software''' such as BioPerl, Biopython and several other [[OBF:projects|projects]].
* [http://apps.bioneq.qc.ca/twiki/bin/view/Knowledgebase The Bioinformatics Knowledge Base] features very accessible articles about '''fundamental aspects of bioinformatics'''.
* the [http://wiki.nodalpoint.org/ Nodalpoint wiki] is pretty recent too.  http://nodalpoint.org is primarily an open blog (see the blog section).
* [http://openwetware.org OpenWetWare] - Wiki started as a website for sharing methods and protocols in experimental biology, recently grown to the point of being main gateway of promoting sharing of information, know-how, and wisdom among researchers. It has the particularity of providing space for '''lab pages''', whether they are wet labs or not. See [http://openwetware.org/wiki/Getting_Started_on_OpenWetWare their guidelines for getting started] and their [http://openwetware.org/wiki/Etiquette Ã©tiquette]. Requires an approved subscription, so it is a good place to maintain your own lab pages.
* [http://karma.med.harvard.edu/ FreeBio] is a wiki maintained by Alexander (Sasha) Wait. His interests include synthetic biology, digital evolution, quantum information processing and sustainable Internet communities.
* [http://webclu.bio.wzw.tum.de/w/ BioInfo wiki], an open knowledge library for bioinformatics-related content. This site is supposed to contain word definitions, articles and collected material about Bioinformatics.
* [http://seek.ecoinformatics.org/ The Science Environment for Ecological Knowledge (SEEK)] is a five year initiative designed to create cyberinfrastructure for ecological, environmental, and biodiversity research and to educate the ecological community about '''ecoinformatics'''.
* [http://biowiki.org BioWiki] is used as an online lab notebook for research and teaching at the Holmes Lab in computational bioengineering and evolutionary genomics at UC Berkeley. 
* [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Computational_Biology Computational biology Wikibook] is an open-content '''textbook''', hosted at [http://en.wikibooks.org WikiBooks].
* [http://www.biological-cybernetics.de/wiki BioCybernetics wiki], covers mathematical description of biological information processing structures ([http://www.biological-cybernetics.de/wiki/index.php/WikiNode -> WikiNode])
* General-purpose bioinformatics libraries for different programming languages: [http://bioperl.open-bio.org BioPerl], [http://biojava.org/wiki/Main_Page BioJava], [http://biopython.org/wiki/Main_Page BioPython], [http://wiki.bioruby.org/ BioRuby].
* [http://amateurbioinformatics.pbwiki.com Amateur Bioinformatics Wiki] is for the '''general public'''. It aims at making bioinformatics accessible to the layperson who has a taste for science.

Please also have a look at the [http://biowiki.org/BioWikis compilation of biology wikis] at [http://biowiki.org BioWiki].

For a discussion about the use of wikis in science, and the practical issues that are related, check [http://collaboration.wikicities.com/wiki/Science_and_wikis this page] at [http://metacollab.net Metacollab]. This [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7068/full/438548a.html ''Nature'' article] <cite>natureweb</cite> might interest you too.

== Wikis dedicated to specific organisms ==

* [http://rana.lbl.gov/drosophila/wiki AAAWiki]: Assembly, Alignment and Annotation of the different ''Drosophila'' genomes
* [http://ecoliwiki.org/colipedia EcoliWiki]: community-based pages about everything related to E. coli K-12, its phages, plasmids, and mobile genetic elements

== Forums, Mailing-lists ==

* [http://bioinformatics.org/pipermail/bio_bulletin_board/ bio_bulletin_board@bioinformatics.org]: this list is for general discussions about bioinformatics.
* [http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/forum.html pdb-l@rcsb.org]: this is the mailing-list of the Protein Data Bank. This is a very good place to ask questions about structural bioinformatics.
* [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/bioinformatics/ bioinformatics@yahoogroups.com]: the Yahoogroups mailing-list about bioinformatics in general, has about 1000 members and relatively low traffic.
* [http://listes.impg.prd.fr/wws/arc/bioinfo/ bioinfo@impg.prd.fr]: '''the''' French mailing-list for announcements about bioinformatics. With more than 3000 members, this list is moderated and normally not for public discussions. It has a low traffic and is highly recommended to anyone among the French community of bioinformaticians.
* [https://bioinformatics.org/mailman/listinfo/bioedu bioedu@bioinformatics.org]: discussions about bioinformatics '''education'''

== Blogs ==

A [http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?q=bioinformatics+OR+%22computational+biology%22 Google Blog Search] might return additional interesting results. Also, BioWiki has a current list of bio- and tech-oriented blogs - [http://biowiki.org/BlogRoll BlogRoll at Biowiki]. Feel free to comment them here:

* http://nodalpoint.org is an open bioinformatics weblog with an average of 3-4 messages a week since 2000.
* http://hublog.hubmed.org/ - author's of HubMed own blog, mainly around biology oriented computer science
* [http://www.ghastlyfop.com/blog/ Flags and Lollipops] - blog containing bioinformatics and genomics news, as in above, a lot of interesting content
* [http://blogs.nature.com/ng/freeassociation/ Free Association] - Nature Genetics blog, containing editorial comments, links and news in genetics
* [http://binf.twoday.net/ Notes from the Biomass (A Bioinformatics Blog)] - blog written by Roland Krause, bioinformatician at the Max-Planck-Institute for Infection Biology.
