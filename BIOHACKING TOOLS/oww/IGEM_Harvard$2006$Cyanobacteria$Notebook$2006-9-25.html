Cyano continues! And you all thought we were dead...

===To do===
*Chiba letter
*Miniprep Nick's plates and sequence
*Begin taking aliquots of M2-7 J04500+KaiC at time points
*The other (less than 6) stage1 ligations

===Verification of J04500+KaiC===

Based on the (20!) sequencing results from way back in August (how is it freezing now...)I:

*Created a file on MCB1001 (small room, left computer), ZS_J04500+kaiC which contains the expected plasmid we want
*Aligned all 10 VF2's to the expected file
*Tested fully one of them, M2-7

And we have the correct plasmid! First biobrick...
