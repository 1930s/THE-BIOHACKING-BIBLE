Brief description of what's out there and what we've got.

*EYFP (is what people are usually referring to when they say just YFP)
:GFP with S65G/S72A/T203Y

*Citrine (Griesbeck JBC'01)
:EYFP with V68L/Q69M

*Venus (Nagai NBT'02)
:EYFP with F46L/F64L/M153T/V163A/S175G

*Our "Venus" (aka Citrus)
:Venus with V68L/Q69M

*Silver's Venus (Surprisingly, approx 8 fold less bright than Citrus when expressed in E.coli; expression may be the problem, rather than brightness)
:Citrus with V68L / R80Q / H231L

*Citrus-LAA

*Citrus-LAA+2 (NY sequence repeated as spacer between ClpX and SspB binding sites)

*weak RBS - Citrus

*weak RBS - Citrus-LAA

*mCherry


*YPet (Nguyen NBT'05)
Venus with I47L/S208F/V224L/H231E/D234N

===What mutations do===

'''F46L''':  faster maturation at 37deg <cite> #Nagai </cite> <BR>
'''F64L''':  reduced sensitivity to pH and Cl-, folding<BR>
'''V68L''':  reduced sensitivity to pH <cite> #Miyawaki </cite> <BR>
'''Q69M''':  2x photostabilty, lower pKa (5.7), indifference to chloride, better expression at 37deg and in organelles <cite> #Griesbeck </cite> <BR>
'''T203Y''':     <br>
'''A206K''':  monomer (instead of weak dimer)
