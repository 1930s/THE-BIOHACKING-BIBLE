==Overview==

The purpose of this protocol is to provide a detailed method for the creation of an NTA surface on top of a carboxymethylated dextran chip.  This protocol specifically focuses on the BiaCore CM5 chip, but could be adapted to other similar chips.

==Materials==
*CM5 Chip (New)
*EDC (50µl)
*NHS (50µl)
*Wash Bottle with Deionized Water 
*3mg/ml NTA-NH2 (100µl)

==Definitions==
*EDC: 1-Ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl)cabodiimide HCL
*NHS: N-Hydroxysuccinimide
*NTA-NH2: (S)-N-(5-Amino-1-Carboxypentyl)iminodiacetic acid, pH adjusted to pH 8.0

==Procedure==
#To the gold side (concave) of a CM5 chip mix 50μl each EDC and NHS.
#Incubate for 20 minutes
#Wash chip with DI and then dry with house air.
#Add 100 ul of 3mg/ml NTA-NH2  to the chip
#Incubate for 30 minutes.
#Wash chip with DI and then dry with house air.
#Install into the BiaCore and perform [[NTA surface preparation | NTA Surface Preparation]].
