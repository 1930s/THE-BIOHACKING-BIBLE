# When you are done, go to main page ([[MIBLab]])
# Click on each project you're involved with (PADRE, MAGMA, etc) and add a link for your page by putting your name within double brackets (This is the same name you use to create your in step #3).
# When you click on that link, it will take you to the page you created for yourself.

==Creating Subsections==

===Subsection===
====Sub-subsection====

==New Line Demonstration==
This will demonstrate how to insert a new line. <br/> A single <nowiki><br/></nowiki> will act as the "enter" key.
Empy line starts new paragraph

==Creating Lists==
* It's easy to create a list:
** Start every line with a star.
*** More stars means deeper levels.
**** A newline in a list marks the end of a list item.

* An empty line starts a new list.

# Numbered lists are also good
## very organized
## easy to follow
### easier still

==Formatting==
===Page===
<center>Centered text.</center>
A [[horizontal dividing line]]:
this is above it
----
and this is below it.

<!-- comment here -->

===Character===
*''Emphasized text''
*'''Strong emphasis'''
*'''''Even stronger emphasis''''' 

*You can use <small>small text</small> for captions.

*You can <s>strike out deleted material</s>
and <u>underline new material</u>.

*Suppressing Wiki translation by using <nowiki> <nowiki></nowiki> </nowiki>

*Random Symbols:

&trade; &copy; &reg; &cent; &euro; &yen; 
&pound; &curren;

*Pre tags
<pre>
The pre tag ignores [[Wiki]] ''markup''.
It also doesn't     reformat text.
It still interprets special characters: &rarr;
</pre>

*Space in front of a line will prevent reformatting of text. 
 Putting a space at the beginning of each line
 stops the text   from being reformatted. It still
 interprets [[Wiki]] ''markup'' and special
 characters: &rarr;

==Links==

*Use double brackets for links. 
*For links on the same site, just put the name of the page: [[MAGMA]], [[PADRE]]
*For links to images, use <nowiki>[[Image:NameOfUploadedImage]]</nowiki>: [[Image:PADREGroup.JPG]]
