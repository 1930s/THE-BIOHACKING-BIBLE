Here's my list of things to do:

*Once I have keywords, rank the SNP's according to disease classifications and provide them a score.
*Write the integration for google/medstory
*XML parsing for OMIM? I think this is done already
*Eutils, anyone? I think people don't need this either.


The ranking will be done with Zach, and we need not OMIM keywords for it, but keywords from the pubmed API we discussed in class.

The news code will be available by the 19th of April
