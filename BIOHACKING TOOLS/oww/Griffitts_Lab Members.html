'''Joel Griffitts''' ''Principal Investigator''<br>
I graduated from Stanford University in 1999,  finished graduate school at UC San Diego in 2004 and then returned to Stanford to work on symbiotic nitrogen fixation. During that time, I developed several projects centered on symbiotic invasion and host-microbe compatibility. I have been on the [http://lifesciences.byu.edu/home/FacStaff/default.aspx?ID=268 BYU faculty] since 2006, where my lab is investigating various aspects of host-microbe communication.
