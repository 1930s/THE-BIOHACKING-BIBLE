*Transforming DB3.1 Cells:
# Thaw competent cells on ice.  Place required number of 17 × 100 mm polypropylene tubes on wet ice.
# Gently mix cells, then aliquot 100 µl competent cells into chilled polypropylene tubes.
# Refreeze any unused cells in the dry ice/ethanol bath for 5 minutes before returning them to the -80°C freezer.  Do not use liquid nitrogen.
# Add 5uL of biobrick construction plasmid DNA to cells, moving pipet through cells to mix.  Gently tap to mix.
# Incubate cells on ice for 30 minutes. 
# Heat-shock cells 45 seconds in a 42°C water bath; do not shake.
# Place on ice for 2 minutes.
# Add 0.9 ml of room temperature S.O.C. Medium (Cat. No. 15544-034).
# Shake at 225 rpm (37°C) for 1 hour. 
# Plate transformed cells @ 75uL and 150 uL on ampicillin plates
# Plate control cells @ 100uL on control and ampicillin plates (for a total of 8 plates)
# Incubate overnight at 37°C.

*Butanol Tolerance
**Plated 1.6% butanol cells.
**Added yesterday's 1.6% butanol tolerant cells to 3.2% butanol broth solution.  
**Put 3.2% solution cells in shaker at 37oC overnight
