On 14 July 2005 there are plates made for:
*SSY206 = Adh1 promoter, YFP (+ other stuff you can cut out), His3, 2u origin (based on pRS423).
*ALC = Adh1 promoter, Leu2, cen/ars (based on pRS415)
*AUC = Adh1 promoter, Ura3, cen/ars (based on pRS416)
*GLC = Gal1 promoter, Leu2, cen/ars (based on pRS415)
*GUC = Gal1 promoter, Ura3, cen/ars (based on pRS416)

Plasmids with Gal1 promoter to be used for clpP, clpX.  Arbitrary decision to use GLC for clpX, GUC for clpP.
