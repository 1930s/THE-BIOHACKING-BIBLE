The fluorescence was measured and converted into molecules of GFPmtu3b ''in vitro'' using our calibration curve. The standard deviation is also shown for each temperature, which is an average of three samples. However, for 25&deg;C one of the three samples was excluded because when compared to the other two samples it was  clearly an anomaly.]]

==Discussion==
Figure 1. shows us that the pT7-GFPmut3b synthesizes over time for all the temperatures tested. When the three temperatures are compared it is clear that 4&deg;C is the minimum temperature for expression and that 25&deg;C is the maxiumum. Interestingly 37&deg;C is not the maximum for pT7 ''in vitro'', with 25&deg;C producing almost double the molecules of GFPmut3b at 37&deg;C. 

All three temperatures appear to stop synthesis at a similar level. Although it is difficult with such limited sampling to extract the exact time the synthesis stops, we can approximate it to greater than 200 minutes.

The variation within the samples was different for each temperature. 4&deg;C and 25&deg;C show limited variation with 37&deg;C showing the greatest variation.

==Conclusion==
To conclude the following approximations can be made:<br>
'''Energy Levels'''
*Synthesis stops >200 minutes
'''Total Output'''
*'''4&deg;C''' - 1.2x10<sup>13</sup> molecules of GFPmut3b produced
*'''25&deg;C''' - 4x10<sup>13</sup> molecules of GFPmut3b produced
*'''37&deg;C''' - 8.3x10<sup>13</sup> molecules of GFPmut3b produced
'''Optimum Temperature'''
*25&deg;C was the optimum temperature that we found
