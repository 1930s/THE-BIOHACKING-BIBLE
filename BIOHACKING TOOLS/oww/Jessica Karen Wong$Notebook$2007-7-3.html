==To Do==
*Colony PCR I2056 Tet
*Replate I2056
*Order new primer for I2055
*Make overnights of other I2055 colonies for sequencing
*Run gel of I2056 and T9002

==I2055==
*Took out gradient PCR
*Checked sequencing using AlignX and Finch TV on Jason's computer
*I2055 had not ligated the R0040 to the I3401, aka the promoter was missing
*We went back to the gel image to see if any other colony pcr's look a bit bigger and may include R0040
*Made overnights of colonies 3,4, and 6 to miniprep for sequencing tomorrow
*5ml overnights were made with 5ul Amp and 5ul Kan b/c is on a 1AK3 plasmid
*Also designed primers to PCR R0040 in if none of the colonies were successfully ligated
**Only ordered a forward primer with Tail including Mfe1 and R0040
** format: 8-mer.MfeI.promoter+mix.part of gfp (Tm)
** CTTAGTAG.CAATTG.tccctatcagtgatagagattgacatccctatcagtgatagagatactgagcactactag.ATGCGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTTTTC (52.4)

==I2056==
*Saw a colony on the Tet plate
*Did a 10ul colony PCR on it, but result seemed slightly evaporated
*Redoing the colony PCR overnight
*Spun down and replated the rest of the transformants on both Tet and Chlor and are growing overnight

==Gel==
*[[Image:7-3.jpg|thumb|left|Gel from 7/3/07]]
*Ran a gel of the I2056 colony PCR and 10 ul of the T9002 100ul preparatory PCR
*Loaded gel L to R: Ladder __ T9002 I2056 Ladder
*Did a post stain with cybr gold
*Scarred T9002 looks the right size
*Redoing I2056
