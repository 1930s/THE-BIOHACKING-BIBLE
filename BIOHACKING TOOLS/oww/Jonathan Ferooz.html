My name is Jonathan Ferooz and I'm born at namur the 29th February 1980.

I am currently a PhD student in Belgium at the University of Namur (FUNDP), working under Prof. Jean-Jacques Letesson[http://www.fundp.ac.be/universite/personnes/page_view/01005561/cv.html]. 

I studying the function and the regulation of the flagellum in ''Brucella melitensis''.

While described as non-motile, Brucella spp. have all the genes except the chemotactic system, necessary to assemble a functional flagellum. We undertook to determine whether these genes are expressed and are playing a role in some step of the disease process.
In the lab, I show for the first time a new unknow flagellar structure in Brucella[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=15839898&query_hl=1&itool=pubmed_docsum].

I also contribute to the understanding of the flagellar regulation, especially in studying the transcriptional regulator FtcR and VjbR[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=16008582&query_hl=1&itool=pubmed_docsum].

I'd like to continue a post doc in a foreign country next year (Japan for example).

I obtained a Master in molecular and cellular biology at the University of Namur.
