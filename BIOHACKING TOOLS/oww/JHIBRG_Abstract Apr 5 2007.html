=== in vivo Molecular-Genetic Imaging of Cancer ===

[[image:thursday1.jpg|right|200px]]
in vivo molecular imaging using small animals is a relatively novel field with a short history, but remarkable advances have been made over the last decade.  In vivo imaging is a very powerful tool to study the biological questions in that it lets us search for the answers noninvasively and longitudinally under the physiological conditions.  Also, compared to the conventional animal studies, one can significantly reduce the total number of animals required for each experiment.  Among the enormous fields where in vivo molecular imaging can be applied, we have been focusing on the development of the early detection and diagnostic systems for cancer.  In this talk, I will introduce two of my ongoing projects: i) imaging the adoptive cell-based therapy against cervical cancer and ii) developing the multimodal reporter gene-based imaging system with general cancer specificity.
