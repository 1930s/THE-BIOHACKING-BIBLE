[http://bio.cs.washington.edu/MicroFootPrinter.html Microfootprinter] is a tool for locating conserved domains in prokaryotic genomes.  Starting form a specific species and gene, the program locates homologs in phylogenetically related genomes and isolates upstream sequences.  The sequences are then searched for shared motifs, which typically reflect DNA binding domains.
