* inducible gene expression system based on lambda Int/attP/attB
** OFF phase facing away from gene and blocked by strong terminator
** ON phase has promoter inverted 
** heat pulse used to switch from OFF to ON
* use lambda_xis^-cIts875 prophage
** transiently de-repress to induce Int
** Int causes promoter inversion between inverted P'OP phage att site and normal Delta_P Delta_PO pseudo-bacterial att site
** inverted promoter controls expression of desired gene (here galK), and tandemly cloned lambda N gene
** N acts on NutL placed downstream of promoter to antiterminate any termination signals in the att site
* entire promoter-inversion module can be put on any plasmid as 1.3 kb AvaI-ClaI fragment
* lambda Int 
** using direct orientation of att, does genomeic insertions or excisions
** using inverse orientation of att, does inversions
* inversion seen in other systems
** control of flagella in Salmonella
** inverting G region of Mu
** see (Simon and Hersxowitz - 1985)

== Details ==
* att site (POP')
** 492 bp HindIII-BamHI fragment of lambda (Weisberg, Landy - 1983)
** placed in inverted P'OP orientation 
* att Delta_PODelta_P'
** 116bp truncated version of lambda attP that only has elements functionally in common with bacterial attBOB'
** serves as role of attB site
* '''since inverted attP, action of Int is inversion rather than excision'''
** see (Mizuuchi - 1980, Pollock and Nash - 1983, Reyes - 1979)
* Xis inactivated so doesn't catalyze excision of the inverted product (which is substrate for Int+Xis excision)
* terminators in P'OP region are overcome when N is expressed
* Fig 2 - looks like fully induced in about 2 hours after 10 min exposure to 42 C
** almost no basal expression when not induced

== Other ways to do this ==
* '''orient attP and attB directly with a terminator in between and use Int to excise this region'''
** see (Backman - 1984)
