The ideals which have always shone before me and filled me with the joy of living are goodness, beauty, and truth. To make a goal of comfort or happiness has never appealed to me; a system of ethics built on this basis would be sufficient only for a herd of cattle.
:Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955)


It is a good morning exercise for a research scientist to discard a pet hypothesis every day before breakfast. It keeps him young.
:Konrad Lorenz (1903 - 1989)


Copy from one, it's plagiarism; copy from two, it's research.
:Wilson Mizner (1876 - 1933)


Men regard it as their right to return evil for evil - and if they cannot, feel they have lost their liberty.
:Aristotle (384BC - 322BC)
