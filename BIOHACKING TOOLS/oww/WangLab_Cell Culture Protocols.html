=== Notes About Avoiding Contamination ===
All the cell culture should be performed in the cell culture hood. And please pay special attention to '''avoid contamination'''. Here are a few examples to follow.
# Clean up the cell culture hood using ethanol before and after experiment.
# If you are moving any bottles from outside into the cell culture hood, please be sure to wipe it up with ethanol first.
# Discard the pipet tip if it touches anything unsterilized in the hood, to avoid baterial growth in the cells.
# Only use clean pipet tip to get cell culture medium; keep it away from cell culture dish to avoid passing cells in to the medium stock.
# If you switch cell type, please be sure to switch to a new vacuum tip to avoid cross contamination of different cell types.
