==Overview==

Protocol for making collagen-GAG meshes (150 ML SAMPLES).

==Materials==
===Reagents===
*250 mL of 0.05M acetic acid
*0.75 g of collagen (Type I, Insoluble from Bovine Achilles Tendon) 
*0.0795 g chondroitin-6-sulfate

===Equipment===
*Homogenizer
*250 ml jacketed beaker
*Cold water bath
*Ultrasonicator
*Magnetic stir plate 
*Lyophilizer
*Vacuum oven
*Metal mold

==Procedure==
===Making 0.05 M solution of acetic acid===
Note: This solution has a shelf life of one week.
#Fill sterilized bottle with 250 mL of Millipore water.
#Add 715 ÂµL acetic acid.

===0.5% w/v Dispersion of Collagen in Acetic Acid===
Note:  Keep collagen mixture at below 20&deg;C.
#Add 0.75 g of collagen (Type I, Insoluble from Bovine Achilles Tendon) to a 250 ml jacketed beaker beaker.  (0.5 % w/v, this type of collagen should be stronger than from calf skin)
#Add 150 ml of 0.05 M acetic acid to the beaker. 
#Mix solution with homogenizer at full speed for approximately 5 minutes, or until no large fibrils or chunks are apparent.  Make sure that tip has been washed thoroughly (ethanol, rinse with Millipore water)  
#Connect the beaker inlet and outlet to the bath (Fisher Scientific), and set bath temperature at 4&deg;C. Turn on bath and allow the bath to reach at least 10&deg;C.  Make sure bath is filled to second line.  Add a few drops of Algicide each time the bath is used. 
#Set the sonicater controller to the ID03 program.  (Amplitude 100% (dial), 59 min, 5 sec on, 10 sec off). Press RECALL. Type in 03 and press ENTER.  
#Place sonicater horn in collar, making sure tip of sonicater does not touch the bottom of the beaker.  Press START/STOP on sonicater controller.
===Addition of the 0.53 % w/v Solution of Chondroitin 6-Sulfate (C6S) in Acetic Acid===
#Measure 0.0795 g C6S into a 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tube.  
#Add 15 ml 0.05 M acetic acid to the tube.  This should be 10% of the volume of the collagen mixture.  
#Mix the C6S solution by shaking with cap on.
#Transfer collagen solution to a sterilized non-jacketed beaker.  Add clean stir bar and place on stir plate at setting 5. 
#Add C6S solution dropwise to stirring collagen solution. Roughly 1 ml/min addition. 
#Remove stir bar and transfer collagen-GAG solution back to jacketed beaker.
#Continue sonicating at the same settings for 90 more minutes to ensure an even dispersion.  
#Degas mixture in a vacuum flask for 30 minutes until bubbles are no longer present. 

===Setting the Scaffold (for any initial volume)===
#Pour 4 mL collagen-C6S mixture into each well in a 25-well metal mold.
#Freeze at -20&deg;C for 15 minutes, and then transfer to -80&deg;C for one day.
#Transfer to sterilized lyophilizer for 2 days.
#Heat in vacuum oven at 105&deg;C, at a vacuum reading of ~22 inHg, for 2 days in order for the meshes to be sturdier.
#Keep meshes on dessicant to keep dry.

==Notes==
*The mixture may be stored in a capped bottle at 4&deg;C for about 4 months.  
*Re-blend at 4&deg;C at an amplitude of 60 with the pulser set to 5 sec for 15 minutes to use.
