==Function==
The purpose of the actuator is to convert PoPS -> Cool

==Description==
Takes in PoPS from signal processor and converts into Action.  If no signal processor, take in PoPs from Recievers

==Goals==
**Collect the known reporters from both FecA and ToxR studies
**Make sure reporter parts that are part of plasmids get here
**Biobrick these parts
**Test parts by using constitutive promoter

==Current Status==
*Some parts specified 
**GFP under ctx promoter [http://rosalind.csail.mit.edu/r/parts/partsdb/view.cgi?part_id=5784 BBa_J07011]
**GFP under FecA promoter [http://rosalind.csail.mit.edu/r/parts/partsdb/view.cgi?part_id=5796 BBa_J07020]
*Parts done:
**GFP with RBS (Strong) [http://rosalind.csail.mit.edu/d/parts/partsdb/view.cgi?part_id=5338 BBa_E0840]

*[[../Actuators under consideration/]]

==Experiments==
*put GFP under constitutive reporter --> test biobrick for future use

==Open Issues/Questions==
*What are people planning to do for experiments to test for the overall signalling of the system?
*Actuator compatable with analog/digital signal
*LVA degradation time
*What is cool?
**TK has all sorts of luciferase
**DE knows somebody in MN who has all sort of pigment genes cloned
**motility?
