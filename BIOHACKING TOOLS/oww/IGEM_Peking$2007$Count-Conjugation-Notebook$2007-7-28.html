==oriT Knock Out==
*By Xu Anting
:The transformation of ligation products finished, with incubating the resulting DH5a in LB Amp X-gal, 37 centigrade. Hoping to get results tomorrow.

=Lock & Key By Yu Tao and Zheng Qinsi=
==Mini-prep: R0010, J23066 and B0015==
*Using Transgen mini plasmid purification kit.
*50uL per tube after purification, 2 tubes per type of plasmids.
===Mini-prep single digesting test result===
*Digesting all the plasmids with EcoRI. 
*Each digestion system contains：

<pre>
1 µl       10*H buffer
0.25 µl    EcoRI
3 µl       Plasmid
6 µl       ddH20
--------------------------
10 µl      Total
</pre>
*37℃ culutre for 3 hours.
*from ''left'' to ''right'':

===Mini-prep double digesting test result===
*Samples stored at -20℃ last night.
*from ''left'' to ''right'':
#R0010<-J23066-1 @ EcoRI
#R0010<-J23066-1 @ XbaI/PstI
#R0010<-J23066-2 @ EcoRI
#R0010<-J23066-2 @ XbaI/PstI
#R0010<-J23066-3 @ EcoRI
#R0010<-J23066-3 @ XbaI/PstI
#R0010 @ PstI/SpeI
#J23066 @ PstI/XbaI

*Still there are some unknown bands shown up in R0010 and B0015 plasmids. I suggest a re-mini-prep again.

==B0015, E0040(pSB3K3) and R0040 Double Digestion Product Purification==
*The digestion was under way yesterday.
*use Transgen EasyPure PCR Purification Kit for E0040(pSB3K3) and Quick Gel Extraction Kit for B0015.
*30uL per tube after purflication, one tube, respectively.

==Ligation: E0040(pSB3K3)<-B0015==
*Ligate the B0015 fragment and E0040(pS3K3) vector
*Ligation system contains:

<pre>
7 µl       B0015 fragment
1 µl       E0040(pSB3K3) vector
1 µl       T4-Ligase
1 µl       10 X ligation buffer
0 µl       ddH20
--------------------------
10 µl      Total
</pre>

*The negative control group contains no fragment but 7uL ddH2O instead.
*4℃  overnight.

===Transformation Result: J23078(pEASY-T2)===
*There are colonies both in the experimental plate and the negative control plate.
*Both plates are of no differences in the number of colonies.
*Number of colonies: 5 in the experimental plate and 2 in the negative control plate.
*Select 2 probable positive colonies from the experimental plate, culture them in liquid LB overnight for mini-prep.

===Mini-prep Preparation: R0010 and B0015===
*Culture R0010 and B0015 positive colonies in liquid LB overnight for mini-prep.
