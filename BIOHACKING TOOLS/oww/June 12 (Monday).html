===Folding DNA Nanostructures===
1. Working Stocks
    44 nM scaffold (20 microL)
    0.99 microM of each oligo
2. Protocol
    - goal: 10 nM scaffold w/ 100 nM each oligo, total rxn vol of 20 microL
    - calculations:
       scaffold = (10 nM)/(44 nM) * 20 microL = 4.5 microL
       oligos = (100 nM)/(990 nM) * 20 microL = 2 microL
    - reaction mixture:
       4.5 microL p7308 scaffold
       2 microL oligos
       2 microL 10x folding buffer (500 mM HEPES ph 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 100 mM MgCl2)
       11.5 microL dH2O
    - annealing times:
       90 dC, 5'
       65 dC, 20'
       55 dC, 20'
       45 dC, 20'
       37 dC, 30'
    - neg. controls: 1 replacing oligos w/ water, 1 replacing scaffold w/ water


===Transformation===
1. Plasmids
    R0010: lac operon promoter
    E7104: T7 promoter + GFP
    E0241: GFP
2. Protocol
    - let chemically competent OneShot Top10 cells thaw on ice
    - added appropriate DNA to cells and tapped gently to mix
    - let sit on ice for 20 min
    - heat shocked @ 42 dC for 30"
    - let cool on ice for 2 min
    - added 200 microL SOC media
    - shook @ 37 dC for 1 hr
    - pipetted and spread onto agar plates treated w/ ?
    - incubated @ 37 dC overnight agar side-up
