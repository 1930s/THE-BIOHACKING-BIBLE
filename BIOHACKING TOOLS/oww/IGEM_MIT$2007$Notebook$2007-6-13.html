=LAB WORK=
*Purify digests on gel (EGFP and NNX)
*Ligation overnight

*Pour LB/Amp plates

==Purifying the DNA==
#Denature the enzymes by exposing the samples to high heat in the Master Gradient Cycler.
##Put the samples in, close lid
##Put 65°C for 15 minutes
##Put heat on and press enter
## Remember to turn off the heat when done!
#Prepare the gel
##Create a gel as usual (50 ml of Agar stuff, 5 µl of SYBR Safe DNA Stain)
## Put these ingredients together
##*25 µl of digest
##*6 µl of LB

*L (Ladder)
**1kb Ladder   2µl
**Loading Buffer 6 µl
**H20     22 µl
**Total: 30 µl because 1kb ladder is 500 ng/µl
*U (Undigested)
**5 µl DNA
**6.25 µl Loading Buffer
**19 µl H20
**Total: 30.25

*Gel run at 85 volts for 45 min


===Protocol for Purifying DNA from Agarose Gel===
#Remove DNA fragment from agarose gel with razor blade
#Weigh slice in colorless tube, add 3 volumes Buffer QG or QX1 to 1 volume of gel (100mg ~ 100µl)
#Dissolve gel by incubate at 55°C temp block. vortex every 3 minutes until dissolved
#Make sure solution is yellow, if not consult Qiagen guidebook
#To bind DNA apply sample to a spin column and centrifuge for 1 min
#(Optional) Discard flow through and add .5ml Buffer QG and centrifuge for 1 min.
#To wash, add .75ml of PE Buffer and centrifuge for 1 min
#Centrifuge again to spin off excess
#Place column in clean centrifuge tube
#To elute, add 50 µl H20 and centrifuge for 1 min

==Ligation==
*Best ratio is between 3:1 to 5:1 of insert to backbone
*Use this equation
**<math>M_{I} = Moleratio_{\frac{I}{v}} * \frac{bp_{I}}{bp_{v}} * M_{vector}</math>
**Usually want <math>M_{v}</math> to be between 20 ng and 100 ng 
**Once we solve for <math>M_{i}</math> we should multiply it by between 3-5 to get the appropriate ratio
*Actual Calculation for a 4:1 ratio
**We decide <math>m_{v}</math> = 40 ng and rearrange the equation.
**<math>\frac{4695}{720}=\frac{m_{v}}{m_{I}}*4</math>
**<math>m_{I} = 24.61 ng</math>

**16°C for 5 hours
**60°C for 10 minutes to heat kill the enzymes

==Making LB Amp Agar Plates==
#Obtain LB from stock room in far side of 5th floor
#Microwave at 50% power for 10 minutes
#Remove from microwave; it should be boiling and smell like wet dog
#Place in 55°C water bath for 5-10 minutes
#Wait until it is cool to the touch
#Add 500 µl of Amp
#Swirl Gently
#*Avoid bubbles
#*Can quickly flame to remove them
#Mark the Plates with a Marker or Tape
#Pour and fill to 75% each plate
##Lift up lid
##Pour to cover ~90%
##Gently lift up plate and remove from stack
##If has bubbles, set aside for removal of bubbles
#Remove the bubbles
##Can only be done on liquid state ones
##Take a Bunsen burner and quickly flame
#Let Cool
#If excess LB remains, let harden then remove and throw away
#*Don't pour it down the sink!
