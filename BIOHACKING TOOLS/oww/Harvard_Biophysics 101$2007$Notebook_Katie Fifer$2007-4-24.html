* we're going to pull the genbank file down in its entirety and parse for relavant features using the code i wrote last time. (we gave up the battle to get just a piece of the genbank file for now... someday hopefully someone will come up with a better way of doing this but we're just trying to move forward for now.....)
* NCBI gene, for each gene that we get back, has files about each gene containing literature sources and info about exons/introns etc... I'm going to work on parsing this for tomorrow and thursday.
