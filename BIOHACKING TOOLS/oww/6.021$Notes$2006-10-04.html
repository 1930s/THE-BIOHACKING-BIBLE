==Ion Transport==
* Major constituents of cells
* important functions
* charge is substrate for neural communication
* every charged particle (in principle) affects every other ion
** more complicated than other mechanisms

==Mechanisms==

2 distinct mechanisms of diffusion and drift

===Diffusion===
Given by Fick's law
<math>\phi_n = -D_n\frac{\partial c_n}{\partial x}</math>

===Drift===
* Effect of electrical forces on montion of charged particles.
* Electric Field (vector field) <math>E(x,t)</math>
* force on particle <math>f_p = QE(x,t) = z_neE(x,t)</math> where <math>z_n</math> is valence and <math>e\approx 1.6\cdot 10^{-19}</math> C.
* Motions of small particles in water are viscosity dominated (Stokes 1855)

<math>v\propto f_p = u_p f_p = u_n f</math> where <math>u_p</math> is mechanical mobility in units of velocity/force, <math>u_n</math> is the molar mechanical mobility and <math>f</math> becomes the force on a mole of particle.

For charged particles:
<math>v=u_nz_neN_AE(x,t)=u_nz_nFE(x,t)</math> (<math>F=eN_A</math> which is Faradya's number) = charge/mole about 96500 C/mol.

<math>D_n=u_nRT</math>: Einstein's relation

Flux due to drift:
<math>\phi_n = \lim_{A\rightarrow 0 ; \Delta t\rightarrow 0}\frac{c_n(x,t)A\Delta x}{A\Delta t} = vc_n(x,t)</math>

<math>\phi_n = c_n(x,t)u_nz_nFE(x,t) = -c_nu_nz_nF\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}</math> where <math>E=-\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}</math> (electric field depends on the potential gradient)

The flux of ions is the current density given by <math>J_n = z_nF\phi_n</math> This is in units of current/area and is easier to measure than flux.

===Combined transport===
Combining diffusion and drift to get '''Nernst-Planck Equation''':

<math>J_n = -z_nFD_n\frac{\partial c_n}{\partial x}-u_nz_n^2F^2c_n\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}</math>

Note that this is really just a combination of Fick's and Ohm's Laws.

'''Continuity:''' (needed to solve equations just like in other transport mechanisms)

<math>\frac{\partial\phi_n}{\partial x} = -\frac{\partial c_n}{\partial t}</math> or equivalently

<math>\frac{\partial J_n}{\partial x} = -z_nF\frac{\partial c_n}{\partial t}</math>

Unlike diffusion, also need one more equation for <math>\psi</math> but this electric potential depends on all particles.

From Gauss' law:
<math>\frac{\partial E}{\partial x} = \frac{1}{\epsilon}\rho(x,t) = \frac{1}{\epsilon}\sum_n z_nFc_n(x,t)</math> where <math>\epsilon</math> is the permitivity and <math>\rho</math> is the charge density.

This leads to '''Poisson's Equation'''
<math>\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2} = -\frac{1}{\epsilon}\sum_n z_nFc_n(x,t)</math>

==Electroneutrality==

*In a solution with some charge, after some time, all charges go to the edges away from each other.
* <math>\tau_r</math> is the relaxation time and is on the order of nanoseconds for physiological salines
*Similarly, in space, a region around the charge is formed that negates the charge. This is known as the Debye layer and has a thickness of around a nanometer.
*Thus for times much greater than the relaxation time and distances much greater than the Debye distance, we can assume electroneutrality of the solution.
