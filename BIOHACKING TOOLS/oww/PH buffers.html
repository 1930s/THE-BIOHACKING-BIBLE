==Method==
<br/>
#Chemical drying and weighing
#Determination of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CaCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations
#Chemical mixing
<br/>
==Detailed protocol==
<br/>
'''1. Chemical drying and weighing'''<br/>
*NaCl, KCl, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and tris: 120 °C for 2 h followed by cooling in a desiccator for 1 h. <br/>
*AMP: 50 °C for 2 h. <br/>
*Double the given weights of chemicals before drying since the desiccation in the oven reduces weights. <br/>
<br/>
'''2. Determination of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CaCl<sub>2</sub> weights <br/>
Solutions of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CaCl<sub>2</sub> must be analyzed by titrating with a calibrated silver nitrate solution<br/>
(see [[Mohr’s method]])<br/>
<br/>
'''3. Chemical mixing'''<br/>
*Add Chemicals in 600 ml beakers with magnetic stir bars on a precision balance.
*Add NaCl, KCl, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, tris (or AMP), MgCl<sub>2</sub>, CaCl<sub>2</sub> and HCl with 200 ml volumetric pipet.
*Add distilled water to bring final weight to 522.045 g for tris and 520.965 g for AMP.
*Mix with a magnetic stir bar 
*Divide the buffer solutions into plastic flasks and stored them in a cool dark place.
