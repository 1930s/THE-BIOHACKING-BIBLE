==Specifications==

{| border="1" cellpadding="5"
!<u>Bio Reporter</u> || <u>Signal Transducer</u> 
|-
|Expressed by E.coli
|Detect Bio reporter
|-
|Degradation in medium afterwards. Time needed for degradation should be equal to/less than that of GFP
|Specific response to bio reporter only
|-
|No other interaction with E.coli processes
|Real-time readout
|-
|Sufficient expression and secretion of bio reporter in medium for detection by signal transducer
|Sufficient sensitivity to detect changes in bio reporter
|-
|
|Commercially available

|}




==Possible Implementation==

#Signal transduction could involve (protein) redox-reactions
#Antigen/Antibody sensors?
#Protein sensors
#Hormone/Neurotransmitter sensors (e.g. serotonin)



:'''<u>Scenario 1:</u>'''

*E.coli is in a liquid medium
*Some bioprocess triggers production of a bio reporter (protein) in E.coli
*The bio reporter is expelled from the cell into the medium
*A sensor will measure the level of bio reporter (protein) in the medium


:'''<u>Scenario 2:</u>'''

*E.coli is in a liquid medium
*Some bioprocess triggers productio of a bioreporter (protein) in E.coli
*The bio reporter is expelled from the cell into the medium
*There, the bio reporter (protein/enzyme) breaks down a certain chemical present in the medium
*A commercially available sensor then measures the
::a) increase in concentration of the breakdown products or,
::b) the decrease in concentratio of the initial chemical
