==Problems with current methodology==
The data we got from our experiments didn't seem to fit in with what we expected from our models and prior knowledge. We have come up with a few considerations for our experimental design that might give us better results from our experiments
===Problems===
#Evaporation - is a major problem as:
#*changes the flourescence of the samples
#*changes the context
#Mixing of the samples - was not done regularly or constantly (i.e. was done manually), which:
#*affects reactions - disruptions the reaction mixture
#*affects the fluorescence
#Temperature regualtion - the temperature of the sample kept varying due to the sampling:
#*about 5mins to get one reading - sampling time of 10mins means sample not in a steady temperature - therefore need a bigger sampling time or reduce time to get readings
===Solutions===
#Mineral oil - to reduce evaporation of samples. Need to test as:
#*Might affect the reading of the fluorometer, can probably be calibrated?
#*May block the oxygen needed by the reaction mixture
#*Need to get optimum volume of mineral oil which minimises evaporation whhile not blocking all oxygen and allowing fluoromemter readings
#Double the volume of sample - would mean that less of the sample is evaporated in proportion to the total volume, but:
#*doesn't minimise the evaporation
#PCR - put the samples in PCR tubes - the heated lid would prevent condensation, but:
#*would need to keep pipetting the samples from the PCR machine to the fluorometer and back for the readings - big problem for 24hr experiments
#Humidity - increase the humidity around the samples to reduce evaporation
#*Fill the wells surrounding the wells, with the samples, with water
===Tests===
#Test for difference in fluorescence and the volume of samples wrt mineral oil being added
#*GFP vs GFP + mineral oil/Paraffin oil
#*[[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Projects/Experimental Design/Improve Methodology/Protocol1|Protocol]]
#*[[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Projects/Experimental Design/Improve Methodology/Results1|Results]]  
#Test for rate of evaporation wrt volume of mineral oil being used
#*H<sub>2</sub>O vs H<sub>2</sub>O + mineral oil (different volumes)
#*[[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Projects/Experimental Design/Improve Methodology/Protocol2|Protocol]]
#*[[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Projects/Experimental Design/Improve Methodology/Results2| Results]]
#Test for chromophore formation - ie test if oxygen still reaching the sample
#*Cell extract + DNA vs cell extract + DNA + Mineral oil
#*[[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Projects/Experimental Design/Improve Methodology/Protocol3|Protocol]]
#*[[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Projects/Experimental Design/Improve Methodology/Results3|Results]]

===More problems===
#Evaporation still occured in the samples with 30&micro;l paraffin oil, over a 21hour period (Test 3 above)
#'''Possible reasons:'''
#*Oil volume not enough to cover all of the surface of the samples
#*Shaking might have disrupted the oil - causing it to form big droplets, leaving sample uncovered
#**but no shaking was done overnight, so the oil layer should have been able to form again
#*Paraffin oil is denser than cell extract mixture so it forms a layer at the bottom 
#**Did a test today which proves paraffin (and mineral) oil less denser than cell extract
#*Some contents of the cell extract could have dissolved in the oil

===Way forward===
#Try the humidity method (described above):
#*Test whether having water samples surrounding the actual samples decreases the evaporation or not
#Create a calibration curve for evaporation over time:
#*experiment to find out how the volume change over time - use the change in mass instead of pipetting each time to get volume
