===Welcome to the Nanotherapeutics Research Laboratory at Rice University!===

Our ultimate purpose is to harness the tools of synthetic chemistry and recombinant DNA 
technology to engineer bio-inspired nanodevices for the detection and treatment of 
human diseases.

Our research is highly multi-disciplinary, relying on the efforts of scientists, engineers, 
and clinicians with diverse backgrounds and expertise. We seek to drive innovation by 
working at the interface of multiple fields, including Biophysics, Cell Biology, 
Regenerative Medicine, Drug/Gene Delivery, and Biomedical Imaging.
