The lab was pretty fun and very easy.  It taught me some useful theory, but no real useful lab skills.  The most interesting part was finding out the unknown element.  We compared what we saw with examples of several elements we found online.  This just fun to do, it was the only real exploration in the lab.  Making the lab more difficult, maybe doing more complicated elements just to take the data, might be a good idea.

Also, these summaries are supposed to report your final result + uncertainty (in this case, the Rydberg constant for Hydrogen and Deuterium that you calculated).
