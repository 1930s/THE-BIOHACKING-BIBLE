PI: Marc Dionne

Post-doc: Rebecca Clark. Rebecca is continuing the genetic screen for fly mutants with aberrant responses to mycobacterial infection. She is also working on the function of little wing, a novel conserved gene required for killing of a wide variety of bacterial pathogens.

PhD student: Martina Yildirim. Martina is examining the interaction of mycobacteria with phagocytes and looking at mechanisms of pathogenesis induced by proinflammatory signalling.
