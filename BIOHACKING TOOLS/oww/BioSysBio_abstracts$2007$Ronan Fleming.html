==Abstract==
Metabolic engineering can be accelerated using a comprehensive mass &
charge balanced stoichiometric reconstruction of the organism-specific
metabolic network. Boundary constraints, representing growth in a
defined medium, allow the characterisation of candidate metabolic
steady states of a metabolic network. Each steady state is represented
by a time invariant flux through each reaction and the concentration
of each metabolite in the network. Markov-chain, monte-carlo
algorithms are used to uniformly sample the steady state solution
space, i.e. the volume occupied by the set of feasible solutions. This
work presents the first attempt to explicitly include the conservation
of energy and the second law of thermodynamics as constraints in a
novel sampling algorithm. In E.coli the intersection of the
thermodynamically feasible solution space with the mass & charge
balanced solution space represents a minute fraction of the latter's
volume. Constraints based modelling can differentiate feasible from
infeasible states in a binary fashion. In reality, infeasible
represents the infinitely improbable, whereas not all feasible
solutions are equally probable. At equilibrium, extremal principles
are used to predict the most probable solutions within the set of
feasible. However, E.coli metabolism represents an evolved
non-equilibrium system and no clear evidence exists as to what, if
any, extremal principal applies to living systems. Here we apply
candidate extremal principals to predict the probability of non
equilibrium steady state solutions. Understanding how thermodynamic
driving forces manifest in a particular metabolic phenotype is aimed
at predicting the phenotype of genetically engineered E.coli strains.
