=== Seed Questions ===
#Is there a difference between a "modelable" genome, and a "minimal" genome?  What about a "modular" organism?
#Do we know enough about the parts of biological systems to put things back together?
#Is there a difference between "constructing" something, versus "creating" something?
#Is it easier, better, faster (etc) to understand something by tearing it apart?  Or, by putting it back together?
#<add your question here!>
