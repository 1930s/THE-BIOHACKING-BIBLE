[3.8.com] In your eyes, what is lacking/over-emphasized in the graduate curriculum?

==4. CHOICE OF A LAB IN BE==

[4.1.1] On the interview day, I was made aware of the research opportunities in BE.

[4.2.com] What research area would you like to see covered in BE that is presently lacking?

[4.3.1] One semester was enough time to choose an advisor.

[4.3.2] Meeting with at least three professors was a positive approach.

[4.3.3] I had freedom to choose an advisor.

[4.3.4] The faculty research presentations helped me choose an advisor.

[4.3.5] If the BE Retreat had been held before the advisor selection deadline, it would have aided my decision.

[4.5.2] I feel that student feedback should be factored into BE tenure decisions.

[4.5.com] Comments about the BE tenure process:

==5. UNDERGRADUATE BE MAJOR==
[5.1.1] I think that two terms of required TA service is reasonable for a graduate student in a full department.

[5.1.2] I would be willing to serve as an associate advisor for my professor's undergraduate advisees without financial incentive.

[5.1.3] A stipend for TA service beyond the requirement would be enough incentive for me to TA as many times as necessary.

[5.2.1] I am concerned about what might happen to the availability of my advisor and committee members if they take on extra undergraduate advisees and teaching requirements.

[5.3.1] I see a BE undergrad program as a great opportunity for my own education.

[5.3.2] I would be interested in hearing about the development and content of new BE undergraduate courses and how they fit into the overall curriculum.

[5.3.3] I think it would be a valuable educational experience for graduate students to play a more active role in developing the undergraduate curriculum.

[5.3.com] If so, what suggestions do you have for such interactions?

[5.4.1] BE has enough faculty to become a full department.

[5.4.2] BE has enough facilities (space) to become a full department.

==6. SOCIAL INTERACTIONS IN BE==
[6.1.1] There is enough social interaction between students in the Bioengineering and ABS tracks.

On a social level, I enjoy interacting with

[6.2.1] Lab mates 

[6.2.2] BE community 

[6.2.3] Other groups at MIT 

[6.2.4] Other groups outside of MIT 

[6.3.1] The physically non-centralized nature of the BE division hinders social interaction.

[6.4.1] I like attending BE events. 

[6.4.2] I enjoyed BE 526 after the BE seminar (weekly) 

[6.4.3] I enjoyed the BE TGIFs (monthly) 

[6.4.4] I enjoyed the BE Holiday Party (December) 

[6.4.5] I enjoyed the BE/ChemE BBQ (August) 

[6.4.6] I enjoyed the social activities during the BE Retreat (March) 

[6.4.7] I think we should join efforts more often with other MIT departments for social events.

[6.5.1] I prefer the BE.526 social hour at the Muddy Charles Pub to the “cookie hours” that used to be held prior to the BE Thursday Seminars.

[6.6.1] I enjoy participating in BE IM sports. 

[6.6.2] I prefer to participate in non-BE sports teams.

[6.7.com] What BE social events would you like to see more often organized?

[6.7.1] I feel an online BE student directory of each class with photos and contact details would be useful.

I would be willing to include the following information for such a directory:

[6.7.2] Photo (1=yes,2=no) 

[6.7.3] Contact phone number (1=yes,2=no)

[6.7.4] Address (1=yes,2=no)

==7. DIVERSITY IN BE==
[7.1.1] BE organizes enough diversity related events. 

[7.1.2] There should be more structured diversity related discussions and interactions.

[7.1.3] There should be more informal cultural events within BE to foster awareness of diversity in other peoples’ backgrounds (e.g. food, crafts, arts, movies…)

[7.2.1] I am aware of the BE Diversity recruiting trips. 

[7.2.2] I would be interested in going on one of these trips. (1=yes,2=no)

[7.3.1] BE should actively try and become more diverse. 

[7.3.2] I feel that BE has effectively addressed issues related to diversity.

[7.3.3] I do NOT see diversity as being an issue in BE. 

[7.4.1] I would be interested in helping to organize a diversity related event in BE and/or would like to become involved with the BE Diversity group. (1=yes,2=no)

[9.1.1] I am interested in pursuing a post-graduate career opportunities in
academia/industry/other. (1=academia,2=industry,3=other)

[9.2.1] I am well informed about post-graduate career opportunities in industry.

[9.2.2] I am well informed about post-graduate career opportunities in academia.

[9.2.3] I am well informed about post-graduate career opportunities outside of research and development.

[9.3.1] I am aware that the BE Board sponsors an Industrial Seminar Series (ISS).

[9.3.2] To date, I have attended a total of 1/2/3/more than 3 ISS seminars.
(1=1,2=2,3=3,4=more than 3)

[9.3.3] I feel that the ISS seminars are conducted too often/not often enough/just often enough. (1=too often,2=not often enough,3=just often enough)

[9.3.4] I think the diversity of topics covered in the ISS is appropriate. 

[9.4.com] What could the BE Division and/or the BE Board do to aid in career decisions?

==10. GENERAL==
[10.1.1] The BE Division is responsive to my needs.
