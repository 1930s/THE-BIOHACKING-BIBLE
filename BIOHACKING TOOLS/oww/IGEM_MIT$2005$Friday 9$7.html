===Updates===
This is a new article that seems like a relevant and interesting review of antibody engineering, describing scFvs in particular [[Image:EngineeredAbs NatBiot05.pdf]]

===General====
*There's a microscope in TK's lab in addition to Drew's
*Access to bld.68, lab and office off hours - will be done Wed. when Drew gets back
*Lab space: Got it all worked out, I'll show everyone around after the meeting. 

===Subteam Updates===
====Input-Maxine====
None
====Head Unit-Jen====
*BurningMan was awesome
*Will continue to work on scFv-test construct & testing
**Personally, would like to help with more urgent aspects of project
====ToxR-Will====
*Assemblies
:Been using 3-drug method
*ToxR is toxic in cells?

====FecA-Annie====
*Construction of FecA Pro-RFP, FecA Pro-GFP
:Verifying step

*FecA'
:Tried 3-step PCR method but last step failed
:Gel diagnosis suggests connection step fails --> advisors?
:PLAN: redo 3rd step

*Fur & FecA KO
:PCR CmR and TetR using new primers, only has CmR about right size, TetR controls indicated primer dimers
:PLAN: Proceed with Fur KO
::Redesign primers for PCR TetR

*Sequences have come in 
:scFv-Linker is correct
:

====Signal Processing-Ray====

====Actuator-Jessica====

===Planning===
*Scheduling
:-With Advisors
::meeting - change date and time
::Lab moving

:-With Team 
::meeting - date and time
::Team coordination
