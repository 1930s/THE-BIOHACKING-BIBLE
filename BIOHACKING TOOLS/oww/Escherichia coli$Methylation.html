*Type I methylation systems:
** ''E. coli'' K-12 restricts DNA which is '''not''' protected by adenine methylation at sites AA<sup>*</sup>C[N<sub>6</sub>]GTGC  or GCA<sup>*</sup>C[N<sub>6</sub>]GTT, encoded by the hsdRMS genes(EcoKI).  Deletions in these genes removes either the restriction or methylation or both of these functions.
** ''E. coli'' B derivative strains contain an hsdRMS system (EcoBI) restricting and protectiing the sequence TGA<sup>*</sup>[N<sub>8</sub>]TGCT or AGCA<sup>*</sup>[N<sub>8</sub>]TCA.
* The '''mcrA''' gene (carried on the e14 prophage)  restricts DNA which '''is''' methylated in C<sup>m</sup>CWGG or <sup>m</sup>CG sequences (methylation by the '''dcm''' gene product).
* The '''mcrBC''' genes restrict  R<sup>m</sup>C sequences. 
* The '''mrr''' gene product restricts adenine methylated sequences at CAG or GAC sites.
* E. coli methylates the adenine in GATC (and the corresponding A on the opposite strand) with the '''dam''' gene product.
* M.EcoKII methylates the first A at the palindromic site ATGCAT (as well as the corresponding A on the opposite strand), see (Kossykh VG (2004)  J. Bact 186: 2061-2067 PMID 15028690)  Note that this article has been retracted; the retraction appears to center on textual plagarism, not experimental results.  The homology to AvaIII is real.  I think I believe it. [[User:Tk|tk]] 20:28, 9 December 2005 (EST).  Rich Roberts reports: "We have tried ourselves to detect activity with this gene product and cannot detect any methyltransferase activity.  In our case we used antibodies able  to detect N6-methyladenine or N4 methylcytosine in DNA.  The ones we have are very sensitive and should have been able to detect 5 methyl groups in the whole E. coli chromosome.  Nothing was detected in an over expressing strain."
