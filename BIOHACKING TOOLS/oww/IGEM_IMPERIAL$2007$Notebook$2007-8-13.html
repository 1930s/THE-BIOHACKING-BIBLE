==Preparation of Stock Solutions==
*1x 1 litre of 2xYT medium in Duran bottle
*3x 1 litre of 2xYT medium in conical flask
**Sent to autoclave
*Solution A for preparation of vesicles

==Transformation of Biobricks==
#7 biobrick were transformed into XL1-Blue or BL21(DE3)
#Cells were grown for 1 hour and plated
#Plates were incubated at 37&deg;C overnight

==Pilot Preparation of Vesicles==

#Followed the desiccation and suspension stages of the vesicle preparation protocol
#One 100ml beaker was prepared with 125&mu;l of DOPC in 50ml of mineral oil
#The suspension was sonicated for 30mins and left overnight in a 27&deg;C incubator
