==To Do==
*PCR clean and then Digest T9002 with Nsi1
*Run gel of I2056
*Drop off sequencing

==T9002==
*Heat Shocked Mfe1 digest
* PCR cleaned, DNA concentration was only 19 ng/ul
*Continued the sequential digest
** Used all the Mfe1 digest product (30ul), 12.5 ul water, buffer 3
*Also trying a double digest of Mfe1 and Nsi1 in buffer 2
**11ul scarred DNA, 31.5 ul water
*PCR cleaned both
**Sequential Digest DNA concentration 10.9 ng/ul
**Double Digest DNA concentration 19 ng/ul

==I2056==
*Ran gel of the overnight colony PCR
*Have a faint band of the right size
*Overnighted 2 cultures
**One for glycerol and sequencing, one to miniprep for scarring
**Used 5ul Amp and 10ul Tet per 5ml culture 

==E0240==
[[Image:07.07.05-2.jpg|thumb|left|Gel from 7/5/07]]
*Did a 100ul preparatory PCR at 53.5
*Fwd primer BB_E0240_F  was 38.2nmole added 956ul water
*Rev primer BB_backbone was 38.09nmole added 952ul water
*Ran a gel of the PCR, sample to the right of [http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/productN3200.asp 2 log ladder]
**Faint band of correct size (3kb) but much brighter band that was too small (1kb)
*Didn't use a long enough elongation time
*Will retry with longer elongation time and both vent and [[phusion]] polymerases
