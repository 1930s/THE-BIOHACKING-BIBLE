=J45200/J45250 3-Hour Pulse experiment=

'''Protocol'''

Protocol for 3-hour pulse:

1. Add the following in a 2-L flask:

*275 mL LB AMP/TET

*27.5 uL grown J45120 culture

2. Add the following in a 2-L baffled flask:

*275 mL LB AMP/TET

*27.5 uL grown J45181 culture

3. Grow both cultures at 220 RPM at 37C, starting J45200 20 minutes before J45250.  Once the culture is put at 110 RPM and 37C, it is Time Zero

4. After x hours (for x=4 to x=12), extract 25 mL culture from master culture, pour into 125-mL flask, and add 13.6 uL to it for both J45200 and J45250 (grow up at 110 RPM)

5. At hour x+3 for hour x, GC extract culture

=Method 11/30=

Started Indole-Knockout and Top10 25-mL cultures (in 250-mL baffled flasks at 37C at 220 RPM) to be GC extracted tomorrow- 5:30 PM

IK- 20 hr growth, OD600=3.96

Top10- 20 hr growth, OD600= 3.34

=Additional Extractions- 1/13=

With old cultures, GC extracted culture spiked with A) .457 uL IAC B) .571 uL IAC C) 1.168 uL IAC--- will see extraction efficiency- extracted 200 uL, 200 uL heptane also added

For GC vials, 150 uL of each sample added with 250 uL heptane.

Also, standards were made.

.467 uL 1:10 octyl acetate added to 400 uL samples.

NOTE- 200640 has ten times as much octyl acetate as desired.

=Other Things to Do=

1. Swing by Stephanopoulos lab to see status of the GC- DONE (bad news: delayed, needs until Saturday to set it up; good news: nobody is set up to use it, so I should be able to use it all of next week)

2. At 4:40, dilute the J45995, J45996, I7100, and B0015 cultures 1:250- SCRAP THIS (NOT ENOUGH FLASKS)

3. Ask grad students about next step in wintergreen curve production- DONE (go with gut instinct)
