MIB researchers explore a diversity of projects at the interface to biology and, as with any dynamic research centre, the research programme will evolve continually. Indeed, this flexibility will constitute a vital operational principle of the institute, allowing our research priorities to develop rapidly and flexibly in ways that complement activities in the university's Schools and Faculties. Many of our large-scale projects are widely networked within the university community. 

Our research follows five broad themes, listed here in roughly ascending order of system complexity. You will find links to a number of major research initiatives, as well as to individual group leader outlines, in the respective theme sections.

*Biomolecular Structure & Dynamics 
*Bionanoscience/engineering 
*Self-Assembling Systems 
*Biocatalysis 
*Systems Biology 

In parallel, we pursue a number of areas of: 

*Technology & Instrumentation Development
