==BAMT PCR Product Eco/Pst Digest==
'''BEGAN AT 11:15 AM'''
#We are cutting the BAMT pcr product (using EcoRI and PstI)--
#Total reaction volume is 50&mu;L
#the amount of dna desired is about 800 nanograms
#*BAMT pcr product at 58.8 ng/&mu;L -----add 13.6 &mu;L
#we are also going to use Dpn1 '''only''' in BAMT cut reaction to destroy dna that is not a pcr product (i.e. get rid of extra template)

#BAMT pcr cleanup product cut reaction:
#*28.9 &mu;L water
#*5 &mu;L NEB buffer 2
#*.5 &mu;L BSA
#*13.6 &mu;L BAMT pcr cleanup product (concentration = 50 ng/&mu;L)
#*.75 &mu;L Pst1
#*.75 &mu;L EcoR1
#*'''.5 &mu;L Dpn 1'''
#Incubate tube in 37c room for 1-6 hours, then 20 mins at 80deg C to heat inactivate the enzyme, then 4deg forever.
#Did a PCR cleanup & nanodrop: concentration of digested BAMT = ??ng/&mu;L
#'''run a gel before moving on to ligation !!'''

==New Liquid Cultures for GC==
Used 40 uL SA, 20 uL cell cultures, 10 mL LB Kan in each of the following tubes:

SAMT, not induced

BSMT, not induced

SAMT, induced

BSMT, induced

BSMT BB, induced

*Note that the SAMT and BSMT cultures were two weeks old.

==Measurement of Stationary Phase Promoter==
Francois' rpos promoter was tested on a 96-well plate for fluorescence.  The following wells were filled accordingly:

A1- 200 uL rpos promoter attached to GFP liquid culture

A2- 200 uL rpos promoter attached to GFP liquid culture

A3- 200 uL rpos promoter attached to GFP liquid culture

A4- 200 uL constitutive promoter attached to GFP liquid culture

A5- 200 uL constitutive promoter attached to GFP liquid culture

A6- 200 uL constitutive promoter attached to GFP liquid culture

A7- 200 uL LB media

A8- 200 uL LB media

A9- 200 uL LB media

We will read out the fluorescence data tomorrow.
