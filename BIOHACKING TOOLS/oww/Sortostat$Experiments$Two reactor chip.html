==7/11/07==
===7/11/07===
*cleaning period = 15.9
*same as 5/29/07, otherwise

===7/11/07b===
fluid 5.5
pushup: 19.64
pushdown: 21.80
*cleaning period = 14.8
*Focus: 1375, 1984, 2102, 3648, 4068, 5600, 6022, 7502, 8008, 9100, 9718, 9927, 11062, 13036, 13638, 13662, 15358
*1436 - Started sorting againstYFP
*9927 - turned off sorting
*13708 - started sorting againstCFP

==9/11/07==
*40 to 60% zig-zag experiment.
**If possible do pulse selection as well
*cleaning period = 15.9
*same as 5/29/07, otherwise
*Focus and flipped the 2x magnification at #63 (I was seeing cells outside the sorting chamber).

==12/2/07==
*1418 - focused
*3832 - focused for BF images.

==12/18/07==
*64 - switched to sorting against CFP, since it looked like they might be growing faster (though too early to tell, really)
*94 - turned off directional sorting
*748 - focused
*752 - directional sorting against CFP
*1321 - focused
*3228 - got through >3000 w/o a memory leak crash, as a point of reference. (though PF at 1.2MB)
*Also, note that this chip has been in constant use since 12/2 (16days), although i did have to reload the pump valves at day 14, b/c one had dried out.  I think its reasonable that we could keep a culture going in here for at least 16 days (though in this run, i swapped n new cells a couple times, though one set was in there for 10 days) - and probably for much longer if you periodically reloaded the pump valves.

==12/20/07==
*462 - directional sorting against CFP
==12/22/07==
*Using C/Y (3k3)
*Mixed CFP (OD = 0.12) and YFP (OD=0.10), so they would be present 50/50 from cultures that had been inoculated from a colony ~6 hours earlier.
*112 - turned on sorting (non-directional)
*817 focused

==12/23/07==
*200 - turned on sorting (non-directional)
*230 - focused
*494 - focused and turned on directed sorting against CFP, also turned on the "flipping" from 0.4-0.6

==12/24/07==
*20.5 cleaning period, which should be a doubling time of 0.9hr.
*368 - set to against YFP / focused
*492 - actually turned on the flipping 0.4-0.6 switch.  So should flip to against CFP very soon (if not immediately).
*1224 - focused
*1700-focused

==12/25/07==
*19.3 cleaning period, which should be a 0.85 hr doubling time.
*634 focused
* Good example of non-directional w/ sorting, however the counts for the CFP were consistently 4-5 cell high, so I changed the std_mult variable to be 5 for the 12/26 run.

==12/26/07==
*19.3 cleaning period, which should be a 0.85 hr doubling time.
*166 - focused
*564- changed to sorting against YFP (was sorting against CFP for a fair number of sorts before this)

==12/28/07==
*715 - turned on non-directional sorting
*720 - turned on directional sorting (in this case that just means selecting for GFP cells)
*1630 - focused
*3536 - focused & turned off directional sorting
*4067 - focused

==1/15/08==
*push down, push up = 20psi
*fluid = 5.6 psi

*1 - started with cleaning only
*155 - focused
*162 - turned on sorting (directional) in favor of GFP
*462 - focused (~16 total cells, 4 of which were glowing)
*524 - switched sorting to non-directional (there was a bug so didn't really)
*708 - fixed the bug in the sorting, in the process I did two cleaning events in quick succession, but I restarted at the same cleaning event it was at previously.
*1560 - changed sorting to directional in favor of GFP
*1950 - focused
*2550 - focused
*4136 - focused
*4716 - focused
*5318 - focused
