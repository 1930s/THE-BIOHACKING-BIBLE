'''See [[Reshma Shetty | Reshma]] if you have any questions/suggestions on the lab specific chemical training.'''

# Ordering Chemicals
#* Check the inventory before ordering new chemicals
#* Obtain an MSDS and review proper practices with the lab group when new chemicals are ordered
#* Put MSDS in folder kept on on the short bookshelves in the hallway between [http://www.csail.mit.edu/resources/maps/3/311.gif 32-311] and [http://www.csail.mit.edu/resources/maps/3/321.gif 32-321].
# Storage of Chemicals – incompatible chemicals (acids and flammables) cannot be stored together
#* Acids and flammable liquids are stored in separate cabinets. 
#* Solids are stored on shelves.
#* Chemical bottles stored on the floor must have secondary containers.
#* Liquid hazardous chemicals should not be stored above eye level.
#* Refrigerators are not equipped for flammable storage (when the compressor turns on, a spark can be generated, and ignition of flammable vapors can occur.)
# Chemical Labeling
#* All chemical containers (including working containers) must be labeled with the chemical name and hazard.  Chemical name abbreviations are posted on the bulletin board outside [http://www.csail.mit.edu/resources/maps/3/306.gif 32-306].  Before using an abbreviation, make sure it is on the list.  
#* Date the chemicals when they are received.  Especially peroxide forming compounds, e.g. ether and tetrahydrofuran.   Peroxide-formers should not be kept past 1 year from the date of receipt.
#* Put your name/initials on chemical containers that only you use.
# Use of Chemicals
#* Volatile hazardous chemicals must be used in the fume hood.
#* Alcohols and 3N HCl can be used on the lab bench.
#* When working with hazardous chemicals, wear lab coat, safety glasses, and gloves.  These are stored in the hall outside [http://www.csail.mit.edu/resources/maps/3/322.gif 32-322] under the metro shelves.
#* No open-toed shoes are allowed.
#* Remove gloves before handling keyboards, phones, and door knobs.
#* If using acrylamide gels, wear nitrile gloves in case there is residual acrylamide in the bag.
#* Rotovap use ethanol, therefore a trap is needed before it is connected to central vacuum 
# Fume Hood Use
#* Since fume hoods are shared please clean up after yourself and remove all chemicals from the hood when you are through.  Cluttered hoods block the airflow, as a result chemical vapors are not contained well.   Please keep the hood clear of unnecessary equipment and chemical bottles.
#* For the best protection from chemical vapors, keep chemicals and equipment at least 6-inches into the hood.  Always work with the sash in the lowest position possible.  
#* Please close the sash when the hood is not in use.
# Hazardous waste
#* See [[Knight:Chemical_waste | information]] on disposing of hazardous waste. 
#* The satellite accumulation areas are in the following locations:
## 32-322 in the fume hood
## 32-316 on the table.  (Ethidium bromide waste only.  This waste will be phased out as we switch over completely to SYBR safe.)
#* The EHS representative ([[Reshma Shetty]]) is required to do weekly inspections of the Satellite Accumulation Area.  Please ask your EHS representative or Kathy Gilbert from the EHS Office (x3-8409) if you have any questions regarding hazardous waste.
#* The first rinsate of empty chemical bottles must be collected as hazardous waste.
#* Materials used to clean up chemical spills are hazardous waste.
# Gas Cylinders
#* Secure with strap or chain (1/2 to 2/3 of the way up).
#* Use correct regulator and gauge.
#* Wear safety glasses when working with compressed gases.  These are stored in the hall outside [http://www.csail.mit.edu/resources/maps/3/322.gif 32-322] under the metro shelves.
# Emergencies
#* Please review the emergency flip chart that is posted outside the doors to any of the labs.  For major emergencies, dial 100 from a campus phone.
#* Familiarize yourself with the [http://www.csail.mit.edu/resources/emergency/maps/3Floor.jpg Stata third floor evacuation map].
#* If the building is evacuated, report to the following location:
## [http://whereis.mit.edu/map-jpg?selection=P9&Parking=go Biology parking lot] (between bldg 68 and bldg 32)
## Back up location in case of bad weather: [http://whereis.mit.edu/map-jpg?mapterms=68&mapsearch=go Bldg 68] lobby
#* Know the difference between minor and major chemical spills.
#* MIT policy is to not fight fires.  Only use fire extinguishers to aid your exit from the building.
#* Learn the location of emergency equipment

# Please avoid the following:
#* Fireboys near paper or opened bottles of ethanol could cause a fire.  Make sure your fireboy is not underneath a shelf when on (it will burn the underside of the shelf. 
#* Orphan Chemicals are chemicals that are unlabeled and must be disposed of as hazardous waste.  This may cost several thousand dollars to have analysed to determine the characteristics of the unknown waste.
# Other safety issues
#* Follow the instructions for proper disposal of [[Knight:Biohazardous waste | biohazardous waste]].
#* Follow the instructions for proper disposal of [[Knight:Electronics waste | electronics waste]].
#* Place sharps in labelled sharps containers.  See the detailed instructions for proper disposal of [[Knight:Sharps | sharps]]. 
#* No food or drink in the lab (including gum or candy).  Don't throw out food containers in lab trash cans.
#* Boxes cannot be stored within 18 inches of sprinkler heads.  
#* Tripping hazards – avoid leaving anything on the floor in hallways including electrical and phone cords.
#* Electrical safety – do not daisy-chain extension cords.
