Welcome to the 2007 Meeting Student Poster Page.
If you do not have an account please create one by clicking on the log in/create account button in the top right of your browser.  Once you do have an account please upload your poster by using the upload file link on the lower left menu of this page(under toolbox), and place a link on this page.  Several different formats can be used to upload your poster file.  The poster can be uploaded as a powerpoint, but this file cannot be viewed inside the internet browser window.  By saving your poster as a jpeg, your file can be previewed as in the example below.  The suggested poster name for the uploaded file is: <nowiki>IBE2007Meeting'SchoolName''PosterName'.jpg</nowiki>.
*note: I have had a little bit of trouble when saving my powerpoint as a jpg as it tends to try and scale the text down.  I avoided this problem by saving the file as a pdf, and then using the capture function within adobe acrobat reader and pasting within a photo editing program.  From there I could save the poster at 33% of the original size where the text was still viewable but the file size was somewhat reduced.
*Thanks Missouri Western and Davidson!
