Abstract

<p>The design of a microbioreactor is described.
An optical sensing system was used for continuous measurements
of pH, dissolved oxygen, and optical density
in a 2 mL working volume. The KLa of the microbioreactor
was evaluated under different conditions. An Escherichia
coli fermentation in both the microbioreactor and
a standard 1 L bioreactor showed similar pH, dissolved
oxygen, and optical density profiles.
The low cost of the microbioreactor, detection system,
and the small volume of the fermentation broth provide
a basis for development of a multiple-bioreactor system
for high-throughput bioprocess optimization. © 2001 John
