==Chemical Transport==
* Glucose as example
* Transport appears faster than expected from diffusion (Transport is ''facilitated'')
** About <math>10^5</math> speedup
* Structure specific
** similar sugars transported very differently
* Transport saturates
* Can be inhibited by other solutes (not independent)
* Drugs can completely block transport
* hormonal control, highly regulated (e.g. insulin)

==Model==
* Transport by membrane protein
* binds solute, flips, releases solute on other side
* protein can flip with or without solute
* cannot treat individual solute molecules independently as they are competing for the protein
* flipping is treated as simple first order reversible reaction
** <math>R\ \overrightarrow{\leftarrow}\ P</math> with a forward rate constant of <math>\alpha</math> and reverse rate constant of <math>\beta</math>
** At equilibrium, the relatve concentrations of product P to reactant R will be the association constant <math>K_a = \frac{\alpha}{\beta}</math> 
** the kinetics are exponential with a time constant <math>\tau = \frac{1}{\alpha+\beta}</math>
* binding reaction
** <math>S+E\ \overrightarrow{\leftarrow}\ ES</math>
** law of mass action, rate depends on product of concentrations
** Will usually use dissociation constant <math>K=\frac{1}{K_a}</math> (units concentration)
** total enzyme <math>C_{ET}=C_E+C_{ES}</math> is constant
** Michaelis-Menten (hyperbolic) kinetics of form <math>y=\frac{a}{a+x}</math>
** when drawn on doubly reciprocal coordinates, get straight line
