====Colony PCR's====
George, Stephanie, and Perry ran colony PCR's on the constructs that Perry and Stephanie transformed on the previous Friday. 
 
The following colonies turned out to be correct:
*[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_J06702 J06702], colony #2

====Plate Reader====
Stephanie made 1:20 dilutions into 200 and grew samples of [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_T9002 T9002] (both {incubated overnight with 100nM OHHL} and {incubated overnight without induction}), 

[[Shlo/notebook#Plate_Reader|Stephanie's notebook entry]]

Unfortunately, the results/data for this experiment were lost due to Windows automatically restarting itself and not saving any data.

====More Colony PCR's====
Stephanie, Perry, and George ran more colony PCR's. The parts were split up into three gels, with different extension times for each gel group:
*Group 1: 1m15s extension
**[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_F2620 F2620]
**[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_B0015 B0015]

Results:
The following parts ended up being correct:

====Setting Up the Overnight Fluorescent Plate Reader====
Stephanie set up the plate reader for an overnight plate reader experiment with:
*[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_T9002 T9002], [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_I13273 I13273], and [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_F2620 F2620] > [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_E0240 E0240] all either induced with 100 nM or not induced
*[http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_J23039 J23039] > [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_T9002 T9002]

All the above samples were 200 ÂµL cultures of 1:100 dilutions of overnight liquid cultures. In addition, Stephanie ran six samples of the [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_J23039 J23039] > [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_T9002 T9002] that were prepared by dipping a colony swab into 200 ÂµL of LB medium.

[[Shlo/notebook#Setup_for_Overnight_Plate_Reader|Stephanie's notebook entry]]

====FACS setup====
The following parts were taken from overnight cultures, diluted 1:20, grown for one hour (at which point they reached the indicated OD's), and then induced with 100 nM OHHL. The original plan was to spin down and resuspend in PBA at two hours and four hours after induction. However, we forgot to put the cells in the incubator after the two hour sample, so we only had the two hour sample. The parts:

The [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_T9002 T9002] (+) was an overnight culture that was induced the day before. According to Stephanie, "Interestingly, the T9002 (+) had relatively little fluorescence compared to the constitutve samples. Perhaps the fluorescence had started to decrease over time, or perhaps the T9002 was not activated that strongly ... this is something we can measure over time with the plate reader ... if it does not turn off again and lose our data."

====Dephosphorylation of P0140, P0340, R0011, and R0051====
George vacufuged the results of the clonewell on 7/12/07 down to a high concentration. Then he treated the DNA with Antarctic Phophatase. Finally, he heat inactivated the mix (10 min at 65dC).

This was done in preparation for making the constitutive tetR+JT construct.
