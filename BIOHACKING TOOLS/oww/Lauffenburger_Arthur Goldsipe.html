The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, like the JNK pathway, plays an important role in varied cellular responses, including apoptosis, stress response, and inflammation. p38 and its downstream proteins are promising targets for inhibitors in the treatment of inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. I am interested in developing computational and mathematical models to gain insight into the p38 pathway. Initially, I plan to combine ODE models with machine learning to gain insight into the factors that control the response of the p38 pathway.
