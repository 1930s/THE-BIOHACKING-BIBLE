=PREPARATION OF SMALL UNILAMELLAR VESICLES=
==Abstract==
This procedure details how small (~35-100 nm diameter) unilamellar vesicles can be formed by extrusion.

==Materials==
===Reagents===
*Lipids (usually egg PC and 1-2 mole % dye) 
*Wide-mouth screw top glass vials, ~ 10 mL
*ICN 7x detergent, i.e MP Biomedicals catalog # 097667093
*Millipore water
*Acetone
*Chloroform
*Absolute ethanol
*N2(g)
*Kimwipes

===Equipment===
*50 uL Hamilton syringe, to be used for lipids only
*250 uL Hamilton syringe, to be used for lipids only 
*Hot plate
*Extruder, e.g. mini-extruder from Avanti Polar Lipids
*Filter supports
*Polycarbonate membranes
*Clean dessicator free from desiccant
*Vortex

==Procedure==
#Clean glass vials.  Immerse vials in 20-30% 7x detergent (70-80% distilled water) that has been heated until clear (~90ºC) for 5 minutes.  Rinse thoroughly with double distilled water.  Rinse three times with acetone, then three times with chloroform.  Dry with N2(g).
#Add appropriate quantities of lipids in chloroform to clean glass vials.  It is recommended that you keep a set of syringes to be used only for lipids.
#Dry the lipids down with N2(g).  Ideally, the lipids will form a thin, transparent, uniform film over much of the interior glass surface.  
#Dry the lipids under vacuum for 1 hour.  If this is done in a desiccator, do not use desiccant.
#Rehydrate the lipids in buffer or Millipore water to ~10 mg/mL.  Vortex the solution to redissolve as much lipid material as possible. The lipid/aqueous solution should result appear cloudy. Allow lipids to rehydrate for 15 min before extruding.
#Clean the components of extruder. Rinse pieces with absolute ethanol, allow to dry on Kimwipes, and repeat.
#Assemble the extruder with filter supports (4 total) and polycarbonate membranes (2 total). See extruder instructions for more details. 
#Rinse the assembled extruder with Millipore water three times to remove any air bubbles.
#Pass the lipid solution ~20 times through the polycarbonate membranes.  You should feel slight resistance when pushing the syringes, and the lipid solution should become transparent (vs. opaque).
#Store the vesicles at 4ºC.  
#Rinse the disassembled extruder first with water, then with ethanol. Allow to dry on Kimwipes.

==Critical Steps==
*Cleanliness of the glass vials is very important. It is crucial that there is no visible aqueous liquid in the glass vials before addition of the lipids in chloroform.
*Having a uniform film of lipids on the interior of the glass vial makes rehydration of the lipids easier.

==Troubleshooting==
*The inability to form a uniform lipid film can be an indication that the glass vial is not sufficiently clean.
*Sometimes excessive pressure can build up in the extruder, and passing the lipid solution through the membrane requires a great deal of force. When this occurs, remove the lipid solution from the syringe, re-assemble of the extruder with fresh filter supports and polycarbonate membranes, and re-extrude the lipid solution.
*If the lipid solution does not become clear and/or it requires very, very little force to pass the lipid solution through the extruder, then it is possible that the polycarbonate membranes have developed a tear. After completing 20 extrusions, disassemble the polycarbonate and check for a tear. If one is present, re-extrude the lipid solution.
 
==Notes==
*It is important to use lipid compositions which are in the liquid phase at the temperature which the vesicles are formed. Since egg PC is fluid to ~-10C, vesicles of egg PC can be created at room temperature and stored at 4C. Other compositions may require handling at different temperatures.
