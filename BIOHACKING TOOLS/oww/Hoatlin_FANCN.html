==Summary==
*colocalizes with the DNA repair protein BRCA2
*not in the Fanconi nuclear ‘core complex’ 
*monoubiquitination of FANCD2 is unaffected by defects in the gene coding for FANCN 
*new Fanconi anemia complementation group, FA-N
*sequence alterations in FANCN cause reduced detection of BRCA2 and sensitivity to crosslinking agents, which is typical for Fanconi patients.  
*size of protein-1186 amino acids or 130 kDa
*number of nucs-3,552
*antibody against the N terminus and central region (amino acids 601-880)
*seq online in other species?
==Mutations==
*8 patients known to have FANCN mutations
*bialleic 
*premature stop codon very close to the C-terminus causing non-functioning protein truncations
*critical tyrosine residue at C-terminus-Y1183X
