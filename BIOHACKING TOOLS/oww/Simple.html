1.	Choose desired slides (paraformaldyhyde-fixed, 10 micron thick crysections).

2.	Leave the chosen slides at room temperature just until the frost melts.

3.	Rinse the slides 3 times in 1x TBST for 8 minutes each. 

4.	Block with 5% milk powder in 1x TBST for 30 minutes at room temperature. Optional: 1-2% BSA can be added to TBST.

5.	Incubate overnight at 4oC with primary antibodies in TBST plus 5% milk.

6.	Rinse for 10 seconds, 1x TBST. Then, rinse 3 times in 1x TBST for 8 minutes each.

7.	Add secondary antibodies in TBST for 1 hour at room temperature in the dark.

8.	Rinse 3 times in 1x TBS for 8 minutes each.

9.	Add Fluorescent Mounting Medium, coverslip, and examine under a fluorescent microscope.

10.	Lastly, seal the edges of covered-slip slides with a clear nail polish. This helps slides retain fluorescence longer during storage.
