==to do==
#find a new glycerol storage box and transfer 7/29's new glycerols into it '''-done'''
#nanodrop 23 minipreps from 7/29 and prepare 46 small tubes for sequencing order '''-done'''
#*sequence results from tubes 23/24, 27/28 have been discarded b/c we do not have enough dna
#troubleshoot pchBA (w/out silent mutation) PCR
#digestions+ligations+transformations (design a plan)
#get ready to fax offices about p. shuttle vectors '''-done, need Isadora'''
#link our system device diagrams on main wiki page '''-done'''

==Current products (sequence results to verify will come in on wed 8/2)==
#RBS-CDS<sub>BSMT</sub>-Term
#RBS-ATF1<sub>mut</sub>
#SPP-RBS-GFP-Term
#ATF1<sub>mut</sub>-Term

==Digestions (and gel extractions)==
#RBS<sub>30, 32</sub>-CDS-Term: XP
#RBS<sub>30, 32</sub>-ATF1: ES
#osmY: SP
#ATF1+Term: XP
#R0040: SP
#E0840: XP

==Digests needed for ligation in our possession==
#B0015: EX
#B0030: SP
#B0032: SP

==Gel Extraction==
#RBS-CDS-Term: XP 30ABC came out 
#E0840: XP also came out
#RBS-ATF1: ES30/32 AB

==pchBA PCR==
Ran pchBA PCR with gradient -- unsuccessful again. We need advisor help.

==BAT2 and THI3 PCR (and gel)==
#primers recieved, 55 degree/standard PCR program

==Sequencing Results==
Looked at R40 + B30/32 sequencing results. Seems that the promoter is missing and we will be going with different set of ligations.

==liquid cultures==
#R0040
#osmY+E0840(A,B,C)
#ROO30+ATF1<sub>mut</sub>(A,B,C)
