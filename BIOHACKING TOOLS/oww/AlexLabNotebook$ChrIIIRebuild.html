= Chromosome rebuild =
Assertion: Will rebuild chromosome III, because that's the one that's best-studied

''Proposed schedule'':
* Complete chr III independent functional element list by 10/7
* Put together ~20K long sequence for pilot project by 10/14
* Figure out actual recombination & selection steps, send sequence out for synthesis by 10/30

''Currently working on'': Making list of independent functional elements.

* 09/05
**[[AlexLabNotebook/ChrIIIRebuild/9/19/05-9/23/05|9/19/05-9/23/05]]: Made list of all features on chromosome III, started to gather data about how to define 5' and 3' ends of genes. 
**[[AlexLabNotebook/ChrIIIRebuild/9/24/05-9/30/05|9/24/05-9/30/05]]: Generated initial list of overlapping regions, figured out flanking sequences needed for Ty elements [none], sent gene sequences off to Joel Graber for 3' end prediction, started to look into ways to define 5' gene ends. 
* 10/05
**[[AlexLabNotebook/ChrIIIRebuild/10/1/05-10/7/05|10/1/05-10/7/05]]: Downloaded conservation scores for [almost] all positions on chr III, generated conservation "profile" for all intergenic regions, used Pychart to generate plots of these profiles.
