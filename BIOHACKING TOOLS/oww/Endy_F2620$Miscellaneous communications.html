==IBE Abstract==
Characterization of BBa_F2620, an engineered cell-cell communication  device

Current research in synthetic biology aims to enable the design and  construction of living organisms in the manner that we now engineer  electrical, mechanical, and other systems. To facilitate design of  higher-order systems, we need to be able to predict the behavior of a  system from the characteristics of the components that might comprise  it. Thus, designing and using a methodology for characterizing the  performance of biological parts and devices is central to the future  success of biological engineering. Here, we engineered a cell-cell  communication device, BBa_F2620, based on parts from the quorum  sensing system of Vibrio fischeri [1].  BBa_F2620 is a receiver  device that responds to the concentration of a small signaling  molecule (AHL) in the media by modulating the transcription rate that  is output from the device. To begin to systematically characterize  BBa_F2620, we connected it upstream of BBa_E0240, a fluorescent  protein-based reporter device, and measured the following properties:  device INPUT/OUTPUT transfer function (including switch point,  latency, and variation across clonal colonies), input signal  specificity, and device stability (both genetic and performance).  We  used this data in conjunction with a simple mathematical model to  define the output of BBa_F2620 in terms of PoPS, a common signal  carrier for gene expression, and to populate a first-generation  datasheet that describes the use and operation of BBa_F2620.  We hope  that the biological engineering community will begin to work together  to populate a library of well-characterized devices in a manner  similar to that described here, and propose that a standards  committee for device characterization be started in support of such  work.

[1] BBa_F2620 is made using the following standard biological parts:  BBa_R0040, B0034, C0062, B0015 and R0062.  All parts are available  via the Registry of Standard Biological Parts, http://parts.mit.edu/
