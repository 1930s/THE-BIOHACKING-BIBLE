#16 minipreps of pchBA-B0015 muts
#digestions:
#*pchBA-B0015 muts with: XP (RUN A GEL!! b/c pchA has a PstI site)
#ligations: all good
#transformations: on A/C plates


==IAGD stuff==
#digestions:
#*good 30-Bat2-30 with: ES- i'd still do this and ligate it to thi3
#*THI3 with: XP

#Kate: minipreps of pchBA and LC/glycerol of Q04400 and pUCP22 -'''done'''
#*miniprepped 15 pchBA-B0015 muts plus Q04400 -- all good concentrations. i re-labeled the muts 1-15. do not bleach the LC tubes so that we can keep track of the ABC system if needed.
#*Veena: did not make any glycerols b/c it makes sense to wait and glycerol good ones after reading gel in pm
#*Veena/Stephen: did not select colonies for LCs b/c it is too early (risk overgrowing Kate/Bo think) so have labeled and poured 21 LC tubes with proper LB -- if someone in pm could put in colonies would be good
#*Call me with any questions
#Stephen: plate reader and osmY analysis (+ sunday) 
#Andre: LCs of IK plates and Glycerols of IK cells without substrate, smelling of IK cells with substrate, set-up new experiments (??)
#Bo: 18 digests, pour and load 2 gels
#Veena: read gel, design good ligations (remember to connect both RBS), ligate, transformation
