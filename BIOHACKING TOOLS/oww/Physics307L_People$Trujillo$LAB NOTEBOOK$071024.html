===Speed Of Light=== 
(week 1)

'''NOTES:'''

Set up as described in the lab procedure. Tomas and I verified that the PMT was operating (green light seen).

'''Set Up'''

LED pulser voltage:
153.9

With the O Scope, we verified the start and stop TAC signals. We also measured a pulse frequency of 8.4kHHz. We adjusted the PMT voltage to get the pulse frequency of exactly 10.01kHz (+/- .02kHz)

System Calibration:
We will use the delay box got measure the insertion loss. The TAC seems to be working and we confirmed the delay box works by using the MCA. The histogram shifts when a delay switch is turned (YES!). After configuring the MCA we started taking cal data

'''TAC Settings/High Voltage for PMT'''

Range = 100

Multiplier = 1

SCA Window = 811

SCA Lower Level = 48

Start and Stop = Anti

Output = Out

Voltage = 1500 + 497.1

The curves we were seeing from the MCA looked Poissonish.
