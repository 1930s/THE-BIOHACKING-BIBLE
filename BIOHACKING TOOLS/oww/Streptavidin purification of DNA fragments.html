==Biotin Primers==

* Make primers for PCR reactions with a 5' biotin modification
** HPLC purification of these primers is desirable to eliminate short primers and ones without a biotin tag
** Virtually all oligo manufacturers can supply 5' biotin
** An alternative is to make 5' amine primers and link biotin to the amine group

==PCR Reaction==
* Normal PCR reaction conditions apply.
* Approximately 1 pmol/&mu;l biotinylated primer should be used.


* 100 &mu;l reaction
* 100 &mu;l PCR Supermix High Fidelity (Invitrogen)
* 1.5 &mu;l Suffix-FB biotinylated primer (30 pmol/&mu;l)
* 1.5 &mu;l Prefix-RB biotinylated primer (30 pmol/&mu;l)
* 0.5 &mu;l diluted plasmid backbone template DNA (10 ng/&mu;l)


* Cycle 36x
* initial denature 95&deg; 2 min
* 36 cycles
** 95&deg; 20 sec
** 62&deg; 20 sec
** 68&deg; 4:00 min 
* final extension 68&deg; 20 min

==Post PCR Cleanup==
* Elimination of PCR enzymes and dNTPs is required prior to enzymatic cutting
* Add 1 &mu;l Proteinase-K
* digest at 50&deg; for 1 hour
* heat kill Proteinase K at 80&deg; for 20 minutes
* Add 5x (500 &mu;l) Qiagen buffer PB, vortex
* Spin in Qiagen column at 8000g 1 minute
* Pour flow through back into the column, spin again
* Discard flow through, add 500 &mu;l buffer PB, spin again
* Discard flow through, add 750 &mu;l wash PE, spin again
* Discard flow through, add 750 &mu;l wash PE, spin again
* Discard flow through, spin again at 12000g, 2 minutes to dry
* Transfer column to a clean 1.7 ml tube, add 30 &mu;l EB heated to 50&deg;, spin at 8000g 1 minute
* Add a further 30 &mu;l EB, spin again
* Discard the column and retain the eluted DNA
* measure yield with the Nanodrop, expect 150-250 ng/&mu;l in 45 &mu;l

==Restriction digests==
* Digest in a 300 &mu;l final volume
* Initial DNA is 45 &mu;l from the elution
* Add 30 &mu;l Buffer 2
* Add 3 &mu;l BSA
* Add 212 &mu;l DI water
* Add 5 &mu;l EcoRI
* Add 5 &mu;l PstI
* Add 1 &mu;l DpnI
* Digest 2 hours at 37&deg;
* Heat kill 20 minutes at 80&deg;

==Binding and removing uncut DNA and short ends to streptavidin-agarose==
* For binding uncut and short fragments, the salt concentration must be increased.
** Adjust restriction digest to 1 M NaCl by adding 60 &mu;l of 5M NaCl
* During the binding reaction, the exposed cut ends must be protected from exonucleases by removing the magnesium
** Chelate Mg<sup>++</sup> by adding 20 &mu;l of 500 mM EDTA
* Use Pierce Streptavidin-agarose beads, Pierce 20349 [[http://www.piercenet.com/files/0187as4.pdf]]
** These have high capacity, around 75 pmol/&mu;l
* Dispense 100 &mu;l of the settled beads into a 2 ml tube
* Add 1.7 ml of binding buffer, resuspending the beads
* Wash 30 minutes at room temperature with agitation
* Centrifuge at 8000g for 1 minute
* Discard the supernatent
* Add 1.7 ml of binding buffer, resuspending the beads
* Wash for 30 minutes at room temperature with agitation
* Centrifuge at 8000g for 1 minute
* Discard the supernatent
* Add 300 &mu;l of binding buffer and resuspend the beads
* Add the cut and adjusted PCR product (380 &mu;l)
* Bind overnight at room temperature with agitation
* Centrifuge at 8000g for 1 minute in a Bio101 spin filter cartridge
* Discard the filter
* Add 1 &mu;l of pellet-paint
* Add 500 &mu;l of isopropanol and mix
* Freeze for 30 minutes at -80&deg; to form a gel
* Centrifuge at 17000g for 30 minutes to precipitate the recovered DNA
* Wash the DNA pellet with 70% ethanol
* Resuspend the purified DNA in 50 &mu;l TE
* Quantitate the DNA
** expect about a 50% yield over the purified PCR product (3 to 6 &mu;g total, 50 to 150 ng/&mu;l)

==Testing the purified DNA==
* Mix a master ligation mix containing
** 250 ng of DNA
** 7.5 &mu;l T4 DNA ligase buffer
** water to 75 &mu;l
* Set aside 15 &mu;l as a reference band A and add to it 1 &mu;l of 500 mM EDTA to remove magnesium
* Add 0.3 &mu;l T4 DNA ligase
* Restriction enzymes require some salt for activity
** Adjust salt concentration to 25 mM by addition of 1.6 &mu;l of 1 M NaCl, mix
* Aliquot 15 &mu;l samples to tubes B, C, D, and E
** Add  0.3 &mu;l EcoRI to sample C
** Add  0.3 &mu;l PstI to sample D
** Add  0.3 &mu;l EcoRI and 0.3 &mu;l PstI to sample E
* Ligate 60 minutes at 16&deg;
* Cut for 10 minutes at 37&deg; 
* Heat kill for 20 minutes at 80&deg;
* Run an 0.8% gel
** Ligated band B should show little single length fragment and a high MW smear, with some double and quad length fragments
** Ligated and single cut bands C and D should show double length fragments
