|Notes about labs
|OK
|Give more of a spiel about personal safety.  Then give advice about being very careful with instruments.
|
|-
|terminology: accuracy, precision, errors
|OK
|
|
|-
|terminology: deviation
|bad
|don't try to explain standard deviation off the cuff and only partially. Save it for a real thorough discussion
|
|-
|terminology: mean, media, mode
|OK
|use official definitions, be concise
|
|-
|mean +/- error
|Good
|we used the actual oscilloscope lab data and I think had a very enlightening discussion about how to assess the quality of data and whether it is OK to throw data out.  How to be objective.  I think this was a good lesson.  We also by hand constructed a histogram, which maybe was useful, maybe not.
