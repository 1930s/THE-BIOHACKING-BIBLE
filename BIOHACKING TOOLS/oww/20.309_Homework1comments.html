Here are a few comments based on common problems in the homework assignment:

*Always label and draw in currents that you are using in a calculation.  Because the direction of current is by definition this is especially important for understanding how a problem was (or was attempted to be) solved.

*When graphing a quantity x vs y, typically the independant variable is plotted on the x-axis.  In the case of diode IV-curves, this would be the voltage (V).  

*On IV-curves for diodes, the full characteristic can be visualized if all biases (positive and negative) are plotted on one set of (4-quadrant) axis.

*The homework grade is out of 40 points.
