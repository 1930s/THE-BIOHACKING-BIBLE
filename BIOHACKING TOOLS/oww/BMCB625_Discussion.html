==Suggestions about how to run the next session==
#As noted last week, on Wednesday's class, spend approximately 20-30 minutes answering "questions posed" about the previous week's presentations.  This will reinforce what was learned the previous week, and potentially act as a trasition to that day's discussion.  Then the remainder of the time is "up to the people presenting" (i.e., a brief discussion about topics and then one-on-one, or whatever needs to be taken care of...).

==Suggestions about how the run the next term==
#Get the list of class participants from the BMB office (this year I kept waiting for the registration list--bad idea!) and have an organizational meeting in Mid-March so that the sessions can be posted. That way the general faculty, students and postdocs can attend. Also, theoretically anyway, it would give class more time to prepare for the presentations.

#If this class can be scheduled a different quarter that would be ideal.  It's a difficult quarter to be balancing presentations with preparing for qualifying exams for 2nd years.  Other than that, I think it would be an even better class if you could attract more genetics and CDB students - again, hard to get 2nd years to commit to anything extra spring quarter.

I'll suggest this to the Curriculum steering committee. Thanks.

#I think the review session was a hit! Next time the course is offered 2 review sessions should be included (one at mid-term and one at the end).  The MC for the section should plan to run the review of that particular topic.

#Instead of having us submit questions with answers for each paper (which is too easy to be disingenuous about), I think it would facilitate active engagement of the entire class if we were to instead each propose a key discussion point and then be accountable to come prepared to lead the class in the discussion about that particular point.

just my $0.02

;concentrate on areas of expertise in the BMB faculty

#Transcription Activation (Jim Lundblad?)
#Regulation of Translation (Bill Skach?, Peter Rotwein?)

#Mechanisms and Analysis of Enzymatic Systems (put the Chemistry back into Department of Biochemistry!)
#Physical Biochemistry, ie spectroscopic analysis, protein dynamics, methods, applications, thermodynamic considerations...
#it would be useful (arguably critical!) to have (at least) a subsection that seriously delves into the critical analysis of biophysical models, for both structural models (don't take the crystallographers word for it!) and conceptual schemes (whats missing from the reaction coordinate?).
#Bioregulation Revisited- (new regulatory mechanism studied each week with a review of a classical paper and a cutting edge application)
#Signalling mechanisms- Neurochemistry: lots of exciting biochemistry happening at the synapse!
#Signalling mechanisms- Specific GPCR systems, we've learned some general paradigms, now lets be able to critically evaluate current research.

#I concur with Chayne regarding the Analysis of Enzymatic Systems and adding in "classical" biochemistry in the context of "current questions."  There is a tremendous amount to be learned from core biochemical concepts that can then be applied to a broad context in research.

#I agree with Chayne and Chris in that a broader coverage of subjects would be great.  Additionally, considering that we are biochem and mol bio students, a deeper biochemical perspective seems appropriate.
