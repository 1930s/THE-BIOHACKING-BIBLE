'''3.''' Regarding the Industry fair, there are 3 lists for which we need to work for:
* Companies plus their contacts list 
* Other non-academic contacts
* Academics: publicity, participants
* Jon Rees suggested to think again about what would be the main
interest of the companies in the field; i.e. either selling stuff or
recruiting people

committee
