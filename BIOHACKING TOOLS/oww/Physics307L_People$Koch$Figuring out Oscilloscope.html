==First, measuring basics of a wave==
# Hook up scope to measure a wave w/ BNC cables (do we want to use terminators?)
# Measure characteristics of a sine wave
#* Measure peak to peak voltage (thus amplitude) and measure the period (thus frequency)
#*# First, use the grid on the oscilloscope screen ("divisions" are the dotted lines)
#*# Next, use the cursors
#*# Finally, use the "measure" functions.

==Triggering==

==DC Offset==

==AC Coupling==
* Square wave, not pinning. 2.5 Hz, amplitude 8.6 +/- 0.1 V
** Fall time using cursors:
**# 61 ms; w/ measure (60 +/- 0.5) ms
**# 62 ms
**# 61 ms
* What RC constant does this imply, and what is the TDS 1002 supposed to be?
* AC coupling mystery: Max DC offset, 2.5 Hz, max amplitude (so it's pinning at 13V): Ask students to explain what is going on.

==FFT==
# Find the frequency of a sine wave using FFT "Math" function
# Look at the harmonics in triangle and square wave
# Compare with what you see on this applet: [http://www.falstad.com/fourier/ Fourier series applet]
