==Today's meeting==

Action items and things to decide on

#Course of action with indole strain
#Transcriptional activity of regulators: R0040, osmY promoter, osmY.inverter
##Verify constructs via streaking, antibiotic tests, pick a colony, grow culture, miniprep and sequence
##Repeat plate reader experiments
#GC-MS testing of constructs
##Specify all controls
#Standard curves for smell tests and GC-MS experiments

==Today==

Miniprepped and sequenced new J45700, J45800, new J45600, and new pBANANAs.- DONE  

CONSTITUTIVE AUTONOMOUS BANANA GENERATOR SMELLED!!!

We think that the other constructs may have smelled faint as well.

Streaked the R0040.E0840, osmY.E0840 (Short), osmY.E0840 (Long), and osmY.inverter.E0840 constructs on plates (antibiotic test)- DONE (ALTHOUGH I COULD NOT FIND osmY.E0840 (Long), will search again tomorrow

ALSO I FINALLY FOUND PREFERRED INDOLE-KNOCKOUT STRAIN- I did an antibiotic resistance test on these cells as well and grew a LC directly from the glycerol- DONE
