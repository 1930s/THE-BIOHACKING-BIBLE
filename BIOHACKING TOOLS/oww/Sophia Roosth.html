I went to high school in Dallas, TX.  At [http://www.rice.edu Rice University], I pursued a degree in anthropology.  My honors thesis, "Exhibiting Life: Biotechnological Media and Materiality in Bioart," examined the artistic use of biological materials to critique the biotechnology industry, offering laypeople immediate and tactile representations of biotechnical entities.  

After graduating in 2003, I began working for [http://xdesign.ucsd.edu Natalie Jeremijenko], writing for the [http://xdesign.ucsd.edu/biotechhobbyist/ Biotech Hobbyist Magazine], doing research for the Feral Robotic Dogs project, and helping organize the Clear Skies project and the OneTree(s)/TwoWheels Bike Tour.

I am currently a fourth-year doctoral candidate in the [http://web.mit.edu/hasts/ HASTS Program] at [http://web.mit.edu/ MIT].  My current research focuses on the anthropology of the contemporary life sciences, specifically synthetic biology, biological temporality, cellular acoustics, and the human sensorium. You can find my HASTS page [http://web.mit.edu/hasts/graduate/roosth.html here].

I like to talk to these guys: [http://openwetware.org/wiki/Synthetic_Society Synthetic Society], and these: [http://anthropos-lab.net/bio-nano/ "On the Assembly of Things" blog] at [http://anthropos-lab.net/collaborations/ ARC].

My previous doctoral research includes: 
* The role of Material Transfer Agreements in standardizing and privatizing the exchange of biological materials 
* Historical intersections of biology and cybernetics
* The use of acoustic technologies in nanotech laboratories (sonocytology) 
* Epistemological consequences of reengineering biological smells (see MIT's 2006 [http://openwetware.org/wiki/IGEM:MIT/2006 iGEM project]). <br>
