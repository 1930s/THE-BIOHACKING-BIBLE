====2nd Year====
'''Required Classes'''
;[http://www.ohsu.edu/biochem/grad/coursedetail.cfm?courseID=33 BCMB 619]: Designed for 2nd year BMB students to hone their presentation skills, specifically, how to present scientific data clearly, concisely and accurately.
;[http://www.ohsu.edu/biochem/grad/coursedetail.cfm?courseID=30 BMCB 607 Departmental Seminars]:  An opportunity to learn the latest research in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.  Weekly seminars are presented by local and visiting scientists.

'''Didactic Classes'''
*Fall
;Elective outside Department: Student should discuss with mentor to identify appropriate class.
*Winter
;[http://www.ohsu.edu/biochem/grad/coursedetail.cfm?courseID=34 BCMB 620]: Membrane Biochemistry. The composition of biological membranes and the functional aspects of their composition; models of membrane structure, membrane function, and mechanisms of membrane transport.
*Spring
;[http://openwetware.org/wiki/BMCB625 Advanced Molecular Biology: Topics and Methods in Modern Molecular Biology]:  An advanced graduate course with an emphasis on the latest research from the primary literature along with in-depth presentation of the basic concepts of biochemistry and molecular biology. Topics will be chosen from areas of expertise among the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology faculty, including properties of nucleotides and nucleic acids, the composition and structure of eukaryotic chromatin, eukaryotic gene expression, DNA replication, RNA transcription, RNA splicing and metabolism, and protein translation.
*Summer
;Scientific Writing Class: This course is an in-depth professional science writing course open to all OHSU researchers. The writing program has two main elements: the weekly two-hour seminar and the weekly individual tutorial.

====3rd Year ?????====
;[http://www.ohsu.edu/biochem/grad/coursedetail.cfm?courseID=35 BCMB 621] : Biophysical chemistry of macromolecules. Prequisites, Physical Chemistry or Approval of Course Director. David Farrens to email students about Physical Chemistry background.
