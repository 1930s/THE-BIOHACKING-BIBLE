==About==

Interactions between cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) play pivotal roles in directing 
cellular and tissue functions.  However, due to the ultra complexity of biological systems, 
our current understanding of cell-ECM processes and our capability to control the relevant 
events have been rather limited.  By integrating our knowledge in material science and 
engineering, microfabrication and biology, our research is aimed at generating engineered 
extracellular microenvironment for understanding and controlling cell behavior.  Experiments 
are designed to facilitate the analysis and identification of essential extracellular cues, 
which can be further applied to 2-D and 3-D artificial systems to monitor, trigger or modulate
biological processes.  On one application front, our materials and devices are geared toward 
controlling stem cell fate and directing stem cell differentiation for use of regenerative 
medicine. On another application front, it is our interest to build targeted and triggerable 
delivery systems for therapeutic compounds/cells to improve treatment outcomes.
