Abstract:

<br>A low-cost, gated system for measurements of phosphorescence lifetimes is
presented. An extensive description of the system operating principles and metrological
characteristics is given. Remarkably, the system operates without optical filtering of the LED
excitation source. A description of a practical system is also given and its performance is
discussed. Because the device effectively suppresses high-level background fluorescence and
scattered light, it is expected to find wide-spread application in bioprocess, environmental
and biomedical fields.
