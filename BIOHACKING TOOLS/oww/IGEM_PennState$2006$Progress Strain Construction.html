Our system required knockouts of RecA, LacI, and MotB.  At the same time we had to have all the rest of the cell machinery for motility.  Therefore we first started with a motile strain of bacterium RP437 which had MotB already knocked out.  To knockout LacI we used the method shown above to insert Kan resistence into the center of the LacI gene, then by removing the Kan resistence the gene was no longer functional.  Repeating this step with RecA would give us the construct that our bacterial relay race circuit required.
