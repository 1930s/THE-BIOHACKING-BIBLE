* w/ Svante Pavo

== Words to Look Up ==
* allele frequency spectrum
* Gegenbauer polynomials
* Fesenstein's law - 'Everything that is true is obvious.'

== Talk ==
* summarize large amount polymorphic sequence data from species
* sample N chromosomes - f_i density of sites i at which i chromosomes carry derived allele
* consider allele freq spectrum in light of dna sequence of closely-related species
** neanderthal and human
* whether neanderthal carriers derived allele or ancestral allele
** use chimpanzee as an outgroup to decide which is derived and which ancestral
* use Kimura's diffusion equation on 2 branches - look at joint spectrum
** assumes randomly mating population
* in case where have derived allele in neanderthal
** freq spectrum in species 1 is uniform - indep of pop size and history of pop sizes
* separated for longer-longer periods - more independant distributions
* when sample single chrom of neanderthal - as if sampled single chrom from humans
