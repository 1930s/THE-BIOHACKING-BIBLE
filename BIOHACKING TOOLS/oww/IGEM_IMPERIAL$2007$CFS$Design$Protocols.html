===Day 1===

====Equipment====
*37°C shaking incubator
*1L conical flasks x 3
*Pipette fillers + pipettes (5ml, 10ml and 25ml)
*Spectrometer + cuvettes
*Weighing scale
*Centrifuge + 150ml centrifuge tubes
*Pipettes + pipette tips (20µl, 200µl and 1000µl)

====Reagent====
*2xYT medium
*IPTG
*Buffer A
**10mM Tris-acetate (pH 8.2)
**14mM Mg-acetate
**60mM K-lutamate
**1mM dithiothreitol (DTT)
**0.05% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME)

====Procedure====
'''Growing the cells'''
#Grow ''E. coli'' strain BL21 (DE3) cells at 37°C in 3L of 2xYT medium till O.D.600 = 0.6.'''Ensure vigorous agitation and aeration.'''
#Add 1mM IPTG to cell culture to express T7 RNA polymerase.
#Harvest cells when O.D.600 = 4.5. '''At this point, cells are at mid-log phase.'''
#Wash cells three times by suspending them in 20ml of buffer A per gram of wet cells.
#Centrifuge and weigh the wet cell pellets before storing them at -80°C.
''(Note: The cells may take more than 1 day to grow to O.D.600 = 4.5.)''

===Day 2===

====Equipment====
*Pipette filler + pipettes (5ml, 10ml and 25ml)
*Weighing scale
*French press + French press cell
*Centrifuge + 50ml centrifuge tubes
*Pipette + pipette tips (20µl, 200µl, 1000µl)
*37°C shaking incubator
*Dialysis membrane with molecular weight cut-off of 10,000
*Magnetic stirrer
*4°C cold room

====Reagent====
*Buffer B
**10mM Tris-acetate (pH 8.2)
**14mM Mg-acetate
**60mM K-glutamate
**1mM DTT
*Pre-incubation solution
**293.3mM Tris-acetate (pH 8.2)
**2mM Mg-acetate

**0.04mM amino acids
**16.9mM phosphoenolpyruvate
**0.77U/ml pyruvate kinase
''(Note: For the ATP regenerating system in the pre-incubation solution, phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase are used instead of creatine phosphate and creatine kinase. This is due to cost considerations.)''

====Procedure====
'''Lysing the cells'''
#Suspend thawed cells in 12.7ml of buffer B per 10g of wet cells.
#Disrupt cells in a French press cell at a constant pressure of 20,000psi.'''This is about 140,000kPa.'''

'''Retaining the cell extract'''
#Centrifuge the crude lysate at 30,000RCF for 30min at 4°C.
#Carefully remove the top layer of the supernatant (lipid layer) and the pellet and centrifuge again.
#Shake the final supernatant at 100rpm.
#Gradually add 3ml of the pre-incubation solution to 10ml of the supernatant.
#Pre-incubate the supernatant with gentle shaking at 37°C for 80min. '''This degrades endogenous genetic content (DNA and mRNA).'''
#Dialyze the pre-incubated sample for 45min each at 4°C against 50 volumes of buffer B using a membrane with molecular weight cut-off of 10,000. Repeat the dialysis step three times.
#Centrifuge the retained extract at 4000RCF for 10min at 4°C to obtain the supernatant.
#Divide resulting S30 extract into small aliquots and store at -80°C.

''(Note: Protease inhibitors are added to pre-incubation solution to prevent degradation of proteins required for gene expression.)''

===Notes===
*Total time required: ~ 3 days.
*The protocol is based on [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T3C-4K242VK-1&_user=10&_coverDate=12%2F01%2F2006&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=fbf36c742708c667b5c4481856ca22b5 Simple procedures for the construction of a robust and cost-effective cell-free protein synthesis system] by Kim DM et al.

*We did not prepare any ''E. coli'' S12 extract because of the lack of reagents and limited budget.


==Protocol for Vesicle Formation==

===Day 1===

====Equipment====
*Nitrogen tap + plastic tubing
*Desiccator connected to a vacuum
*100ml glass bottle
*Sonicator with medium-sized probe
*Ice bath
*25°C incubator
*Pipette + pipette tips (1000µl)

====Reagents====
* 10ml dodecane
* 12.5µl 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) 20mg/ml in chloroform, ≥99.0%

====Procedure====

'''Preparing the lipid-oil suspension for the inner leaflet'''
#Place 125µl of the 20mg/ml DOPC solution in a 100ml glass bottle.
#With the plastic tubing and 1ml pipette tip, evaporate the chloroform under nitrogen to obtain a dry, thin lipid film.
#Put the bottle in a desiccator connected to a vacuum for 1h.
#Add 50ml of mineral oil to reach a final lipid concentration of 0.05mg/ml.
#Set the sonicator probe to pulse 1, timer at 30mins.
#Put the bottle containing the suspension in the ice bath.
#Secure the sonicator probe inside the bottle, and set the amplitude to a reading of 10 when it is sonicating.
#Sonicate the suspension for 30mins.
#Leave overnight at 25°C to ensure that the lipid molecules are fully dispersed in oil.

===Day 2===

====Equipment====
*Magnetic stirrer
*Centrifuge + 1-inch glass centrifuge tubes
*Pipette + pipette tips (200µl, 1000µl)
*50ml glass tube
*5ml syringe
*Long 16-gauge stainless steel needle

====Reagents====
*10ml ddH2O
*Tris buffer
*NaCl
*Reporter

====Procedure====

'''Emulsifying the aqueous solution''' (while the interface settles)
#Separate about 5ml of the lipid-oil suspension into a glass container. '''This is for the interface preparation.'''
#Prepare a 10ml solution A with 100mM NaCl and 5 mM Tris buffer at pH 7.4.
#Prepare solution B by adding a suitable quantity of reporter to 1ml of solution A.
#Add 250µl of solution B to the 45ml lipid-oil suspension in mineral oil.
#Gently stir the mixture with a magnetic stir bar for 3h.

'''Preparing the interface''' (to be done while the emulsion is mixing)
#Place 2ml of lipid-oil suspension over 3ml of solution A in a 1-inch-diameter centrifuge tube. 
#Leave for 2–3h for lipids to achieve the coverage of the interface surface.

'''Forming the vesicles'''
#Pour 100µl of the inverted emulsion over the interface.
#Centrifuge at 120g for 10min.

'''Collecting the vesicles'''
#Using a 5ml syringe with a long 16-gauge stainless steel needle, collect some of solution A.
#Expel some of the solution to remove all air from the syringe and needle.
#With the tip of the needle in the aqueous phase, gently expel the solution contained in the syringe.
#Gently recirculate the buffer several times.
#Aspirate most of the solution into the syringe, and remove the needle from the solution.
#Wipe the tip of the needle clean.
#Unload the vesicle suspension into its final container.

''(Note: Use optical microscopy to check that the vesicles obtained arenot deformed or aggregated.)''

===Notes===
*Time Required:
**The lipid-oil suspension preparation takes about 2h (with a 1h waiting period 15min into the procedure), before being left overnight.
*The remainder of the procedure takes another 4h, with one 2h waiting period after an initial 1h preparation.
**Total working time in the lab is around 3 hours.
* The original protocol uses anhydrous 99:1 dodecane:silicone oil solution instead of mineral oil.
*The original protocol uses POPC instead of DOPC phospholipids.
*The original protocol sonicates the suspension in a cleaning sonic bath for 30min.
*Do not use rubber tubing in the nitrogen evaporation. '''This emits debris into the lipids.'''
*This procedure should form around 10^9 vesicles with 1µm diameter.
*Use of salt in the solution A preparation may require osmolarity considerations.
*Use of GFP as a visual signal may require osmolarity considerations.
*The reporter in solution B is optional. '''The vesicles may be visible without it.'''
*The interface should settle for more than 2h, but less than 3h. '''More than 3h causes the lipids to clump.'''
