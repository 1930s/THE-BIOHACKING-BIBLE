Yeast libraries were screened for gold binding alongside yeast known to bind gold (pAu1) and yeast known not to bind gold (pCT-CON).  After 45 min of panning, gold slides were vortexed in sterile water to rip yeast off of the slide. 100 &mu;L of this water was plated and grown.  The slides were then placed in media and yeast still attached were allowed to bud progeny into solution.  This was then plated and grown overnight.  The table describes the efficiency of each method.
