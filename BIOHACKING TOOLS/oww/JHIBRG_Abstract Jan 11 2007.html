===Investigating candidate genes for Alzheimer’s disease with depression=== 

'''Eunchai Kang'''

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive deterioration with declining activities, often exhibits psychiatric symptoms like depression. 
The previous study shows Chr7 q32.3-35 region is associated with Alzheimer’s disease when depression is used as a covariate. To identify the shared genetic susceptibility between AD and depression, I examined this region to find candidate genes. Among 85 genes in this region, 3 genes (CHRM2, CASP2, GSTK1) were selected based on association to AD, depression or biological relevance found in previous studies. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping screen of this 3 genes (35 SNPs) were performed, and the SNPs that can represent linkage disequilibrium block were chosen.  
For statististical Analysis, family based association test was done by using FBAT software.
