==OUR FIRST Biobricks !!==
*F-OriT-J23066-OriT pSB1A2 now named as I741051!
*waiting for sequencing to get the final detail.

==re-do: PlacI -> I741051==
*basic experiment condition :[[IGEM:Peking/2007/Count-Conjugation-Notebook/2007-8-10]]
*we changed "fast T4 ligase" ligation time : from 20min ->10 min @16℃
*digesting for longer time.
*use both "fast T4 ligase" & normal T4 ligase".

=oriT Knock Out=
*By Xu Anting
==Transformation of pKO3-oriT-deleted plasmid into DH5a==
*Result: negative controls have an approximately number of clones in comparing with ligation products.  It seems that our DH5a have been contaminated.

==Ligation Products Verification==
*By Colony PCR
*Picked colonies and grew them in an additional Cm Petri-dish, in 37 centrigrade, overnight.


=Lock & Key By Yu Tao=
==Transformatiion Test of the Newly Prepared Competent Cells (Competent Cells I)==
===Transformation Result===
*Number of colonies: 
#Previous competent cells: more than 2000 clones.
#Newly prepared competent cells: fewer than 1000 clones.
*Comments: I think the efficiency of the new cells is a little bit lower and I decide to make some more competent cells tomorrow.

==J01010 and J01008 (both by PCR) Digestion Product Purification==
*Both of the fragments are digested from yesterday.
*use Transgen EasyPure PCR Purification Kit / Quick Gel Extraction Kit.
*50uL per tube after purflication, one tube, respectively.
===Electrophorsis Result===
*from ''left'' to ''right'':
#J01010 @ XbaI/PstI (2uL)
#J01008 @ XbaI/PstI (2uL)
#DL plus 2000 marker
#J01010 PCR product (2uL)
#J01010 PCR product (2uL)
#J01008 PCR product (2uL)
#DL plus 2000 marker
#marker

==Ligation: R0010<-J01008 and R0040<-J01010==
*Ligate the J01008 fragment and R0010 vector, also the J01010 fragment and R0040 vector.
*I use the previous digested R0040 @ PstI/SpeI and R0010 @ PstI/SpeI.
===Electrophorsis Result===
*from ''left'' to ''right'':
#R0040 @ PstI/SpeI (Use PCR purification kit)
#R0010 @ PstI/SpeI (Use PCR purification kit)
#DL plus 2000 marker
#marker
[[Image:Example.jpg]]

*Comments: The R0040 @ PstI/SpeI seems degraded
*Ligation system contains:

<pre>
8 µl       J01008 fragment / 6.5 µl       J01010 fragment
0.5 µl     R0010 vector / 2 µl     R0040 vector
0.5 µl     Super T4-Ligase
1 µl       10 X ligation buffer
--------------------------
10 µl      Total
</pre>

*The negative control group contains no fragment but the same volume ddH2O instead.
*10min at 16℃  

==Transformation: the new ligation product above==
*Transform each 10 µl ligation system into 100 µl DH5α competent cells.
*Culture R0010<-J01010 cells at Amp+ and R0040<-J01008 LB plate for 12 hours.
*Result to be seen tomorrow.
