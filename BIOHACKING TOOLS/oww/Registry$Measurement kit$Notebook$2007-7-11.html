*Running gel of yesterday's gradient PCR:

<order?>
*Getting strange secondary product on E0240 BB pcr. Should re-try with vent polymerase.
*Did so (but ran out of template dna in the process):

==Sequencing results==
*Newly constructed I2055 doesn't have promoter in it
*E0240-1AK3 looks scarred from reverse. Forward sequence is too short; trying again with primers internal to GFP.
*T9002-3K3 just matched 3K3



==Ligation==
Growth on:
*I2057-3K3
*T9002-3K3 and 1AK3
*E0240-3K3
Failed:
*I2057-1AK3 (strange growth)
*I2056-1AC3, 1AT3 (none)
*Re-plating these

==Colony PCR==

*Row 1: I2057-3K3 (4-1) [1], I2057-1AK3(1-4) E0240-3K3(1-4) [1]
*Row 2: T9002-3K3 (4-1) [3], T9002-1AK3 [3]
*brackets indicate colony chosen for sequencing

*3K3 may be working, but mis-priming in the PCR. Will check with internal GFP primers.
