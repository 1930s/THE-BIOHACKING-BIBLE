==Agenda==
#Check sequencing results of constitutive promoters + CPX
#Dilute last night's LCs (F2620.B0034.CPX.B0014)
#Miniprep half of last night's LCs and send in for sequencing
#Live cell fluorescence immunoassay (or western blot) with f2620.b0034.cpx.b0014 transformed cells in M9 media


==SUMMARY==
#Ran polystyrene wash assays on various concentrations and wash compositions of CPX-inserted cells
#Concluded that overexpression of CPX in more than 10e-5 M AHL is toxic to cell, and most efficient induction happens between 10e-6 and 10e-7 M AHL
#Grew up individual parts on Mer-GFP system
#Currently working on sending Biobrick I13500 to sequencing


==FUTURE PLANS==
#Run gel digestion and purify I13500
#Run PCR and purify MerR/MerPT
#Either do two standard assemblies or one 3A assembly on a TK Precut Plasmid
#Send in for sequencing and do mercury assay test
