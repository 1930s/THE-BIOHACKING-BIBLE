==Primer reconstitution==
When the primers arrive, redissolve them in 50 mM Tris buffer to yield a concentration of ~800 ng/&mu;l.  See this page on [[Reconstituting primers | reconstituting primers]] for more information.  Consider doing a [[PNK Treatment of DNA Ends|PNK step]] on the primers if they do not have 5' phosphates and you intend to use them for ligation.

==Annealing Mix==
This reaction mix and multiples thereof are known to work but they have not been extensively optimized so improvements likely exist.
*8 &mu;L of each of the concentrated primers
*4 &mu;L of salt solution (10 mM NaCl)
*20 &mu;L of water

==Option 1==
Anneal the primers by heating them at least 5&deg;C above their melting point and cooling them down slowly in stages using a [[Endy:Thermocyclers|Thermocycler]].  Melting temperature calculations can best be done using software such as [[VectorNTI]] or data may come with the primers themselves.

==Option 2==
A simpler approach is to add the above mix in a PCR tube to a beaker of boiling water and just allow the water to cool down naturally.  Most primer pairs with length less than 100bp should be fully melted at 100<sup>o</sup>C and certainly any non-specific binding should be melted at that temperature.
