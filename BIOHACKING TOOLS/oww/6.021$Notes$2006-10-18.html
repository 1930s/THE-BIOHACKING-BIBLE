==Electrical properties of cells==
* Information processing
** code sensory inputs
** generate outputs
** computation
*Graded potential vs action potential
** Graded: change in input leads to change in output
***Doesn't have to be linear, just incremental
*** Many inputs cause graded change in potential
*** All cells do graded potentials
** Action potential
*** Incremental change leads to different response
*** Neurons/electrical cells
* Properties of action potentials
** All-or-none
** threshold
** refractory
*** absolute refractory period: essentially impossible to generate action potential
*** relative refractory period: requires stronger stimulus (higher threshold)
*** also a period where threshold is lower (more easily excitable)
** Strength/duration
** Accomodation
*** with slow enough change, doesn't cause action potential even after it goes above threshold
** Anode break
*** can trigger action potential by lowering potential for awhile then raising to rest potential
** decrement-free
*** can't think of neurons as a wire which degrades a signal
*** neurons have decrement-free conduction
