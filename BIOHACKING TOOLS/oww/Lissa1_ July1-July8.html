==Weekend==
#Wash and image Western on Saturday morning

==July 3, 2006==
#Start SUMO gel with ATP analog/arrested yeast from Friday. - DONE
##SO FEW YEAST - is something wrong?  What protocol to use?  Same one?
#Who is "the boy who lived" on my pGEV transformation?
#Work on biobricking PPL parts (now that I have Endy Lab membership) 
#What if the pGEV we have is on a CEN/ARS plasmid with a Trp marker, like the paper says?  Is this even a remote possibility?
#Come up with schedule for rest of week...  July 4 vacation day? - DONE
# Colony PCR of "the boy who lived" - DONE
#Transform new pGEV in to E. coli - DONE

==July 4, 2006==
#Day off?  Institute holiday...

==July 5, 2006 ==
#Native extraction! using unarrested 403 - DONE
#Pour new sumo gel for native extraction samples - DONE
#Transfer and overnight incubation of Western from July 3 - DONE
#Run a gel of the colony PCR from Monday - DONE
##If it works, and pGEV is there, grow up overnight culture from new plate
##If it works, and pGEV isn't there...
##If it doesn't work, try again (see July 6).
##Conclusion:  something is happening, but it isn't either bad nor good.  Mixed bag.  Try again.
#Order anti-Fus3 antibody from Santa Cruz, order Rainbow Marker from GE Healthcare. - DONE
#Set up overnight culture of pGEV E. coli in LB+Amp. - Had to plate anew (1:200) instead, but that is DONE
#Set up overnight of 403-1030-1018 in SCD -u -h.  -DONE

==July 6, 2006==
#Wash and image Western - DONE
#Try colony PCR again (AM) and run gel - DONE
#Grow up overnight culture of pGEV404 in DH5alpha in LB+Amp. -DONE
#Grow up overnight culture of 403-1030-1018 in SCR -u -h. - DONE
#Set up freezer stock (the kind in glycerol) of 403-1030-1018 from yesterday's overnight. -DONE
#Debug peristaltics - DONE

==July 7, 2006==
#Miniprep pGEV out of E. coli, do characteristic digest (run gel), linearize pGEV with SnaBI (run gel). -DONE 
#Transfer and overnight incubation of Western - set up transfer
#If sumo gel with noc-arrested samples didn't work, re-arreast cells. - DONE, even though it worked
#If there's time, do a PCR of the yeast genome with Trp1_A and Trp1_D.- MOVED TO MONDAY
#Transform pGEV in to 1030-1018 using green star EZ method - DONE

==July 8, 2006==
#Set up overnight incubation of Western - DONE

==July 9, 2006==
#Imaging of Western -DONE
#Pour new 12% SUMO gel - DONE
#Prep arrested cells from Friday and load on gel - DONE
