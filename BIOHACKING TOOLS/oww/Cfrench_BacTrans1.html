==Transformation of ''Bacillus subtilis''==
This protocol was developed by Lucy Montgomery based on published protocols (Anagnostopoulos and SPizizen, 1961, J. Bacteriol. '''81:'''741 and Young and Spizizen, 1961, J. Bacteriol. '''81:'''823). It has been used successfully with pVK168 (specR) and pTG262 (cmlR).

===Materials needed===
*Plate of ''B. subtilis'' 168
*20% glucose
*1.0 M MgSO4.7H2O
*0.1 M CaCl2
*0.05 M MnSO4
*20% w/v casamino acids
*11 mg/ml indole (dissolve in dimethyl sulfoxide)

===5 x Spizizen's Salts===
*available from the media prep room; if you need to make this for yourself, it contains:
*1% w/v ammonium sulphate
*7% w/v K2HPO4
*3% w/v KH2PO4
*0.5% w/v Na3citrate dihydrate
*0.1% w/v magnesium sulphate)

===Solution P===
*25 ml 1 M MgSO4
*5 ml 0.1 M CaCl2
*0.1 ml 0.05 M MnSO4
*70 ml water

===Pre-Transformation Medium (PTM)===
*2 ml 5 x Spizizen's Salts
*8 ml water (sterile)
*0.5 ml 20% glucose
*0.1 ml solution P
*0.2 ml 20% casamino acids
*0.01 ml indole (11 mg/ml)(''B. subtilis'' 168 is auxotrophic for tryptophan and requires indole or tryptophan to be provided).

===Transformation Medium (TM)===
*2 ml 5 x Spizizen's Salts
*8 ml water (sterile)
*0.3 ml 20% glucose
*5 microlitres 20% Casamino Acids
*10 microlitres indole (11 mg/ml)

===Procedure===
*Grow an overnight culture of ''B. subtilis'' 168 in L-broth.
*Check the OD at 600 nm. The one time I tried this, it was 1.13, which seems lower than I expected.
*Prepare 10 ml PTM and place 5 ml in each of 2 vials (we use 40 ml glass universals).
*Inoculate each vial with overnight culture, one more heavily than the other. I used 0.5 ml and 1.0 ml. Lucy's protocol calls for final OD about 0.25 and 0.75 but mine were obviously considerably lower.
*Grow the cultures at 37 C with shaking until they get reasonably turbid. Lucy's protocol calls for an OD of 3, but my cultures did not reach this. After 5 hours they were at 2.12 and 1.79, at which point I got bored and used them anyway.
*As an alternative to monitoring OD, check motility by wet mount. I am informed that when ''B. subtilis'' is motile, it is competent. I checked my cultures at the time/OD noted above and both were vigorously motile.
*Prepare PTM and dispense 1 ml to each of however many vials you want to transform, not neglecting a negative control with no DNA.
*Add 0.1 ml culture to each vial, and 5 microlitres (about 0.5 micrograms or so) of plasmid DNA.
*Incubate with shaking at 37ËšC for 30 to 90 minutes.
*Plate onto selective plates. Spectinomycin at 100 mg/l is used for pVK168, chloramphenicol at 10 mg/l for pTG262 and derivatives thereof.
*For pTG262 I obtained numerous chloramphenicol-resistant colonies after one night incubation. Constructs based on pVK168 and plated on spec100 seem to require longer to grow.
