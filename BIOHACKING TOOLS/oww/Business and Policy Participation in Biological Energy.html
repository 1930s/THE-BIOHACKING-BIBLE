* What are the existing government regulations that might give bioenergy technologies a market advantage (e.g. tax breaks for reductions in carbon emissions)?
* What are the stepping stone technologies to get to direct conversion of light energy and water to hydrogen gas (so called direct photobiolysis)?
* What current technologies are mature enough to be an actual competing product (venture capital fundable)?
