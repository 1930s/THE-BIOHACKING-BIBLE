== Research ==
'''I am interested in two broad questions in biology:'''<br>
<br>
'''1. How do proteins come together to form a functional molecular machine, capable of the complex task of DNA transport through a membrane (e.g. in bacterial mating)?<br>'''
<br>
'''2. How are the proteins that make up a complex molecular machine targeted to the correct location in the bacterial cell in order for them to function properly.'''

Bacterial mating or conjugation is the transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another via direct cell-to-cell contact through a mating pore. My current research uses the genetically-tractable bacterium ''Bacillus subtilis'' as a model system to explore the function and subcellular localization of a putative component of the bacterial mating pore apparatus. I have been characterizing the protein YddE which is encoded on the ''B. subtilis'' conjugal element ICE''Bs1''. YddE is related to proteins encoded on conjugal elements in numerous bacteria, including the Gram-positive pathogens ''S. aureus, C. difficile'', and ''L. monocytogenes''. YddE belongs to a large superfamily of ATP-dependent pumps involved in the extrusion of proteins and DNA through membrane pores. I have shown that YddE and its ATPase domain are essential for mating of  ICE''Bs1''. In addition, YddE localizes at the cell poles, in close association with the membrane (see Figure). Given YddE’s localization, ATPase domain, and essentiality in conjugation, I propose that YddE and its homologs are the essential membrane-associated ATPase component of the Gram-positive mating pore apparatus. I plan on analyzing the role of YddE in conjugation, exploring its functional domains, and investigating its subcellular localization through a combination of bioinformatics, molecular, cellular, and biochemical techniques.

== Personal ==
My husband, Mehmet Berkmen, is also a microbiologist. He was a postdoctoral fellow in [http://beck2.med.harvard.edu/  Jon Beckwith's lab] at Harvard Medical School.<br>

Now he is at the biotechnology company [http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/default.asp New England Biolabs], where he is developing ''Escherichia coli'' strains and plasmids for recombinant protein production.<br>
<br>
In my free time, I like to cook, play with my son Kaan, practice my Turkish, and travel.
