*Plates with transformation of ligation product seem to be overgrown.
*[[Streak_plates|Streaking them out]] on new Tet plates to get single colonies.

*Actually, the problem is most likely that the tetracycline plates didn't work.

*Poured new Tet and Chloramphenicol plates
*Tet: (1 in 1000): added 500µL to 500mL
*Chlor: (1 in 250): added 2.5 mL to 500mL

*Transferring colonies from old plates to new ones using Jason's makeshift protocol:
#Add 1 mL of LB to the plate
#Get the LB to cover all of the colonies
#Pipet, or if you're feeling brave, pour the LB into a tube
#Plate 50~100µL onto the new plate

*Placed excess of transfer LB in the -4 fridge.
