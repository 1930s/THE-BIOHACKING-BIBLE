|general= I am interested in studying of chemotactic responses in invasive cancer cells through cell tracking and computational imaging. Before coming to [[MIT]], I did quantitative cellular biology and modeling of signaling pathway, was studying [http://biology.caltech.edu biology] and [http://eas.caltech.edu engineering & applied science] (emphasizing computation & neural systems), and modeling nucleosome unwrapping. Other than doing stuff in the lab, I like competitive ballroom dancing, rock camping, backcountry camping and kayaking esp. when outside is not too cold. If you're curious, I have [http://web.mit.edu/~rimchala/www my page at MIT] that's not too frequently updated.
