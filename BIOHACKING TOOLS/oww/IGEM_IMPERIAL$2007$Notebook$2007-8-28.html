==In vitro Testing of pTet-LuxR-pLux-GFP at room temperature==
Testing of the construct was done at a low concentration of AHL 0.1nM to emulate a real biofilm. This experiment tests whether the system is sensitive enough to respond to the low amounts of AHL. 
<br><br>
Protocol can be found here under [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Experimental_Design/Phase1/Protocol_2.2|Phase 1-In vitro testing]] on the experimental design page.
<br><br>
Results: Very low levels of fluorescence was observed.

==Construction of pT7-GFP==

#Grew cells with plasmids containing pT7-GFP and cells with vector plasmids overnight
#Spun down cells and minipreped

Protocols can be found at [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Notebook/General_Protocols#Miniprep|Miniprep]] in the general protocols page
