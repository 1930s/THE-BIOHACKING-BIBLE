Samantha is the current president of SfGS, which really just means that she stands back as all the other members get their groove on with various events. Samantha is a graduate student in the Endy Lab studying Synthetic Biology. Hopefully someday she will be able to engineer microbes to solve all of the world's problems... until then, we've got a lot of work to do at SfGS!
