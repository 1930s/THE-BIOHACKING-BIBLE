==IAA Smell Test==
Added .1, .5, 1, 5, 10ul to 5ml liquid cultures of Top10
.5ul was detectable, but .1ul (which we might get) was less detectable

*Tested today in preferred IK strains = '''Good News'''
**.1 &mu;L IAA and .5 &mu;L IAA smelled strongly and pleasantly of bananas in IK strains. It is reasonable to estimate that our ATF1 gene can generate in E. coli about this range of IAA
**IK gave a huge improvement over the Top10 smell cultures

==Indole Knockouts==
Out of 3 strains, the JC12337 did not smell as nice
*note, previous disappointment with IK stemmed from contaminated LB
Made glycerols of MB408 and MEB61

==osmY-Trunc Eco/Spe Digest==

*5 uL Buffer 2
*0.5 uL BSA
*2 uL ~800 ng/uL Annealed osmY-Trunc primers
*1.25 uL EcoRI
*1.25 uL SpeI

==ATF1A*, R0030, R0032 Digests==
#Cut ATF1A* with EcoRI and XbaI ---- 38 ng/&mu;L
#Cut R0030 with EcoRI and SpeI ---- 10 ng/&mu;L
#Cut R0032 with EcoRI and SpeI ---- 23 ng/&mu;L
