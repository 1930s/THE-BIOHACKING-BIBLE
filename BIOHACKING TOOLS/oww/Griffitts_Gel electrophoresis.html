==Materials==
* Gel tray
* 1X [[Griffitts:Common_buffers#50X_TAE_.281_L.29|TAE buffer]]
* 16-well comb
* autoclave tape
* agarose (for standard DNA gels)
* 1 mg/mL [[Griffitts:Common_buffers#ethidium_bromide_.2810_mL.29|ethidium bromide]]
* [[Griffitts:Common_buffers#8X_DNA_loading|8X loading dye]]
* [[Griffitts:Common_buffers#DNA_ladder|DNA ladder]]
==Procedure==
===Gel preparation===
* Carefully tape both ends of the tray with autoclave tape
* Insert the 16-well comb
* Start with 50 mL 1X [[Griffitts:Common_buffers#50X_TAE_.281_L.29|TAE buffer]]
** Use the flask labeled "Agarose--keep in gel area"
* Add 0.5 g agarose
** Use the agarose labeled "for standard DNA gels"
* Microwave until dissolved
** This will take less than 1 minute and will require frequent stirring to prevent a boil-over
* Add 8 μL of 1 mg/mL [[Griffitts:Common_buffers#ethidium_bromide_.2810_mL.29|ethidium bromide]] and stir
** This is kept in the fridge
* Allow to cool ~5 minutes
* Pour into the tray and allow agarose to solidify
* Remove tape and comb
** Remove the comb slowly so you don't tear the wells

===Sample preparation===
* Cut a section of Parafilm
* Add 2 μL [[Griffitts:Common_buffers#8X_DNA_loading|8X loading dye]] to the parafilm
* Combine 2 μL of your sample to the [[Griffitts:Common_buffers#8X_DNA_loading|8X loading dye]]
* Repeat this for each sample
===Electrophoresis===
* Check to make sure there is enough 1X [[Griffitts:Common_buffers#50X_TAE_.281_L.29|TAE buffer]] in the gel box
** Dr. Griffitts has drawn a black line on the side indicating where is sufficient
** If you suspect the 1X [[Griffitts:Common_buffers#50X_TAE_.281_L.29|TAE buffer]] is old, replace it; you may dump the old 1X [[Griffitts:Common_buffers#50X_TAE_.281_L.29|TAE buffer]] down the drain with water
* Place your gel (still on the tray) in the box with the wells away from you
** If your gel is pointing the wrong way, you will run your samples into the buffer
* To the first lane at 5 μL of 1 kb [[Griffitts:Common_buffers#DNA_ladder|DNA ladder]]
* Add 4 μL of each of your samples (2 μL sample + 2 μL [[Griffitts:Common_buffers#8X_DNA_loading|8X loading dye]]) to each of the subsequent wells
* Place the lid on the gel box
** Make sure the black cable is away from you and the red cable is near you
** If you reverse the cables you will run your samples into the buffer
* Turn on the gel box
* Adjust voltage to 120 V
* Wait until you can see that the [[Griffitts:Common_buffers#8X_DNA_loading|8X loading dye]] has moved 1-2 inches down the gel
** If you can't see your loading dye, you've probably run your samples into the buffer
