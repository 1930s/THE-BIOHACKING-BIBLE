==Agenda==
#Transform tk's competent cells with yesterday's 3A assembly results (F2620+B0034 and CPX insert into vector pSB1AC3)
#Make LB+Cm and LB+Cm+Kan plates
#Liquid cultures of eight tubes made and put in warm room -- for making glycerol stocks
##2 tubes of DB3.1 (Kan+)
##2 tubes of transformed E1010 from resistance test plate (Kan+)
##2 tubes of transformed F2620 from resistance test plate (Amp+)
##2 tubes of transformed B0034 from resistance test plate (Amp+)
##All should be taken out tomorrow morning and used to make glycerol stocks
#Meeting with TK and Drew

===Results from Transformations===
*BBa_I13500 (B0034+GFP), 200 µl: 50 colonies
*BBa_I13500, 100 µl: 10 colonies
*PICSS8, 200 µl, #2: 5 colonies
*PICSS8, 100 µl, #2: 1 colony
*pHIE6, 100 µl, #2: 25 colonies
*pHIE6, 200 µl, #2: 45 colonies
*CPX, 50 µl: lawn (as expected)
*CPX, 100 µl: lawn (as expected)
*CPX, 200 µl: lawn (as expected)

===Transformed tk's competent cells===
*Aliquoted one of the original vials into eight eppendorfs, 100µL each.
*Did 3 sets of transformations:
**2 of yesterday's 3A assembly product (plasmid contains: F2620+B0034+CPX in pSB1AC3 backbone)
**1 negative control (pSB1AC3 digested with EcoRI and PstI)
*Followed our Transformation protocol (tk's modified protocol)

*Transformations were put into 37C room at 11:30 AM and incubated for 2 hrs

===Poured Plates, again===
*Used stringent working concentrations:
**10µg of Kanamycin per mL of LB
**25µg of Chloramphenicol per mL of LB
**Poured 5 LB+Cm+Kan plates
**Poured 29 LB+Cm plates
*Cm plates have green labels
*Used stringent/relaxed concentrations for other plates:
**25 plates with 30µg/mL of Kan
**20 plates with 35µg/mL of Amp 


==Meeting Notes==

*Run a sensitivity easy experiment

*HgCl2 MSDS 
**Ask tom for HgCl2, or even chemical room


*Reshman has the DNA for Leucine zipper
**CPX to display ?

*''''Transcriptional Terminator''''

*B0010 and B0012
**B0015 is the double terminator and works very well.


*Get T7 antibody, order
**Think of getting fluorescent version of the body, secondary version that is fluorescent
**Endy lab or Brian's lab.  Has origin antibody.

*Could use FLAG tag in FhuA, or HA tag, needs to work internally; CMiC


*Get EC20 display, and CCG?
**LPP-OMP-A


*First Lorenzo, fused a single chain antibody.  Antibody, can get complement;


*Make Cell maps
**Input then output.  

 	
*Cysteines: will not export proteins that have internal cysteine bonds.  Periplasm is where they farm.  No export through that system.


*Washing:
**Negative control
**EBS, salt conditions


*Absorption on Spec
**1 OD of cells
**Take 2 mL
