From the gel with the different controls, we can conclude that either the Vent polymerase or the buffer is contaminated. Also, we think that the biobricks primers are contaminated - we will diagnose this further in the next PCR reaction.

==Weekly meeting==
Once again we received plenty of good feedback from our weekly meeting.
*There was a strong sentiment that we should synthesize just the KaiABC genes, instead of synethesizing complete operons including KaiABC and the promoters we want.
**+ We can order the syntheses sooner, without having to decide on promoters
**+ There's a strong chance we'll want to experiment with different promoters, so our synthesized constructs should be modular
***- However, we could still design our operons to have digestible promoters\
**+ We would have BioBrick parts for the registry

==Agenda for the next few days==
We organized a nice little flowchart going over what we want to do today and tomorrow:
[[Image:Agenda_Flowchart_7-17.png |none|thumb|500px| Agenda for 7/17 - 7/18]]

We determined that the Vent or Vent buffer was contaminated with our template, which caused the streaks in our controls.  We decided to do another transformation using the second gel-extracted DNA (also from reaction #21 on Monday), which we will then miniprep and PCR with Hotstar and possibly new Vent and/or KOD polymerase.

==Incubation==
We incubated 6 colonies from Hetmann's plates in order to increase our chances of getting our 3kb Kai insert.  After a lengthy diagnosis, we determined that the 3kb segment we have been working with may not be KaiABC, so this will help us cover our bases.

==Transformation==
We transformed OneShot Top10 compentent cells with our KaiABC construct from the second gel purification. This is in preparation of another miniprep and PCR with Hotstar/Vent/KOD.

We used 40 µL, 10 µL, and 10 µL of competent cells for the experimental, positive control, and negative control transformations.

==Western Blotting Protocol== 
Found some resources on Western Blots, which can be found [[IGEM:Harvard/2006/Cyanobacteria/Literature#Western Blotting Protocols | here]].

==Synthesis==
===Debate===
  Q: What is the best way to synthesize? With terminator and promoters or without?

Prof. Silver and other faculty believe that synthesis of ORF's is best; while Prof. Church had the idea that they could be made easily swappable out if we could put in BB ends. Still under investigation.

===Companies===

In order of our interest:


'''Geneart'''<br>
WT genes, $1.10/bp if it is not difficult, but if it is difficult it goes to $2.90/bp. 15 days rush delivery included of the 1.6kb construct. Ela is the contact. Sent coding regions for analysis, see peng for email contact.
   Cost: $3080 for 15 days guaranteed.

'''Coda'''<br>
Guaranteeing expression of proteins in e. coli, manipulate codon usage --- guarantees protein expression: $1/bp; pcr, clone; turnaround 7-10days. (will guarantee expression). BUT the catch is that it takes 1 wk to assemble short fragments, 2.5 weeks to assemble long fragments. Dr. Joseph Kiddel is the contact at ext. 1006. For rush assembly of the 1.6kb fragment, it is $3/bp.
   Cost: If rush 1.6kb and slow others, $4680+$1200. Otherwise slow is $2800.

'''Dna 2.0'''<br>
$1.50 bp, minimal $500/gene. Turnaround time 1.5kb -> 10-12 business days, guarantee to ship in 20, offer to ship quicker.  Clonal in e. coli plasmid. No guarantee of the actual expression. $4/bp for 2-day less than 1kb.
   Cost: $4200 for 20 days max, 10-12 avg. Called again, will not drop time guarantee.

'''Codon devices'''
4-6 weeks. Pluck 19 vector . Expedited 15day, ADD .30/bp. THEN $1.19/bp ==> $1.49. 
   Cost: $4172 for 15 days

'''Blue Heron'''
   Won't work
