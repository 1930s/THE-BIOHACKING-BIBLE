==Overview==

This protocol describes the procedure for grafting PEG-acrylate to Zeonor slides.

==Materials==

*PEG acrylate
*Ethylene Glycol
*2-Dimethoxy-2-acetophenone (DMPAP)

==Procedure==
#Weigh out 35 mg DMPAP
#Clean plastic slide with EtOH, then rinse with Millipore water
#Plasma treat surface of plastic slide
#Mixed DMPAP with 800<math>u</math>L Ethylene Glycol and 1200<math>u</math>L PEG-acrylate in 2mL tube
#Heat solution in hot water bath at 85&degC until DMPAP crystals have melted
#Vortex solution
#Add solution in uniform layer plastic slide
#Photograft slide in UV Crosslinker for 30 seconds on maximum energy
#Rinse with MeOH and let dry under hood
#remove excess poly-PEG acrylate
