How Does Human Ventral Temporal Cortex Contribute to Object Perception

Human Background data:
Selective BOLD responses to faces or objects in FFA. PPA, LOC
Lesions in bilateral ventral temporal cortex have been associated with agnosia for objects

Monkey Background data:
Numerous studies of IT show selective responses to higher order objects
Affraz showed that indirect activation of IT alters perception of objects.

Preliminary data:
Using fMRI, we can map retinotopic cortex and LOC/VTC in patients
LFPs are a good measure of neuronal activity--e.g. can record small RFs in V1
Object selective responses exist in VTC
VTC responses are moderately tolerant of changes in stim size and position
Stimulation of object selective VTC does not result in perceptual event (except in rare instances)


Competitive Advantages:
#1: HUMAN subjects
#2: Combine fMRI, recording and stimulation in the same brain
#3: Stimulation advantage: use stimulation to prove necessity
#4: Electrical recording advantages (vs. fMRI):Temporal measures are valuable
vs. EEG/MRG: precise spatial localization

Aims:

1. Nature of Visual Responses in VTC
a) object selectivity in small groups of neurons in human VTC measured with LFP and fMRI
Hypothesis: areas that prefer a specific stimulus category in fMRI should also prefer that category with LFPs
Selectivity should be more narrowly tuned with LFPs

b) Spatial receptive fields for VTC
Hypothesis: RFs should be large and contralateral in VTC; may be hot spots

2. Does stimulation of VTC object selective areas recordings evoke a visual percept?
Hypothesis: Except in rare cases, will NOT be percepts because objects are represented in a sparse, distributed way.

3. Does stimulation of an object selective area of VTC result in a change in the perception of an object? 
Hypothesis: Yes, stimulation of areas that prefer a stimulus will ONLY affect perception of that stimulus not others.


(Aim 2 is relevant bc may need to be sure that stim is eccentric to see effect of unilateral stimulation).

Protocol
fMRI: find category-object areas

LFP: map selectivity, find pref stimuli

Stim: Stimulate and see if we can bias perception

This lets us address the nature of object representation in human ventral temporal cortex.
We can assess the necessity of a given area for perception of the preferred or non-preferred stimulus by disrupting or artificially activating it.


Goals for the future:
Need to use smaller and more closely spaced electrodes, may exceed our methods

Collectively, these experiments will capitalize on a unique opportunity to obtain high-quality neurophysiological recordings directly from the human brain to provide new insights about the representation of objects in visual cerebral cortex and how those representations relate to behavioral performance.
