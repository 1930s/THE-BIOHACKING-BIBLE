==Objective:  Microbial synthesis of natural and unnatural organic compounds==

This testbed is broken into two parts:

#Microbial synthesis of terpene indole alkaloids (TIAs), plant natural products
#''de novo'' design of biosynthetic pathways

==Parts==
* malic acid to malic semialdehyde converting enzyme

* 7-deoxyloganin synthetic enzymes (from glucose + GPP)

* vinblastine/vincristine transporter

==Devices==
====Precursor Amplifiers====
* Over-expression of rate-limiting enzyme(s) for precursor formation

* Simple expression device (promoter, RBS, ORF (protein coding), terminator)

* Amp needs:  tryptophan, geranyl diphoshpate (GPP), malic acid

====Multi-cistronic/Multi-genic Biosynthetic Devices====
* Multiple ORFs with individual promoter/terminator pairs or as multi-cistronic operons

====Metabolite Sensors====
Needed to rapidly evaluate success in achieving synthesis goals.

* secologanin
* strictosidine
* 3,4-dihydroxbutyric acid

====Metabolite-controlled Biosynthetic Devices====
* Includes parts in multi-cistronic/multi-genic device

* Metabolite-responsive expression (transcriptional control -- same switches can be used in sensors and control devices)
** secolaganin
** strictosidine
** 3,4-dihydroxybutyric acid

====Extracellular/Surface-associated Biosynthetic Device====
* Surface-anchoring protein part
* promoter, RBS, ORF, terminator

==Chassis==
* Precursor supply
** tryptophan
** geranyl diphosphate (GPP)
** malic acid

* Free glucose (PTS-independent) transport
