==About Me==

I am a sixth-year graduate student in [http://www.biology.duke.edu/willislab/ John Willis'] lab.  I work primarily on the genetics of floral pigment patterning in a group of mokeyflowers (''Mimulus'') from the foothills of the Chilean Andes.  I grew up in [[:Image:proxy falls.jpg|Oregon]], and may one day move back in a more westerly direction, but for now the [http://we-love-durham.com/locopops.php Locopops] are keeping me here.

==My Research==
[[Image:arielle_fig1.jpg|300px|left|Fig. 1: M. l. luteus, M. l. variegatus, M. naiandinus, orange M. cupreus, and yellow M. cupreus]]

''Mimulus luteus var. luteus'', ''M. l. variegatus'', ''M. naiandinus'' and ''M. cupreus'' are four closely related members of the genus ''Mimulus'' that differ dramatically in the distribution of a red anthocyanin pigment, cyanidin, in their floral tissues (Fig. 1).  This pattern variation is phylogenetically unique: the study taxa belong to a large monophyletic group in which virtually all of the other ~40 species have remarkably constant corolla pigmentation (yellow with red spots along the throat).  My thesis has focused on the following questions:


#Is there evidence of pollinator-mediated reproductive isolation among floral types?
#Are pigment patterning differences, both within and between species, simple or quantitative?
#What is the identity of the pigment patterning genes?
#*Are the functional changes structural or regulatory?
#*Is there evidence of convergent evolution (are distinct genetic mechanisms responsible for similar phenotypes)?
