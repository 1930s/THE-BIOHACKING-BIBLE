= Trudy MacKay (NC State): The genetic architecture of complex traits -- lessons from Drosophila =

== Vocabulary ==
* Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL)
* linkage disequilibrium
* association mapping
* pleiotropy

== Background ==
* master at Dalhausie
* PhD Edinbrugh
* Oliver Max Gardener Award
* Fellow Royal Soc
* American Acad Arts and Sciences
* Gender and Env can infect gene expression

== Talk ==
* across animals and plant populations - huge variation in morphology, behavior, etc.
* phenotype exhibits approx normal distribution among pops
** many interacting genes
** individual small effects
** expression of alleles sensitive to env.
*** central limit theorem

=== Questions ===
* What are the genes affecting variation of complex traits?
* What is distribution of allelic effects?
* Effects of multiple traits (pleiotropy) ?
* Interactions between genes (epistasis) ?
* Environmental sensitivities (GEI) ?
* Molecular basis of allelic variation (QTN) ?

=== Drosophila Genetic Resources ===
* clonable
* reared in large #'s
* complete sequence
* range of complex traits
** number of sensitive bristles
** resis. to env. stresses
* model organisms
** gen properties of arch of complex traits - transferrable across range of organisms

=== Approaches to Understanding Complex Traits in Flys ===
* Unbiased forward mutagenesis screen
** induce p-transposable element movement with crosses to cause mutagenesis
* what p-insert lines are different from non-insert control
* everything in same background - build own genetic networks
** all crosses of double heterozygotes?
** whole genome transcripts useful as well
** QTL mapping - take 2 gen diff strains, cross (recomb populations - back crosses, F2, recomb genome lines)
*** take genotype, and phenotype - statistical analysis to map chromosomal region (quantitative trait loci) to find
region of chromosome responsible for phenotype - have a statistical significance threshold
**** problem - size of QTLs is large because of sample size
**** with flies, use deficiency strains (bits of chromosome missing) - take deficiency chromosomes that overlap QTL, and do crosses,
can find where QTL allelic variant exists
** Association mapping - linkage disequilibrium: correlation in gene freq at 2 or more polymorphic loci
*** linkage equil - equal frac of gamete frequencies (disequil if differs from this)
*** disequil might happen because of mutation of gene affecting complex trait - orig entire genome is in disequil,
but over time recomb happens and disequil decoys
*** essentially do QTL at the level of a gene
*** flies - make designer genotypes

=== Inferences Made in Recent Years ===
* results of applying techniques above
* screen for traits
** abdominal bristle number
** sternopleural bristle number
** life span
** locomation
** mating 
** aggressive behavior
* genes affect multiple traits
