==Overview==
There are no absolute rules for naming new parts for submission into the [http://parts.mit.edu/ Registry of Standard Biological Parts].  However, there are a few conventions that will make it easier for others to find and use your parts.

==BBa_Xnnnn==

===BB===
In the name of a BioBrick, the '''BB''' represents '''B'''io'''B'''ricks.

===a===
The '''a''' represents the fact that this is the '''alpha''' version of the registry and therefore an alpha part.

===X===
The '''X''' represents the part type and is indicated by a capital letter (A-Z).  Certain letters represent specific common classes of parts.  It is this letter that is most often chosen incorrectly when naming new parts.  Consult the table below for each letter's designated meaning.

===nnnn===
The '''nnnn''' is a 4-6 digit number representing the specific part itself.  Together with the letter specifying the part type, it constitutes an unique designation of the part.  Attempting to add a new part with an existing part name will cause an error when using the Registry.  

In general, similar parts, especially those created at the same time, will have part numbers that are close together.

==Future naming schemes==
There is a recognition that the current registry naming scheme has a few flaws.
#Existing conventions are not enforced uniformly leading to confusing part names.
#Not all part types are represented in the table above and there is no formal mechanism for creating new part types.
#The existing naming scheme may not convey enough information.  (See the [[Synthetic Biology:Vectors/Nomenclature | vector naming scheme]] for a scheme that seeks to convey more information in the vector name.)
#The part types are inconsistent in their resolution.  (For instance, all yeast parts are grouped together but ''Escherichia coli'' parts are divided out.)

There is a preliminary proposal for a new Registry organization at the [[Registry Wish List#Registry Organization | Registry Wish List]].  Please contribute to the discussion.
