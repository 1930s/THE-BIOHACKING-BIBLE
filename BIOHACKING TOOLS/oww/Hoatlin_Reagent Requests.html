==Hoatlin Antibodies==
We are committed to creating and maintaining top-quality, characterized antibodies for Fanconi research.  We have shipped our antibodies to approximately [[Hoatlin:Labs we've shipped to:|65 labs in 12 different countries]].  To request characterized antibodies or other published reagents from us, please contact Alexis at lachapel_AT_ohsu_DOT_edu.  For antibodies, please include enough detail so we can send you the best antibody, estimate how much you'll need, and send us your FedEx number and shipping information. Kindly fill out this [[Media:HoatlinMTA07.pdf|MTA]] and follow the instructions. Please note that the university requires the MTA to be completed before our lab can be authorized to send the material.

The links below will lead you to a pdf listing some of the antibodies we have available. We are running very low on some of the good ones, so we ask you to estimate how much you need. You can always ask for more if it works!  Citations relating to the antibodies are listed in the "Antibody References" link. See our secret Protocols link for getting the antibodies to work. Feel free to contact us with any questions. If you don't see what you need, let us know. Thanks to the [http://www.fanconi.org/research/Supported.htm Fanconi Anemia Research Fund] for supporting this effort and to our collaborators in the labs of Hans Joenje and [http://www.grc.nia.nih.gov/branches/irp/wwang.htm Weidong Wang] for working together so effectively.

==Additional Antibodies to Consider==

There are other antibodies available from the FA cell repository  of the Fanconi Anemia Research Fund which are distributed free of charge to FA researchers from the [http://www.fanconi.org/research/Materials.htm#Antibodies| Fanconi Antibody Project].  These antibodies were made against peptides and are affinity purified. Our lab has tested most of them against the epitope-tagged, overexpressed target proteins. '''For results of our antibody tests, click [[Media:MonnatABs.pdf|here]].''' In summary, we like antibodies for:
*FANCC, #2 (#1 has too many non-specific bands)
*FANCD2, both
*FANCF
*FANCG, #2
The FANCG #1 and FANCE antibodies did not work for us. 

The repository now has FANCJ and USP-1 antibodies available!!
