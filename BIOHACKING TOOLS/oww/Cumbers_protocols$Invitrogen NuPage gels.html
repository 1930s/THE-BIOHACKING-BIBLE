If you are using an antibody that is specific to a phosphorylated epitope, DO NOT use milk to block.  Kinases in the milk will nonspecifically phosphorylate proteins in your sample.  Use BSA as a blocking agent.  It is important to block at least overnight.  BSA is not as good of a blocking agent and you will see more background.

*8WG16 recognize the hypophosphorylated (PolIIa) 
*4H8, a phosphorylation-independent state of the CTD of polymerase II (PolII)
*Thus, the 4H8 antibody is recognizing the total polymerase II population.

RNA polymerase II carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) interacts with a large multisubunit complex that contains TATA-binding protein (TBP) and is an integral part of the transcription initiation complex. Phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II's largest subunit C-terminal domain (CTD) is a key event during mRNA metabolism. Numerous enzymes, including cell cycle-dependent kinases and TFIIF-dependent phosphatases target the CTD.
