===Talk Overview===
This talk lays out the basic intersections of property rights - copyrights, patents, and contracts - with scientific research.  The talk also examines how approaches inspired by the Free Software movement might help create a "research commons" of freely usable tools, papers and data.  Specific case studies in biological materials transfer and text mining of gene interaction networks are presented for discussion.

''Just a note from [[John Wilbanks]] - I talk about ccmixter in this, as a user generated project.  Just to be clear, it was done by one of our users, but we did fund its development!  I want to give victor credit, and jon philips (who took over as admin) now works for us at CC.  Back to your programming - jtw''
