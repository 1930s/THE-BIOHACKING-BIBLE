We are currently trying to develop a strategy for organizing our work.

*Suggestion.  If possible, focus only on the "delta" impact on biological risk & security due to synthetic biology, not the entire biological security and risk landscape.  We need to evaluate whether or not this is possible?
**What are the intentional SB contributions to risk?
**What are the accidental SB contributions to risk?
**What are the active SB contributions to security?
**What are the passive SB contributions to security?

*Suggestion. Evaluate costs associated with using synthetic biology technologies relative to other already accessible approaches.  In doing this also evaluate who will have access to these technologies?

*Suggestion. What sorts of uncertainty frame our thinking?

*Suggestion. Develop bracketing use cases important examples that inform our discussions.
**For example, an agent that is trivial to obtain, but hard to weaponize.
**For example, an agent that is hard to obtain (today), but is itself already a weapon.

*Suggestion. Consider issues of speed, cost, diffusion, and luck.
**For example, how can we evaluate whether or not we can afford to use / ignore lists of top 100 agents?
**For example, can we come up with capabilities-based strategies?

*Todo. 
**How should we make progress on these issues?  I.e., how to do the research?
