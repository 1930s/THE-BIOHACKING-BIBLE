==Feedback==
We hope that you enjoy 20.181.  2006 is the first year that the course is being taught.  Constructive feedback (critical or otherwise) is expected, welcomed, and will be much appreciated!  Please feel free to provide feedback at any point during the semester.

==Assignments & Exams==
There will be short assignements distributed at almost every lecture.  We expect that all assignments will be turned in by midnight on the day they are due.  You may discuss assignments with your classmates but we expect that you will submit your own work.  Late assignments (up to one week late) will be given 1/2 credit; solutions for assignments will be posted at the posted due date.  A family crisis or severe illness requiring attention from the infirmary and prohibiting you from all your coursework are acceptable reasons for missing an exam; every effort will be made to accommodate you in these exceptional circumstances.
