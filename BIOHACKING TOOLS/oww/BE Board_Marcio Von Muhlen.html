|general= Hey Everybody - I came to MIT directly from UC Berkeley where I got a BS in Bioengineering in May 2005. Before that I did High School in San Diego, before that I grew up in Porto Alegre, Brazil. I am a brother of Delta Upsilon and currently the RA at the Technology Chapter. My research interests are microfabricated analytical devices and heparin/heparin sulfate. 

Feel free to e-mail me if you have any questions about such things.

Cheers! Now go do something fun!

- Marcio
