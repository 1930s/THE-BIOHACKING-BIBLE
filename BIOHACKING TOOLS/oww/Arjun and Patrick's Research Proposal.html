='''BoHV-4 Vaccine carrier''' =

Use BoHV-4 (Bovine Herpes Virus 4) as a carrier to secrete a specific non-toxic antigen from a virus known to be harmful to humans, inject it into cell, and force the immune system to make antibodies against it.
<br>
Possible Viruses to Target:
Human Papillomavirus
Herpes
HepatitisB
etc.

Summary of Article:
A recombinant BoHV-4, containing a secreted form of the bovine viral diarrhea virus structural glycoproteins was created using a recombination-mediated genetic engineering approach. When rabbits and sheep were infected with this modified BoHV-4, large levels of antibodies were formed. This shows that BoHV-4 is a hopeful vector for vaccine purposes
==Necessary components of expressed antigen:==
Removal of the putative transmembrane domain
<br>
Addition of a 14 amino acids peptide at its carboxyl terminal
<br>
Immunoglobulin K signal peptide added to the amino terminal
<br>
==Why are they needed?==
'''Removal of putative transmembrane domain''': Allows for the protein product to be secreted rather than inserted into membrane

'''Addition of 14 amino acids at carboxyl terminal''': postulated and experimentally shown to increase secretion of protein; replaced transmembrane domain.

'''Immunoglobulin K signal peptide addition to amino terminal''': Forces the immune system to recognize the secreted structure.

==Why BoHV-4?==
Non-pathogenic
<br>
Low probability of oncogenicity
<br>
Capable of carrying large amounts of foreign DNA
<br>
Ability to infect several different types of cells from different species
<br>
Ability to maintain transgene expression in either differentaited or undifferentiated cells
<br>
==How to insert antigen into BoHV-4?==
Recombination of modified antigen (as discussed before) DNA with BoHV-4 DNA, Cloned as bacterial artificial chromosome.  Verify by using Kanamycin resistance gene in antigen cassette and selecting for it.

==Predicted Outcomes==
If all goes well, the use of BoHV-4 as a vehicle for the vaccine should allow for the cells to produce antibodies to the virus. If nothing goes according to plan, either the BoHV-4 is a bad vehicle or the antigen fails to allow the immune system to produce antibodies
