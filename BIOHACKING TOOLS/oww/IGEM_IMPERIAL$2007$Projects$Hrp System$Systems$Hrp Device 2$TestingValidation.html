Two promoters are tested each have a range of 8 inducer concentrations.
*pBad will have a range of 0 to 100mM added at intervals of 12.5mM[[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Projects/Hrp System/Systems/Hrp Device 1/TestingValidation/Protocolpbad| Protocol]]
*pLac will have a range of 0 to 0.1mM IPTG added at intervals of 0.0125mM. [[IGEM:IMPERIAL/2007/Projects/Hrp System/Systems/Hrp Device 1/TestingValidation/ProtocolpLac| Protocol ]]

===Device Test Construct===
For this test construct we initially need to run preliminary tests in order to find out what time intervals and what input ranges we need. To run this the range of concentrations used for promoters will be used.
This device uses a pLac promoter, the proposed range of concentrations is going to be defined from the promoter experiment, this is use a range of concentrations to cover an appropriate range of promoter. From looking at literature an appropriate range is 0-100μM.
