#Redo transformation of merR/Pmer+I13500
#*Plates in @3:25pm
#Make LC of last night's CPX and FhuA transformations into BL21 (eventually will make glycerol stocks)
#Run western blot on CPX trans. cells (check for protein expression)
#Run assay on FhuA trans. cells (test poly-styrene binding)

===merR/Pmer+I13500 Transformation Results===

Plate              # colonies     Notes
- control          0
merR/Pmer+I13500   0              :(

===BL21 Transformation Results===
<pre>
Plate                    # Colonies       Notes
FhuA (pICCBP)            38               Colonies are differently sized
pUC18                    15               2 or 3 are much smaller
F+B+CPX (colony PCR #6)  ~200

===Second merR/Pmer+I13500 Transformation===
*Spun down unplated remnants of transformation.  Saw a VERY small pellet.
*Resuspended spun-down cells and plated all of those.

===LC of BL21's trans. with F+B+CPX and pICCSP===
*went in around 4PM
