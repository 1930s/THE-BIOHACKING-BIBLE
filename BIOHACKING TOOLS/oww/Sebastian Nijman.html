Sebastian Nijman was born in The Netherlands (1975). He obtained his university training in Utrecht where he specialized in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry and he acquired a Masters of Arts degree from the University of Maastricht (Science, Society and Technology Studies). After a short “detour” through industry where he was involved in clinical research, he started his PhD in the lab of Rene Bernards at the [http://www.nki.nl/ Netherlands Cancer Institute] in Amsterdam. With the help of the first RNAi screen in mammalian cells he assigned a function to the familial tumor suppressor gene CYLD. This work has led to a rational therapeutic approach for treating the tumor syndrome that is caused by mutations in this gene. Furthermore, his work on CYLD and other deubiquitinating enzymes has had a significant impact on various fields of research. 
In 2006 he joined the lab of Todd Golub at the [http://www.broad.mit.edu/ Broad Institute] of Harvard and MIT. Here he developed novel genomic approaches to discover the functions of genes and identify new angles for cancer treatment. Much of Sebastian Nijman’s research can be considered as technology driven which allows the interaction with scientists from many different backgrounds. At [http://www.cemm.oeaw.ac.at/ CeMM] and the [http://www.kimcl.at/ KIMCL], where also principal investigator [http://www.cemm.oeaw.ac.at/?cont=people&sub=cjb Christoph Binder] is located, he hopes to find an exciting scientific environment at the interface of basic research and the clinic.
