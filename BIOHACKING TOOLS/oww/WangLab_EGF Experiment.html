=== Time for experiment ===
* 30-60 minutes
=== EGF Experiment ===
# Set the cell culture dish on the stage of microscope.
#*Change the dish cover to a piece of flat cover glass.
#*Make sure the dish is securely settled on the rack of the stage.
#*Make sure the 40x objective touches the bottom of dish.

#Start Metafluor

#Open a CFP-YFP-FRET protocal

#Use FRET-open to locate a good cell.

#Starting focusing to adjust focusing and exposure time.

#Configure-> Aquisition to set exposure time.

#Aquire one image, define regions.
#*Enable background subtraction of a constant
#*The constants are chosen by image histograms.
#*Define regions for tracing change of FRET.
#Aquire 5 images at 60 seconds intervals.

#Pause aquiring.
#*Adding 20 ul x 20 ug/ml EGF to 2 ml dish (200ng/ml), to the edge of dish.
#*Pipet (big, 1000ul) up and down 3 times to mix well.
#*Be careful not to touch anything or cause the cell culture dish to move.
#*Add events
#**Events -> EGF -> mark events.

#Start Aquiring at 30 seconds intervals for 20 cycles and the at 60 seconds intervals for 20 cycles.

#Adjust Focus if necessary.

=== Note ===
*The same protocol can be used for pervanadate experiments by changing EGF to pervanadate.
