Genomics is the study of an organism's entire genome. This includes functional genetic screens and genomic profling techniques, such as SNP arrays, ChIP-Chip, and microarrays. Investigation of single genes, their functions and roles is something very common in today's medical and biological research, and cannot be said to be genomics but rather the most typical feature of molecular biology.
