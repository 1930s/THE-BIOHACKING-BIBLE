So the next step of the project is combining everything. As I  see it, there are a few separate pipelines:
* Seq&rarr;blast&rarr;gene names (this much is Zach) &rarr;[http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph/ PolyPhen] (Mike needs to do this) or to GenBank&rarr;mutations (xiaodi is doing this)
* Seq&rarr;blastSNP&rarr;rs#(xiaodi's script)&rarr;omim (if it works)(cindy's)&rarr;pubmed (resmi's script which is almost done but has a bug)

As of now, the chunks that have been written and don't have bugs are combined (but this was their natural state).  In class we need to debug and write any missing code so we can get these two big pieces up and running asap.
