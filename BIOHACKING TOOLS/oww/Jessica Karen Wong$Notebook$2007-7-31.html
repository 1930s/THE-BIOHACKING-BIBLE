==Sequencing==
*E0240-1AK3 - double Mfe piece went in backwards, discarding
*E0240-3K3-E-S - Fwd failed, Rev shows a 1bp mutation around 700
*E0240-3K3-E-X - Full coverage, mutation at same spot as in ES
*I2055-3K3-1 - looks fine 1-95 and 208-end, has promoter and is scarred
*I2055-3K3-2 - wrong, discarding
*I2056-3K3-1 - Fwd failed, Rev shows scarring, waiting on redo to see if front is ok
*I2056-3K3-2 - Mutated, discarding
*I2057-3K3-ES - Fwd failed, 267-end looks ok
*I2057-3K3-EX - Rev failed, 1-769 looks ok

Doing a site directed mutagenesis on BBed E0240's, giving up on getting devices into 1AK3


==Other==
*Minipreped overnight cultures of J23116 and J23100 - will save for later
*Prepared Chemically Competent DB3.1 cells
