==I2057==
*Heat shocked overnight digest of I2057 with Mfe1/Nsi1
*PCR cleaned I2057 digest
*Ligated with both 1AK3 and 3K3
*Transformed 3ul of each and plated on Kan

==I2056==
*PCR cleaned overnight scarring PCR of I2056
*Ran gel of I2056 and overnight colony PCR's
**Nothing showed up the right size
*Got sequencing in for I2056
**Sequence only matched plasmid, none of the part was present
*Discarded cleaned PCR
*Rebuilding part: ligated R0040-J04650-1AT3, R0040-J04650-1AC3
*Transformed 3ul of each and plated on appropriate antibiotic
*Made new Chlor plates, running low


==T9002==
*Ligated T9002-3K3 and transformed
*Also spun down rest of T9002-1AK3 transformation and plated

==E0240==
*Redid BioBricking PCR of E0240-1AK3 on a gradient
**12 10ul PCR's from 51c to 57c 
**Used Taq and too short elongation time 1:45
*This product was not the right size (rightmost lanes)
**Has some at 3kb and some at around 10kb, but should be 4kb
*Redid BB PCR overnight on same gradient with Vent and proper 2:40 elongation time
*Made new overnight of E0240-1AK3 b/c were running out of DNA
*Religated and transformed E0240-3K3

==I2055==
*Scarred product in 1AK3 had 5 colonies on the transformation plate
*Colony PCR-ed all 5
*Ran a gel and nothing showed up again (the first five lanes after the ladder)
*Did a positive control with P1010 from the registry to  make sure we're doing colony PCR right
**1 10ul with VF and VR and extension time 1:30
