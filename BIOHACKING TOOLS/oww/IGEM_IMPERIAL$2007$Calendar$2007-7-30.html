== Questions ==


== Debriefing ==
The debrief session was attended by Professor Freemont. A number of issues were raised; these are described below.

===Projects===
The work done on the various projects was reported at the debriefing session.

====Biofilm====
*General protocols available for E Coli experimentation were recorded.
*Work was started on protocols specific to the Biofilm project
*It was reported that 4 constructs would be employed. Also, it was suggested, that due to some parallels with last year's Imperial project, these established constructs could already be exploited. 
*More work needs to be done in terms of reporter mechanisms, e.g. DSRed.
*This project proceeds by employing "test" constructs until the required HRP constructs are made available.

'''Problems/considerations'''
*Can E Coli Polymerase be employed in the ''in-vitro/in-veso'' system, or is T7 the only possibility?
*DSRed, was suggested as a possible reporter system; especially since this would already be characterized from one of the other projects. Are there other reasons which could/could not warrant its use in the Biofilm project? - especially, consider time-scale of operation.

====HRP====
*The constructs to be pursued further were discussed.
*Relevant protocols to be developed per device.

====In-Veso====
* Email Christina from the "Vesicles" Division concerning considerations/issues/problems raised including:
*#Stability/Rigidity of vesicles
*#No. of ribosomes possibly accommodated by vesicles - in other words, size considerations.
*#Polymerase restrictions - only T7 employable?
*#Methods of fabrication  
*#Materials employed - particular w.r.t. phospholipid compostion/mixture used.
*#Storage of vesicles, especially at temperatures of 4 degrees Celsius.
*#Communication methods across membrane.
*#Alternative means of forming pores within membrane, since a-hemolysin toxin is not permitted during our project work.
*Also, included in this email, should be the relevant research papers on which our methods/project work to date has been based.

====Cell-by-Date====
*Proposed new reporter mechanism, involving DSRed - inherent long degradation time.
*Issues overlapping with In-Vitro/In-Veso systems, e.g. non-T7 polymerase, etc.
*Cmv was initially proposed as a constitutive promoter; however, this can only be used successfully within mammalian cells; not prokaryotic cells.
*The list of experiments to be conducted should be completed.
*(other issues covered? '''input required''')

===Ambitions by end of week===
*Start production of media within lab. 
*Hopefully start cloning for E Coli System.
*Organize division of labour between different projects, and, within the projects themselves, especially w.r.t labwork.
