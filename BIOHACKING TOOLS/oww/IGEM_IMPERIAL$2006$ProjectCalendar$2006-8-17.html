==Discussion on our protocols (Tom & Vincent)==

===General Issues===
*Need to calibrate Victor 3 to get OD600=f(ABS_490)
**grow a culture overnight
**put the culture on ice for 1h
**measure and record OD600
**create a dilution series of culture (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7)
**inoculate a 96 well plate with the dilution series, keep it on ice.
**Use Victor 3 to read ABS_490
**plot OD600 function of ABS_490
*Need to create a fresh batch of T9002 and make of frozen stock of it.
*Need to change AHL dilution series to fit better log scale.

===T9002===
*Should use full 96 well plate: 8 repeats. New layout needed (8 repeats + standard GFP + blank medium) - <font color=green>'''Done!'''</font>
**means that we need to work-out new volumes needed for cultures and AHL inoculation
**1.5ml Eppendorf are too small, need bigger ones 2ml
***<font color=green>TH: Sue has advised we don't have any 2ml Eppendorf tubes, would need to use the little white capped tubes</font>
*Need to make final decision on dilution method - <font color=green>'''Done!'''</font>
*To get pre-warmed media we should always store next volume needed in the incubator and not the full bottle. - <font color=green>'''Done!'''</font>
*We want to put AHL first into Eppendorf (before culture) ( can't remember why ?) - <font color=green>'''Done!'''</font>
*Check variability of Victor 3 measurements (multiple reading of the same plate) - <font color=green>'''Done!'''</font>
*Waterbath doesn't seem to be helpful (cells are dying). it is about doing only one measurement or finding an available 37C shacker. - <font color=green>'''Done!'''</font>
*Need to build a standard Excel sheet to process experimental data automaticaly:
**convert ABS_490 -> OD600 - <font color=green>'''Done!'''</font>
**normalize GFP with OD600 - <font color=green>'''Done!'''</font>
**normalize GFP with standard GFP solution and remove background - <font color=green>'''Half-Done!'''</font>
**Compute Vmax and Km

===J37016===
*Should benefit from all the improvements done on T9002. It is the same thing at the end of the day.
*We assume that we will be at steady state after 4h.
*8 repeats + standard GFP + blank medium. Need standard layout.
*Need Excel sheet to workout data processing + parameter extractions.

===J37015===
*Need to validate that OD=0.1 helps to control positive feedback
**diluting a culture of cells during a all day between OD=0.05 and 0.2
**test GFP level at the end of the day to assess LuxI level
**positive control with o/n culture
*We would create a stock in the -3C fridge of this low density cell culture if it helps to avoid saturation.
*To characterize we would then induce with AHL at min level of sensitivity of T9002
*Need to set-up a protocol to assess GFP level in J37015 in time
