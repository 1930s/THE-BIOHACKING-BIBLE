The EHOP computer is a proof of principle for harnessing the machinery of the cell for the purposes of computing.  Segments of DNA can also act as digital storage devices, since a sequence of forward and backward units are analogous to a sequence of 0's and 1's.

Our system also has implications for basic biological research.  For example, the burnt pancake problem is a model for studying rearrangements of syntenic gene regions during evolution.
