==August 7==
#Pour new SUMO gel -DONE
#Pour new small gels -DONE
#Set up overnights for the following experiments:
##Nocodazole arrest -DONE
##Induction experiment -DONE
##Make more unarrested 403 for phosphatase Western -DONE
#Make media for the nocodazole arrest. -DONE
#Plan EVERYTHING -CHECK
##Cloning
##Finalized experiments
##What to do about luminol/ECF deal? - OOPS, stil don't know
#Integrate new-found numbers/data in to model -DONE
##Maybe update model to include Michaelis-Menton kinetics -NOT YET, talk to Ty

==August 8==
#Do nocodazole arrest! -CELLS WON'T GROW:(
#Do induction experiment! -DONE
#Set up overnights for the following experiments: -MOVED UNTIL TOMORROW
##Fus3/Active Fus3 gels
##Phosphatase control
#PCR up pGEV out of ACLY700 -DONE
#Run a gel of the PCR -DONE
#If there's time, run a second gel and extract and purify the pGEV (which might not be pGEV, based on the sequencing data) -DONE

==August 9==
#PCR amplify the pGEV band I purified yesterday -DONE
#PCR out GEV insert from the original pGEV DNA -DONE
#Run gels of these PCRs and do gel extraction -DONE
#Digest pGEV - no time
#Setup overnight of pRS-405 in DH5alpha, in LB + Amp -DONE
#Streak new plate -DONE
#Setup overnight of samples for Fus3, etc -DONE

*Unfortunately, I've got a cold and need to rest:(

==August 10==
#Prep Fus3 samples (all the way to sample buffer) and store -DOne
#Get concentrations on all DNA - DONE
#Miniprep 405 out of E. coli -DONE
#Streak out new 403 plate from freezer stock -DONE
#Digest pGEV, run on gel to check -DONE
#Design diagnostics for prs405 DNA -DONE
#Digest 405 -DONE
#Do PCR cleanup - DONE

==August 11==
#Make new SCR-u-h media!
#Do native extraction and phosphatase experiment on Noc. arrested yeast
#Load SUMO gel and start run
#PCR up GEV insert out of miniprepped pGEV DNA

==August 12==
#Gel-extract and purify all digests/PCRs. -DONE
#Check on SUMO gel l- SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG.  CHANGED ALL BUFFERS, CHECKED ALL CONNECTIONS, SET UP AGAIN.  DID NOT SEE BUBBLES AT ALL.  1 HR LATER IT HAD MOVED A LITTLE BIT....

==August 13 ==
#The plan was to set up the transfer of my gel today, but whatever problem was present yesterday is also present today.  I think a wire must have snapped inside the gel box?  It's giving 400 V but only 2 mA of current...

==August 13, 2006==
#Digest my new PCR-ed fragments that hopefully are pGEV with the double digest -DONE
#At the end of the day, do the ligation
#Think about this week's very complicated schedule -DONE
#Set up overnight of my newly-streaked-out 403 cells to do noc. arrest and also to set up new samples for phosphatase control -DONE
#Get opinions on induction experiment -DONE
#Set up new overnight for another induction
#Scrap old SUMO gel and pour a new one
#Prep and run 2 new small Fus3/etc gels -DONE
