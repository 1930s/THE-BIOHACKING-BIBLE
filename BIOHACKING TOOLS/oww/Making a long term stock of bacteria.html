==Introduction==
Whenever you successfully transform a bacterial culture with a plasmid or whenever you obtain a new bacterial strain you will want to make a long term stock of that bacteria.  Bacteria can be stored for months and years if they are stored at -80C and in a high percentage of glycerol.
