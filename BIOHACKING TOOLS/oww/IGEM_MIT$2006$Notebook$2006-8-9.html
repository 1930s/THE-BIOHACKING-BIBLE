==Smells!!!! : )==
*the banana and wintergreen generating devices are assembled and WORKING!!! YAY!!! what an exciting day :-D

==Our New Biobricks!== 
Let's give a big warm welcome to: 
#J45100 (Prom40+RBS30+BSMT+Term15) [A/T]
#J45120 (Prom40+RBS32+BSMT+Term15) [A/T]
#J45170 (PromOS+RBS32+BSMT+Term15) [A/T]
#J45200 (Prom40+RBS30+ATF1+Term15) [A/T]
#J45220 (Prom40+RBS32+ATF1+Term15) [A/T]

We will also be updating the registry with all of our intermediate parts as well. Here's a quick outline of our planned number scheme: 

#J45098 (BSMT+Term15) [A/K]
#J45099 (RBS30+BSMT+Term15) [A/T]
#J45119 (RBS32+BSMT+Term15) [A/T]
#J45199 (RBS30+ATF1+Term15) [A or A/K]
#J45219 (RBS32+ATF1+Term15) [A or A/K]

And, there are always our coding regions...
#J45001 (SAMT) [A]
#J45002 (BAMT) [A]
#J45004 (BSMT) [A]
#J45008 (BAT2 with SpeI site) [A/T]
#J45014 (ATF1 with mutation to eliminate EcoRI, but still has a random mutation) [A]

J453xx, 4xx etc will be for the next devices we build.

==To do==
#check 42 sample sequencing order in VectorNTI
#*remember ATF1 parts prob have 2 RBS
#SMELL LCs (and miniprep plus sequence promising ones)
#*remember that the ATF1 assembly is a mutant version [J45014] 
#ATF1 mutagenesis (??)
#make LCs of pUCP22 cell colonies (LB Amp)
#make LCs of overnight transformants (all in LB A/T, some with SA or IA)

==BAT2 mutation primers to eliminate SpeI==
