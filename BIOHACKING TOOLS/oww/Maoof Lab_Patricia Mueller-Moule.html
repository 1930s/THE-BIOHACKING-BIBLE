I am a senior research associate in the Maloof Lab in the section of Plant Biology at UC Davis. Before joining the lab I worked as an independent postdoctoral researcher in Peter Westhoff"s lab at the Heinrich-Heine-University in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany. I was supported by a Emmy-Noether fellowship, phase I, from the German Research Agency DFG, and worked on a vitamin-C-deficient Arabidopsis thaliana mutant called vtc2.

I will be working on characterizing the shade avoidance responses of various light signaling mutants.
Also, I will be studying the involvement of auxin in the shade avoidance response.

[edit]Outside the lab

Outside the lab I (and my husband) are busy with our two-year-old twins. During the spare time I sometimes have I like to read a book, go to the gym and do some gardening. Eventually, I hope to be going hiking on the weekends again.
