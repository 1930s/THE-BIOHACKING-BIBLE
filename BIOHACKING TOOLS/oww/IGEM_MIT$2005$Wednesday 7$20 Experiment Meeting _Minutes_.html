Experimental Planning Meeting:

PURPOSE: Do run through of experimental meeting
What do you have
What do you need

==INPUT==
'''Maxine:''' 
# Permeablizing membrane -- like making cells competent
# Attach FFK peptide to antisense agents (RNA) -> lets antisense agent enter cell -> proteins to nucleic acid -> Drew knows things -- proteins that splice out ? -- catch splicing process -- make a tadpole -- protein head and oligo tail
# mutant cells: actinomycin (anti biotic) -- strain that takes big things, or just actinomycein?
# DNA transport: what exists: conjugation? comEC system (B. subtlis) 

'''Will:'''
# Tests this morning didn't go so well
# Grew Mc4100 in M9 (doesn't fluoresce), LB
#* no pellet in M9 solution
#* LB cells resuspended in flur. diluted in M9 media
# Severe contamination -- Will != sterile
# Do the whole set of tests again (can do MC4100 when I do overnights)
# Kate says: this expt. was planned at the end of the day, and that was no good at all. 
# Would like to start dealing with OligoFlurs. --> need assembly

==HEAD UNIT==
'''Jenny'''
# scFv's moving forward

==TOXR==
'''Jenny:'''
# MalE and PhoA -- PhoA had multiple PCR products: TK says raise annealing temperature; Kate: Blast primers against e. coli genome. Though we can just excise band and use that, it makes sense to go forward and do it again
'''TK:'''
# Took protein sequences from cholera toxR -- vibrio species have similar genes, v. fischeri -- also serratia marcescens (don't really believe it is there) -- (sprayed over San Fran)
# ATCC -- cholera dna is BL1
#* go ahead and get it -- use this as an exercise
# Annotation of translation start on cholera toxR was initially wrong -- there is ambiguity -- ack!! We need to check what we ordered!!

==FECA==
'''Annie'''
# track down fur- strain -- hoping to receive -- how do we get it? RAY = Point of contact
# jen and annie talking with samantha to work out recombineering 
# where do we fuse our scFv? 3 domains: 7 fusions for one domain alone -- working out details -- having a team meeting about this at 4.30 -- should be a team decision -- can we do it in parallel? 
# FecA in process, FecA prom -- know by end of day tom. if need new primers
# FecR and FecI starting pcr

==SIGNAL PROCESSING:==
'''Ray:'''
# Testing parts, RNA based regulation from IAP 2003

==ACTUATOR:==
'''Jen:'''
# waiting on promoters, going to assemble with gfp when those are ready


Side note: lets talk about risk and danger! 
Side note: are we overextending ourselves?
-gathering materials != doing expt -- might as well gather materials

TO DO: Look into B. Subtleis
