==Agenda for Thursday, 7/19==
*Make permanent glycerol stocks of 8 tubes
*AK/AL list
*Colony PCR on yesterday's plated transformation (F2620+B0034+CPX in pSB1AC3)

===Colony Count of Yesterday's Plates===
TK's DH5a transformed with F2620+B0034+CPX in pSB1AC3

Key:
*(+)   contains DH5a transformed with digested and ligated parts
*(-)   contains DH5a transformed with only digested and ligated pSB1AC3
*BH    the plate is labeled with Bernice's initials
*JH    the plate is labeled with Jess's initials

===Colony PCR of Yesterday's 3A Transformation===
*Used 8 colonies picked from (+) Cm + Kan JK plate
*Streaked those 8 colonies also onto Cm and Cm + Kan plates for antibiotic screening
*Used the OWW Knight Protocol for Colony PCR (see below)

====Colony PCR Protocol (OWW, Knight)====
#Prepare one sterile 0.6mL tube with 20 µl ddH20 for each colony
#Prepare LB-agar plate with appropriate antibiotic to use as index plate
#Pick single colony using a pipetman with sterile tip. The pipettor should be set to 3µl
#Innoculate tip with colony into tube. Pipet up and down to ensure cells are transferred to tube. Pipet 3µl of cells suspended in water onto index plate.
#Repeat for as many colonies as you intend to pick

Reaction Mixture:
*9µl PCR supermix
*0.25 µl 40µM VF2
*0.25 µl 40µM VR
*0.5 µl colony template

PCR conditions:
#95C for 15 mins
#94C for 30secs
#56C for 30secs
#68C for 1 min per kb of expected product
#Repeat 2-4 39 times
#68C for 20 mins
#4C forever

*Run a gel to determine amplification product length
**5 mins @ 40V, remainder @ 85V
**Used 50ml gel with two rows of 6-wells each
**Row 1, well 1: 1kb ladder
**Row 1, wells 2-5: Colony PCR samples #1-4
**Row 2, well 1: 1kb ladder
**Row 2, wells 2-5: Colony PCR samples #5-8

===Permanent Glycerol Stocks of DB3.1, F2620, B0034 and E1010===
*SK: Made eight cryogenic vials of glycerol stock; all have 1 mL 40% glycerol + 1 mL liquid sample
*All vials in the white sticker labeled "iGEM 2007 DH5alpha" -80 degree freezer box
*DB3.1, 2 vials = original with pSB3K3 (K+)
*F2620, 2 vials = transformed (A+)
*B0034, 2 vials = transformed (A+)
*E1010, 2 vials = transformed (K+)

===Liquid Culture of BBa_I13500===
* Last night's growth was unsuccessful, so it was redone

===Made More Plates===
*just LB: 10 plates
*Cm+Amp: 30 plates
**Cm: 50 µg/ml
**Amp: 30 µg/ml

==Protocol for de-phosphorylating DNA before ligating==
*Add 1 ul Calf Intestinal Phosphatase or Alkaline Phosphatase
*37 C for an hour
*Heat Kill
*Purify on Gel
