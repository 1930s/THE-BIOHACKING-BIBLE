'''Ingredients needed:'''

* 12.75L [http://www.millipore.com/catalogue.nsf/docs/C7658 MilliQ Water]
* 113.7 grams [http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/search/ProductDetail/SIAL/A7002 Agar]
* 1584 grams [http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/search/ProductDetail/SIGMA/S8501 Sucrose]

'''Procedure:'''

#add 12.75L of [http://www.millipore.com/catalogue.nsf/docs/C7658 MilliQ water] to a large pot with a capacity around 20Ls.
# Place on heating device, place lid on the pot, and bring to a boil
#When boiling is achieved, add a stir bar, and begin stirring.
#Add the following ingredients in specified order, while stirring with a long spoon(in the same rotation as the bar) to help facilitate the even mixing of ingredients and prevent clumping.
##113.7 g [http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/search/ProductDetail/SIAL/A7002 Agar]
##1584 g [http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/search/ProductDetail/SIGMA/S8501 Sucrose] - give Agar and sucrose a few minutes to disolve into water before adding additional ingredients, but be diligent not to allow a boil over.
##396 g Brewers Yeast - should suspend into solution rather easily as long as you add it gradualy
##680 g Cornmeal - Same percautions as the Yeast
#allow this to cook up for about 5-10 minutes, as the cornmeal absorbs water and thickens the food.
#Remove from hotplate, and remove stir-bar
#Place pot in an autoclavable tray with about 1 inch of hot tap water in the bottom.
#Autoclave this on a Liquid cycle for 20 minutes(It should take about 50 minutes in all with build up and releasing of pressure).
#Empty water from tray and place it(with pot) on floor, on top of mixing stand.
#Remove lid from pot
#attach stirring paddel to mixer, and lower into food so the stirrer comes about half an inch from the bottom of the pot.
#set the speed at about medium, and use a fan to cool faster depending on your patients.
#Once the temperature of the mixture reaches 65C, add 150ml [[Helfand:tegosept solution | tegosept solution]]
#Pour into food strainer, and using trays of vials, dispense approximatly 3/4 of an inch into each tray.
