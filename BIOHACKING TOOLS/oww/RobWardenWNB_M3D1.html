==Choosing a SAGA Subunit==
{|
|Purpose
|To choose a SAGA gene that when deleted will produce viable phage with an interesting phenotype.

===Decision===
We are going to delete Spt8 in the context of the following genome:<br>
'''FY569:   "a" ura3-52 leu2d1 spt7-223 his4-917d lys2-173R2'''<br>
This will create the SALSA complex!

==Primer Design==
===Forward Primer===
*Landing Sequence (first 20 bases of URA3): ATGTCGAAAGCTACATATAA
**Tm = 54 C
**Ta = 49 C
**GC Ratio: 30%
**There is also a large hairpin
*Tail Sequence: '''ACTAAAGGCTCAGTTTTTTTTTTTTTCTTCTTTTACGTA'''
*Complete Oligo: '''ACTAAAGGCTCAGTTTTTTTTTTTTTCTTCTTTTACGTA'''ATGTCGAAAGCTACATATAA
**Tm = 78.1 C
**GC Ratio: 27.1%
**Retains hairpin from landing sequence

===Reverse Primer===
*Landing Sequence: Top - 5'-TGCGGCCAGCAAAACTAA-3'  Reverse Compliment - 5'-TTAGTTTTGCTGGCCGCA-3'
**Tm = 52.2 C
**Ta = 47.2
**GC Ratio: 50%
*Tail Sequence: Reverse Compliment: '''TATGATTATGATTATGGTTATGATTATTATTACAACTCA'''
*Complete Oligo: '''TATGATTATGATTATGGTTATGATTATTATTACAACTCA'''TTAGTTTTGCTGGCCGCA
**Tm = 78.5 C
**Tm = 73.5 C
**GC Ratio: 29.8%

==PCR==
PCR Mixture:

 Template       		1 ul pRS406 (=100 ng)
 Forward Primer 		1 ul (=100 pmol)
 Reverse Primer 		1 ul (=100 pmol)
 PCR Master Mix*		20 ul of 2.5X stock (see REAGENTS LIST)
 H2O            		27 ul

Protocol:
#Add water to a PCR tube.  Add 28 ul to another tube.
#Add primers
#Add template to first tube
#Add PCR Mix and pipette up and down
#Place in thermal cycler to undergo:
#*95° 4 minutes
#*95° 1 minute
#*40° 1 minute
#*72° 3 minute
#*repeat steps 2-4 5 times
#*95° 1 minute
#*45° 1 minute
#*72° 3 minute
#*repeat steps 6-8 5 times
#*95° 1 minute
#*50° 1 minute
#*72° 3 minute
#*repeat steps 10-12 30 times
#*72° 10 minutes
#*4° forever (or until one of the teaching faculty removes the reactions and stores them in the freezer)
