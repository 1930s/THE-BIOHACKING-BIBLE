==To Do==
*Redo PCR's of E0240, I2055, and colony
*Re-digest B0032
*Re-transform B0032 from Igem Distribution Kit
*Replate yesterdays' transformations
*Analyze the PCR gels
*ligate and transform new devices?

==PCR==
[[Image:6-28.jpg|thumb|left|Gel from 6/28/07]]
*Diluted dNTP's to 2.5uM
*Did a 10 ul colony PCR on the 7 colonies of blue C
*Did a 100ul preparatory PCR of E0240 at 49.5
*PCR'ed I2055 on a gradient (12 10ul)
*Ran a gel - Top is I2055, bottom Left is colony and bottom Right is E0240
**E0240 has a very bright band at the right size
**Colony PCR's didn't show
**I2055 looks hazy but there might be something there?
*PCR cleaned E0240

==B0032==
*Digested the B0032 stock on 1A3 (in the measurement kit box) with EcoR1 and Spe1
**DNA concentration was very low 45.2 ng/ul - hopfully that's ok
*In case that batch is bad we transformed the Igem Distribution of B0032 to grow it up

==RBS Tester==
*Yesterday's overnight transformation plates had no growth yet again
*Spun down and replated the rest of yesterday's transformation
*Ligated B0032-J04650-1AT3 and B-J-1AC3 from today's digest of B0032
*Transformed today's ligation and plated for overnight
