== My job here ==
I'm a ''Short-term Research Worker'' [[Chandra_Lab|here]] interested in Structural & Systems Biology. I'm currently working on the TIM barrel <math>(\alpha/\beta)8</math> fold - probabaly the most functionally versatile protein scaffold, adopted by enzymes catalyzing a wide variety of reactions. This, & the lack of any substantial sequence homology between the proteins belonging to this fold family motivate work in the direction of deciphering the structural principles common to these proteins.

== Interests ==

==== Research ====
* Modeling and simulation of biochemical networks

===== I'm an interested outsider to =====
* Computaional Geometry
* Bioinspired Computing
* Computational Origami

== Talks n Articles ==
* An [[:Image:Cancer-an_article.pdf|article]] my colleague and I wrote proposing a theory for caricinogenesis, considering it as an evolving disease.
* Here's a [[:Image:Chandra-LabMeets-Cancer.pdf|talk]] I gave in the lab on Cancer Systems

Final year student of Ind. Biotechnology (B.Tech) at the [http://www.annauniv.edu/biotech/ Centre for Biotechnology], Anna University, Chennai. At our centre, I worked with [http://www.annauniv.edu/biotech/pgautamcv.htm Prof. Gautam] at the Computational Biology Lab during the final few projects. I joined the Chandra Lab at IISc for working at my under-graduate thesis. [http://arjun.krish.googlepages.com My homepage] houses more about my bio, scientific inspirations & pursuits.
