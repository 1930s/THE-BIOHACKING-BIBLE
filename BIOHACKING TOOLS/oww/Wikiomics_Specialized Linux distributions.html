== BioKnoppix ==

[http://bioknoppix.hpcf.upr.edu/ BioKnoppix] is a customized distribution of Knoppix Linux Live CD. With this distribution you just boot from the CD and you have a fully functional Linux OS distribution with open source applications targeted for the molecular biologist. Beside using some RAM, Bioknoppix doesn't touch the host computer, being ideal for demonstrations, molecular biology students, workshops, etc.

== BioBrew ==

== DNALinux ==

[http://www.dnalinux.com/ DNALinux] is a [http://www.slax.org/ Slax] based Live CD with bioinformatic programs. Since it uses RAM instead or harddisk, the user has the option to load a lightweight GUI ([http://www.xfce.org/ Xfce]) or the full featured [http://www.kde.org/ KDE]. It is developed at the [http://www.unq.edu.ar/ Universidad Nacional de Quilmes].

== APBioKnoppix ==

== NEBC Bio-Linux ==
[http://envgen.nox.ac.uk/biolinux.html NEBC Bio-Linux] provides both standard and cutting edge bioinformatics tools on a Debian GNU Linux base. It is powerful, configurable and easy to maintain. It has been customised for ease of use and provides an ideal system for scientists handling and analysing biological data. Bio-Linux also comes with many development tools, providing a solid base for bioinformatics software development. It can also be easily deployed as a computer cluster.

A [http://envgen.nox.ac.uk/live_dvd.html Live NEBC Bio-Linux DVD] is also available.

== Quantian ==

[http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian.html Quantian] is a remastering of [http://www.knoppix.net/ Knoppix]. Quantian also incorporates clusterKnoppix and adds support for openMosix, including remote booting of light clients in an openMosix terminal server context. 

Some introductory material on Quantian is available in an article in the [http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/papers/quantian-tpm.pdf Political Methodologist]. The bioinformatics capabilities of Quantian were addressed in the [http://gchelpdesk.ualberta.ca/news/30jun05/cbhd_news_30jun05.php June 30, 2005 issue of the Canadian Bioinformatics Helpdesk Newsletter]. 


== Debian-Med ==

[http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-med/ Debian-Med] is a package of programs that can be installed easily on a Debian GNU Linux system. While not a distribution per se, Debian-Med is a good method of converting a standard Linux distribution into a system ready for many bioinformatics tasks.
