==LSRF==
[http://www.lsrf.org/ Life Science Research Foundation Post-doctoral Fellowships]
===Deadlines===
Deadline for application upload: October 1, 2006
Deadline for letters of recommendation: November 1, 2006
===Amount===
"The fellowship award is $51,000 per year and is meant to be a minigrant. LSRF keeps $1000 for administrative expenses and passes the rest to the fellow.  The salary scale begins at $40,000 for a first-year postdoctoral, $42,500 for a second year, and $45,000 thereafter. The fellow, not the advisor, will control expenditure of the remainder. It can be used for fringe benefits, travel to the host institution, travel to visit the sponsor and to the LSRF annual meeting. However, its main purpose is to support the fellow's research expenses."
