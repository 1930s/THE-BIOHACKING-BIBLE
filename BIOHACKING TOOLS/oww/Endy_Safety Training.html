==Understanding Your Training Requirements==

*If you will be doing bench work in the lab please select one of the following to learn about your training requirements:
**I have previously worked in [[Building 68]] as a UROP, rotation student, Post-doc, Technician, etc.
**I have previously worked in a different [[department/building at MIT]] as a UROP, rotation student, Post-doc, Technician, etc. (MIT classes don't count).
**I am [[new to MIT| new to labwork at MIT]]

*If your work in the lab is strictly computational (involves no benchwork) then please see the training requirements for [[Innocent Bystanders]].

*If you do not feel that you fulfill any of these categories please see Heather for assistance.
