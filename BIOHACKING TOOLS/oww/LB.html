== Summary ==
Luria-Bertani Medium (aka L-Broth or LB Medium).  (Bertani says LB really stands for lysogeny broth.) LB is a standard growth medium for a variety of bacteria and conditions.

== Ingredients ==

#10 g Bacto-tryptone
#5 g yeast extract
#10 g NaCl

See also: [[Silver: LB Liquid]]

''Note:'' There are two formulations of LB, Miller and Lennox, that differ in the amount of NaCl. Lennox has less salt, only 5 g/L. The Qiagen miniprep kit recommends LB with 10 g NaCl for highest plasmid yields.

==Protocol==
#Mix dry ingredients and add distilled water up to 1 Liter
#Pour into 2 L flask (or greater)
#Autoclave (liquid cycle)
#* 250&deg;'''F''', 22psi, 30 minutes

Notes: We do not pH medium when we make it on the fly.  However, if it is really important, pH the medium to 7.0 with 5M NaOH (~200ÂµL).  We usually obtain this from the kitchen.
