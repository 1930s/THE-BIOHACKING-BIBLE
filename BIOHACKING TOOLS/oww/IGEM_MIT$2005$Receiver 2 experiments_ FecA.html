==Experiments==
==Make Fusion==
<b>1</b> (a) Fuse FecA with scFv at chosen points and attach chimera to known promoter (makes promoter::FecA::scFv)<br>
(b) Make reporter(GFP/lacZ/Tetresistance) with FecA promoter - makes FecApromoter::GFP<br>
(c) If needed put FecI and FecR under a known promoter.<br>
<br>
==Test fecA promoter==
<b>2.</b>Transform FecA- strain:
::FecApromoter::GFP --> Nothing
::FecApromoter only --> Nothing
:: GFP only --> Nothing
:Transform wt strain:
::FecApromoter::GFP --> light up
::FecApromoter only --> nothing
::GFP only --> nothing

==Test Expression of scFv==
<b>3.</b> Transform FecA- strain with <b>1</b>(a), (b) and (c), or <b>7</b><br>
<b>4.</b> Test scFv expression in outer membrane: Detect TAG by Ab*fluorophore --> centrifuge --> FACS
<table border=1 align=center>
<tr><th><th>FecA::scFv::TAG<th>FecA (no scFv)<th>FecA::scFv<th>FecA::TAG/OmpA::TAG
<tr><th>Fluorescence<th>Yes<th>No (-ve control)<th>No (-ve control)<th>No (+ve control)
</table>

==Test overall system==
<b>5.</b>Test whether system works: (Negative controls: no GFP under promoter, no scFv, wt FecA strain)
<table border=1 align=center>
<tr><th>+ Fluorescein<th>- Fluorescein<th> To Do Next
<tr><th>GFP produced <th> No GFP produced <th> System works!! --> Characterize system
<tr><th>Anything else <th> Anything else <th> Go To <b>6.</b>
 </table>

==What if it doesn't work?==
<b>6.</b> System doesn't work. Troubleshoot. Test binding of antibody with antigen (FRET etc). If ok, then:<br>
(a) Either choose a new point to fuse scFv with FecA. Go to <b>1.</b><br>
(b) Introduce random mutations. Go to <b>7.</b>

<b>7.</b> Miniprep plasmid DNA and insert random mutations (by either transposons/Drew's paper/circularization). Go to <b>3.</b>
