* I think starting at lunchtime the first day, and finishing on lunchtime the second day would be a good plan.  This allows those flying in from outside Beijing area (USTC team) to arrive in the morning day 1 and leave in the afternoon of day 2, just 1 night hotel accommodation needed.   The afternoon of day 2 could be spent with the Tianjin iGEM team only (as they are hosting).
