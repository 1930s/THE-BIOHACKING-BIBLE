*As of noon today, there was no growth on the plates from the transfer.

Possible options:
#Plating the rest of the LB from the transfer
#Replica-plating, in case the desired colonies didn't get transferred at all
#Re-trying the transformation
*Going with option 1. Failing that, will try #3 tomorrow.

*Procedure for plating rest of the cells:
#Place in eppendorfs and spin at 4k for 4 minutes.
#Remove all but 100ÂµL of the supernatant
#Plate.
