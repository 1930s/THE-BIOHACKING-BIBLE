Hey Hetmann,

Sorry I had  to leave immediately at 1; just to let you know tho, I only got to step 1 – pelleting; the cells were done pelleting at 1258 ish, so hopefully Brownian motion hasn’t affected them that much :D The little tubes on top of the centrifuge are clean. As for neutralization buffer (P3), we don’t have any more, but supposedly N3 is the same… I will try to call and confirm.

Damnit, I just called qiagen and the neutralization buffers ARE NOT the same; one is used for the miniprep tubes and the other for the QIAquick kit, which have different compositions =(  Let Alain know and he should be able to buy another P3…

Notes: There is plenty of P3 left.

Also, midipreps of B18 and M2-7 are complete.

The nanodrop results are as follows:
