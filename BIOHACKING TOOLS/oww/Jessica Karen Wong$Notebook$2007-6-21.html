==To Do==
*Get Jason to log in to point mutate I2054
*Make plan for next week
*Digest backbones, J04650, B0032, R0040
*PCR T9002, E0240

==Digest==
*See [[Knight:Restriction Digest|protocol]]
*Digested plasmids 1AT3, 1AK3, and 1AC3 with EcoR1 and Pst
**Used 3ul of AT3 and AC3 plasmid and 4ul AK3 to insure 1 ug of DNA
**Used EcoR1 buffer
*Digested B0032 and R0040 with EcoR1 and Spe
**Used 2ul of B0032 DNA 3ul of R0040 DNA
**Used EcoR1 buffer
*Digested J04650 with Xba and Pst
**Used 5ul of prepped DNA
**Used buffer 3 as suggested by NEB for the XbaI/PstI digests
*Incubated at 37C overnight

==PCR==
* Did a 100ul preparatory PCR on T9002 and E0240
* Based on [[Endy:Colony PCR]] 
**95.25 ul PCR Mix
***25ul Thermo Polymerase Buffer
***25ul dNTP's (10x)
***3.75ul Rev Primer (40uM)
***2.5ul Taq Polymerase
***183 Water
**1 ul DNA (3x dilution)
**3.75 ul forward primer (because T9002 and E0240 have different forward primers but the same reverse primer)
* Dilute primers to 40 uM 
** Added 730ul water to E0240F
** Added 821ul  to T9002F
** Added 925ul to E0240R  
* Did a 3x dilution of DNA samples



==Sequencing==
*Nishant prepped and sent I0255 to be sequenced
