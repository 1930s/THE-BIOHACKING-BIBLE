{{Griffitts}}
==Materials==
* Buffer PB
* Buffer PE
* [[Griffitts:Common_buffers#TE_buffer|TE buffer]]
* QiaPrep spin column (1 per PCR reaction)
* 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube (1 per PCR reaction)
==Procedure==
* Label columns and microcentrifuge tubes with the names of the appropriate PCR reactions
* Add 250 μL buffer PB to each PCR reaction
** This will fill the tube, so be careful
* Use the pipetman to carefully mix the buffer and the PCR reaction
* Transfer to a QiaPrep spin column
* Centrifuge at full speed for 30 seconds
* Dump and tap
* Add 600 μL buffer PE to each column
* Centrifuge at full speed for 30 seconds
* Dump and tap
* Centrifuge for an additional 30 seconds at full speed
* Move column to a 1.5 mL microfuge tube
* Add 50 μL [[Griffitts:Common_buffers#TE_buffer|TE buffer]] (to elute)
** Drip this directly onto the filter disk but don't touch it with the pipette tip
* Wait 1 minute
* Centrifuge at full speed for 1 minute
** Point the lids of the microcentrifuge tubes in a clockwise direction, otherwise they'll break off
