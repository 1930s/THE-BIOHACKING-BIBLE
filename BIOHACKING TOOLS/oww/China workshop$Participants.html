===Preliminary Proposals===
*E. coli Communicating Chain Construction
How much can we disturb or control the communication between microorganisms in tremendous amount? Perhaps a chain carrying signals that we want to bruit is possible to be constructed in the society of E. coli. Then we can gain a closer insight into those tiny lives.
*E. coli Oscillator
According to former work in the realm of Oscillator, we are inspired to design special gene sequence that can endow E. coli periodical reaction in certain forms to certain signals, which can be derived from other cells or be opposed artificially.

====Project 1====
'''ene circuit'''
The aim of our project is to simulate electrocircuit in series and parallel connection by gene elements. Series circuit and parallel circuit are the simplest circuits in physics. There are three eletments in it: switch, power and resistance. What we should do is to construct three kinds of bacterials functioning as the three elements in electrocircuit, seperately: one for power, the other two for resistances(R1 and R2). Light is used as a switch. The gene circuit is connected when the bacterials are supposed to light so that the flurescence proteins with different colors in the three kind of bacterials are all expressed, while the circuit is cut when we turn the light off. In series circuit, If we cut any of the resistances or power, it will result in the disconnection of the whole circuit, while in parallel circuit, the lack of one resistance will not influence the other one. Three different kinds of HSL are used as the cell to cell signals.
====Project 2====
'''Bacterial neon light'''
In this project ,we use gene circle to create a bacterial neon light with three different colors. the first repressor protein, LacI from E. coli, inhibits the transcription of the second repressor gene, tetR from the tetracycline-resistance transposon Tn10, whose protein product in turn inhibits the expression of a third gene, cI from λ phage. Finally, CI inhibits lacI expression, completing the cycle. The three repressors are connected with red, green, and yellow luc genes (a kind of luminescent gene) seperately. With the oscillation of the gene circle, the three colors of light will show up circularly, just as a neon light.

===Proposal===
Despite the exciting advancement in recent years, phage contamination is still one of the headaches that nowadays the food and fermentation industries mainly confront. Some strains with genotype like TonA is resistant to T1-like bacteriophages, but the productive performance of these strains is low because of the slow growth rates. Therefore, the producer is facing a dilemma: how can we deal with the strains lacking phage resistance, but with high productivity, and strains with certain kind of phage resistance but the productivity of which is rather low. <br />
To help those unfortunate guys, we aim at developing an inexpensive system to offer the industries a new kind of strain that can grow fast and without phage infection.<br />
There are two different strategies for the active defense:<br />
One is the ‘Signaler Strategy’, that is, let a cell infected with bacteriophages send a signal telling other cells that the enemy is coming. In this way the others will switch on the expression of TonA , making themselves resistant to the enemy.<br />
There are two key points for this strategy. Firstly, what can be used as such a signal? It should be rare in the environment in most occasions, and its number ought to increase fast after the infection. Secondly, how to switch on the expression of TonA? The response should be as quick as possible, or the enemy will invade in without any resistance!<br />
The other strategy is the ‘Sacrifice Strategy’, that is, when the phage begins to reproduce itself, the apoptosis system of the host will be switched on. The host commits suicide to avoid the propagation of the phages, and without influencing the others.<br />
Also, there is a key point for this strategy, that is, how to make the reaction as quick as possible .And another one is how to keep the apoptosis off under normal conditions.<br />
Both of the strategies might be applied to reinforce the self-defense ability of cells.<br />
