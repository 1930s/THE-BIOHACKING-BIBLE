==Materials==

*[http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/productM0202.asp T4 DNA Ligase]
*10x T4 DNA Ligase Buffer
*Deionized, sterile H<sub>2</sub>O
*Purified, linearized vector (likely in H<sub>2</sub>O or EB)
*Purified, linearized insert "A" (ditto)
*Purified, linearized insert "B" (ditto)

==Procedure==
===10.5μL ligation mix===
*1.0 µL T4 ligase buffer
*3.0 µL insert A
*3.0 µL insert B
*3.0 µL vector
*0.5 µL T4 DNA ligase

===Method===
#Vortex each item before adding it to ensure that it is uniformly mixed.
#Add them to the tube in the order given above. When pipetting the ligase, be sure not to get too much glycerol on the sides of the pipet tip.
#Let sit at 22.5&deg;C (room temperature) for 30 min.
#Place the tube at 65&deg;C for 10 min to denature the ligase.
#Store at -20&deg;C
