==ligation==
*ligate the pSB3k3(I7100) and EGFP(E0040) with T4 ligase 

==mini-prep I7100 and E0040==

==single digestion test==
*Digesting E0040 and r0040 with EcoR1. 
*Digestion system contains (totally 20uL): 2uL 10*H, 0.5uL EcoRI, 4uL plasmid, 13.5uL dH2O. 
*37℃ culutre for 3 hours.
===electrophoresis result===
* from left to right:
#1-3 e0040 and EcoR1<br>
#4-5 r0040 and EcoR1<br>
#6 Marker<br>
