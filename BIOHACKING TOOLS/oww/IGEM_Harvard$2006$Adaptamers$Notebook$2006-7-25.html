I also attempted to see if the DNA components of our aptamers were capable of binding each other. Each lane contains 40 pmol of oligo or complex. Ran a 12% gel for 1 hour at 120V. Incubation was for 15 minutes total. Denaturation: oligos mixed, heated to 90 C for 5 minutes, then rapidly cooled to 4 C for 5 minutes, followed by 5 minutes at room temperature.

The complementary sections appeared to have come together at a pretty high rate, both for denaturing and non-denaturing conditions.
