The third day of [[SB2.0]] will be dedicated to presentation, discussion, and deliberation of the four key societal issues associated with synthetic biology: biosecurity & risk, public understanding & perception, ownership, sharing & innovation, and community organization.  All conferees will be expected to participate in these conversations. 

These wiki pages are intended to supplement pre-conference discussion of possible resolutions and topics of discussion to be presented at the meeting.
