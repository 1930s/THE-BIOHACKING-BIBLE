#Use Ape to determine which enzymes to cut product with.  Cuts should yield bands that are easily distinguishable on a gel.  
#To digest make a cocktail of NEB2, Enzyme, H2O, and DNA product for a total volume of 10uL.
#*If DNA product is high copy then use only 2uL of product 1uL of NEB2 and adjust the H2O and enzyme accordingly to make 10uL total:
#***2 uL miniprep/DNA product
#***1 uL NEB2
#***.25 uL enzyme 1
#***.25 uL enzyme 2
#***1 uL BSA
#***5.5 uL water
#*If DNA product is low copy then use 4uL of product and 1uL of NEB2 adjusting the H2O and enzyme accordingly:
#***4 uL miniprep/DNA product
#***1 uL NEB2
#***.25 uL enzyme 1
#***.25 uL enzyme 2
#***4.5 uL water
#Incubate for ~30min. and then run on gel.
