=Lock & Key By Yu Tao=
==Sequencing==
===Sequencing Result===
*The correctness of R0040.J01010.E0040.B0015 is confirmed.
*If so, we have complete half of the ''Lock & Key'' section.

==Lock & Key efficiency test==
*Preculture Lock1+Key1, Lock1, Lock1+oriT-Key1(I740151), Lock2, Lock2+Key1 and I7100 DH5a for efficiency test tommorrow.
*I'd like to see whether the oriT-Key1 still functions and the cross-effect between Key1 and Lock2.
