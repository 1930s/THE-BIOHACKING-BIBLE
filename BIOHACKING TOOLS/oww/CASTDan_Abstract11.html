Abstract

<br>A method for the ratiometric pH sensing using LysoSensor
DND-192 is presented in this paper. It works in the
physiological pH range. It is based on the use of two
fluorophores which differ significantly in their lifetimes. As
the discrimination of their emissions is performed through
two different frequencies, this method can allow significant
overlap of the emission spectra. A simple long-pass filter,
or a combination of long- and short-pass filters, was used
instead of narrow-bandpass devices. Importantly, the
measurements were carried out under strong ambient
light. The method could be used in a wide variety of
applications, such as intracellular measurements,
microscopy, bioprocess monitoring, etc.
