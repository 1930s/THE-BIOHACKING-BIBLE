* I like to briefly notate every paper I read, and it made sense to put it here.  feel free to add anything more -[[User:Kelsic|Kelsic]]

== Summary ==
* Eukaryotic Chemotaxis is locally dependent rather than globally polarized.  
** Stochastic processes result in a biased-random-walk in the direction of chemical gradients:
*# Membrane receptor binding events trigger local lamellipod extensions. 
*# Direction of chemical gradient determines an angular probability distribution for membrane extension.
* a single "compass-parameter" is sufficient to specify the probability distribution of the cell's biased random walk.
** dependent upon gradient strength and angular change per extension
* Experimental - Tracking cells during migration and chemotaxis: measured PI3-kinase activation in:
** primary DCs (I think this is ''Dendritic Cells'') w/ C5a as a G protein coupled chemoattractant
** fibroblasts w/ platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)as a tyrosine coupled chemoattractant

== Notes ==
* lamellipod extension seems to initial from mostly from the leading edge (which is another way of saying that the cell is polarized)
** chemotaxis is the biasing of the direction of movement for this leading edge
* the proposed "local coupling model" - receptor stimuli within the leading edge are coupled to unitary local lamellipod extensions that leads to a small turns to the right or left
** the ''unitary'' specification seems unnecessary as long as the coupling is local.
** assumptions - ''independent spatial signaling domains within the leading edge that are each capable of triggering local lamellipod extension.''
** what could be the molecular mechanism of separation?  diffusive or segregational? it seems that both are at work.
* scaling - typical local lamellipod extensions in DCs: 
** leading edge: 20-30 micrometers
** local width, extension: micrometers
** time: 15-60 seconds
* local lamellipod extensions decouple left and right sides of leading edge, and each extension triggers a small turn in the direction of migration
** no significant temporal correlation between extensions on the right vs left side of leading edge
** slight correlation between mean extension (left vs right) and turn angle
* PI3K signaling
** PI3K concentration has cell polarization, and is activated by PDGF and C5a (PI3K indicated by <nowiki> Ph[Akt]-YFP </nowiki> tag )
** membrane concentration used for normalization (indicated by CAAX-CFP tag)
** YFP/CFP indicates PI3K local stochastically initiated pulses
*** 3-10 micrometers^2, 30-90s duration, initiated several times per minute
*** rapid and transient local production, decay through diffusion and degredation 
*** 80% of PI3K pulses precide significant lamellipod extensions 20-40 seconds later
*** significant correlation (~.15) of extension initiation within local region (+- ~6 micrometer)
* random migration in no gradient is a useful search strategy, which then naturally progresses to gradient-biased chemotaxis
* angular chemotaxis equation: P(a) = C*e<sup>(g/d)Cos(a)</sup>
** a - angle
** C - normalization constant
** d - angular step size.  typically: 0.5-4. degrees
** g - gradient strength
** g/d - Compass parameter: completely specifies directional tendencies
