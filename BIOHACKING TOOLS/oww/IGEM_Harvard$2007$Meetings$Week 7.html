<u>S.Lo's Notes</u><br>
*Perry
**GFP-mek/PDZ cell binding assay: No significant fluorescence
**In vitro assay
***Glutathione bead used
***Scale of original invitro assay not great (485/538, quorum-sensing protocol)
***Results not clear when using different pair of wavelengths (for EGFP)
**Quorum
***Drop Experiment
****Plate Receiver, lawns
****Add Red OHHL sender into middle of agar plate
****Green halo seen around center
***Rebuilding Voigt construct
****lux R and lux I controlled by lux pR promoters, GFP also controlled by pR promoter
****Perry building through PCR/digest assembly
*****Worked until attempt to put together luxR-luxpR promoter and B0034-luxI - 2kb fragment disappeared - perhaps forward primer just binds to luxI and amplifies just luxI end part
****Question: why need to rebuild this construct? Answer: more "offness" of construct
****Alain's comment: Voigt paper has luxI and luxR in opposite directions; play with Biobrick sites and make it backwards
****Harris - ask Voigt for construct? (George will email)
*George
**Switched fluorophores
***GFP/RFP folding/maturation assay?
***Growth, not induction, of T02 (small range of GFP, comparable to tetR GFP sender)
**FACS
***Overnight cultures, serially diluted (1:10, 1:100, 1:1000, 1:10000)
***Measured OD before appt (only grew up for a few hrs)
***Wanted to see lower concentrations (below quorum) w/ mean GFP per OD lower than quorum-reaching dilutions
***Redo with JT diluted multiple times, watch percent of total cells fluorescent
***Go to OD that's higher (compare/contrast quorum-reaching)

**Refer to ppt
**Preliminary results look good, ie results from two-step PCR and gel are as expected
*Kevin
**Refer to "Plates" subpage of Wiki; colony counts of MACS 
**Allow selection of white colonies, only a few red
**Flow cytometry: hard to find difference between negative and positive
***Second time - red, no white, colonies
***Fluorescent tags not compatible with wavelength?
**Outlook: Run another MACS this week, try to get selection
***Use a background that is not fluorescent (lacZ?)
***Try MACS, purifying, then going to FACS
***Focus on inserting library
*Alex
**Miniprep did not work
