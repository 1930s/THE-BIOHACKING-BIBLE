{{SJK comment|label=00:39, 26 October 2007 (CDT)|comment=While your data are excellent, you need more information in your primary lab notebook!  For example, you need to record on this page what the units are for the numbers you are writing down, and some clues as to what you are doing.  Try to imagine this scenario: you take a whole bunch of excellent data with Brian, and record it in your primary lab notebook, intending to "write it up" later.  Then, however, there is a fire drill at CHTM that ends up taking 17 weeks to carry out.  17 weeks later, you return to this lab notebook and have to figure out what the heck you were recording!  Well, I don't know if that makes it any clearer, but my point is that you need to take more notes '''''while you are taking data''''' because you will be surprised at how many little details will matter later that you cannot remember.<br><br>The notes do not have to be eloquent or anything, stream of consciousness, quick notes are much much better than none at all.}}

visually I can see the 2 yellow lines when the slit is very small but this may be an illusion also can't discern them over the meter.
