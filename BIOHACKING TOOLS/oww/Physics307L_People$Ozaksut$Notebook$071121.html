connect banana plugs from DC power supply (Soar Corporation DC Power Supply 7403) to electron gun heater for 2 minutes: .7 A current, 6.3 V voltage.  (Uchida e/m Experimental Apparatus Model TG-13)

Turn on 200V DC power supply (Gelman Instrument Company Deluxe Regulated Power Supply), connect with banana plugs to electrodes (accelerating voltage) on electron gun: 200V, 25mA.  Double check with voltmeter (BK Precision Digital Multimeter 2831 B), connected with banana plugs to the Voltmeter sockets on the e/m Apparatus: 200 V.

Turn on the coil current (Soar DC power Supply PS3630) connected in series through a multimeter (Wavetek True RMS 85 XT): 1.96 A, 8 V.
