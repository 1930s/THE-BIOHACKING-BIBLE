'''Pemetrexed''' is an antineoplastic, a folate antimetabolites, chemically similar to folic acid. It works by inhibiting three enzymes used in purine and pyrimidine synthesisâ€”thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyl transferase (GARFT). By inhibiting the formation of precursor purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, pemetrexed prevents the formation of DNA and RNA, which are required for the growth and survival of both normal cells and cancer cells.

It is used to treat [[mesothelioma]].
