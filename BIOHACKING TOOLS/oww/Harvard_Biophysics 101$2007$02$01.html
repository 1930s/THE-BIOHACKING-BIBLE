'''Post comments/questions to the discussion page''' (the 2nd tab at the top)
==Tasks to complete by Feb 6==
*Register an account on OWW
**See [[OpenWetWare:Getting_started|this page]] for instructions
*Populate your user page with the following information
**Name
**Concentration
**Affiliation & Year
**Research/academic interests
**Optional: anything else you wish to share (e.g. personal interests, photo, links)
*Link to your userpage from our [[Harvard:Biophysics_101/2007:People|People]] page
*'''If anyone has problems with the following, the TFs will schedule meetings to provide individual walkthroughs.'''
*Download and install Python and BioPython ([[Harvard:Biophysics_101/2007:Python|details here]])
*Once you have Python and BioPython installed, try running the following code
**This is done by copying and pasting the code into an empty text file and saving it on your machine.
**The code can be executed in a number of ways (described [http://www.diveintopython.org/getting_to_know_python/index.html here])
**Also, look [http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com.ezp1.harvard.edu/0596002815 here] and [http://docs.python.org/tut/tut.html here] for more information on getting started

from Bio import GenBank, Seq

# We can create a GenBank object that will parse a raw record
# This facilitates extracting specific information from the sequences
record_parser = GenBank.FeatureParser()

# NCBIDictionary is an interface to Genbank
ncbi_dict = GenBank.NCBIDictionary('nucleotide', 'genbank', parser = record_parser)

# If you pass NCBIDictionary a GenBank id, it will download that record
parsed_record = ncbi_dict['116496646']

print "GenBank id:", parsed_record.id

# Extract the sequence from the parsed_record

print "total sequence length:", len(s)

for i in range(max_repeat):
    substr = ''.join(['A' for n in range(i+1)])
    print substr, s.count(substr)

print "\nmethod 2"
for i in range(max_repeat):
    substr = ''.join(['A' for n in range(i+1)])
    count = 0
    pos = s.find(substr,0)
    while not pos == -1:
        count = count + 1
        pos = s.find(substr,pos+1)
    print substr, count
</pre>
*Modify the code to do the following things
**Process a different GenBank ID of your choosing
**Tally stretches of poly-T instead of poly-A
**Print the translated protein sequence ([http://biopython.org/wiki/Getting_Started hint]) and its length
**Create a new NCBIDictionary without a parser and use that to print the a raw record ([http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html#htoc33 hint])
*Paste your code onto your user page when you are complete.
