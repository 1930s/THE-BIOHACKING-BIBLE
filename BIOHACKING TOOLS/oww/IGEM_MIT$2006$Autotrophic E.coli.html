==Timeline==

==Progress==
'''6/30/2006''' - recieved 4 strains from [http://scholar.google.com/url?sa=U&q=http://www.biochem.emory.edu/labs/imatsum/Parikh%2520and%2520Matsumura%25202006.pdf Ichiro Matsumura] (thanks!).

==Overall Strategy==

*Reconstitute functional [http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/reaction/polysacc/Calvin2.html Calvin Cycle] in E. coli.
**making use of Synechococcus RuBisCO and PrkA from [http://peds.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/19/3/113 Parikh et al. (Protein Engineering, 2006)]
**making use of sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (SBPase, [http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/EC3/1/3/37.html EC 3.1.3.37]) or a dual-purpose SBPase/fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (SBPase/FBPase, [http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/EC3/1/3/11.html EC 3.1.3.11])
**making use of proteorhodopsin from [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;289/5486/1902 Beja et al. (Science, 2000)]

*General metabolism [http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/img/assets/4202/MetabolicPathways_updated_4.19.05.pdf pathway reference (Sigma)]

*[http://www.springerlink.com.libproxy.mit.edu/content/tmfwcmbwjwqllaxf/fulltext.pdf Review of autotrophic CO2-fixation mechanisms in Archaea]

*Jason is poop.

==To Do List==
#[[IGEM:MIT/2006/Autotrophic E.coli/Biobrick Calvin cycle enzymes|Biobrick the three Calvin cycle enzymes]]
#[[IGEM:MIT/2006/Autotrophic E.coli/Find metabolite|Find appropriate metbolite for testing the function of the three enzymes]]
#[[IGEM:MIT/2006/Autotrophic E.coli/Calvin cycle vs glycolysis|Can we run the Calvin cycle and glycolysis in the same cellular compartment?]]
#[[IGEM:MIT/2006/Autotrophic E.coli/Calvin cycle model|We need to do energy/mass balances on Calvin Cycle, etc]]

==Research Questions==
#Is there an intermediate metabolite in the calvin cycle that would be a decent test for whether all 3 new enzymes were working properly?
#Detailed work-up of the energy flux that is needed?  Would we be able to get enough out of PR in order to drive the Calvin cycle?
#Will we have trouble getting the Calvin cycle to run in the same compartment as glycolysis?  In plants they seem to use the chlorplast to help isolate metabolites.  However, I think cyanobacteria do it all in one compartment.
#How does reverse e-transport work in detail?

Only NDH-1, a 13-subunit membrane-bound complex, couples NADH oxidation (to NAD+) and ubiquinone reduction (to ubiquinol) to transmembrane proton flux.

==Strains==
''Strains are stored in -80C in the Endy lab in Autotrophic E.coli box.  AE = Autorphic E.coli, we will use that convention for non-BB strains that are stored for this project.''
