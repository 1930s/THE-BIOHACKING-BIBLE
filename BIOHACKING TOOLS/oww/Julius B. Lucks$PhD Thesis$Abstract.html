This thesis encompasses four detailed investigations in theoretical
biophysics on polynucleotide unzipping, codon usage in viral genomes, and
crystalline defects on curved surfaces. [[Julius_B._Lucks/PhD_Thesis#Introduction.2FChapter_1|Chapter One]] provides an
introduction to these investigations, as well as a basic introduction
into virus biology, which provides a useful framework for considering the
biological context of these studies.

[[Julius_B._Lucks/PhD_Thesis#Chapter_2|Chapter Two]] describes a theoretical analysis of the dynamics of unzipping
double-stranded DNA at a constant force. The central theoretical tool is the
free energy landscape for unzipping DNA, which combines the DNA base sequence,
experimentally determined base pairing and stacking energies, and the applied
force to describe the change in free energy as successive base pairs are
unzipped. We show how simulated dynamics on these landscapes recover the
experimentally observed pattern of long pauses followed by rapid jumps. [[Julius_B._Lucks/PhD_Thesis#Chapter_3|Chapter
Three]] applies the same type of analysis to the related problem of translocating
a single-stranded RNA molecule through a nanopore, with the aim of addressing
the differences between RNA translocation and DNA unzipping.

In [[Julius_B._Lucks/PhD_Thesis#Chapter_4|Chapter Four]], we discuss codon usage patterns in viral genomes. Given the
large degeneracy in the genetic code, the protein amino acid sequences encoded
by the genome of a virus can have many equivalent forms. Viruses are special
in that they require a host to express these proteins, and we study how codon
usage patterns of viral genomes can reflect this necessity. We find that the
codon usage of viral genes reflects the host-preferred codons for those viral
genes that need to be expressed in high copy numbers.

[[Julius_B._Lucks/PhD_Thesis#Chapter_5|Chapter Five]] of this thesis turns to a fundamental study in the materials
science of two-dimensional surfaces with varying curvature. Using a Gaussian
bump as a model surface, we study the geometric potential felt by dislocations,
interstitials and vacancies embedded in a two-dimensional crystalline surface
with frozen topography. For dislocations, we show that above a critical aspect
ratio, it is energetically favorable to introduce two dislocations of opposite
orientation into the crystalline medium in order to relieve some of the strain
in the crystal due to the geometric frustration caused by the bump.
