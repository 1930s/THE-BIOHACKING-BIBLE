==Description==
The Secretary keeps meeting minutes, manages the BE Board website and wiki, and puts together posters or other advertising material for the BE Student Board.  There has also been a one-page [[BE_Board:Newsletter]] for introducing the first-years and reporting on BE events, which the secretary is welcome to compile.  It is also good if people are encouraged to take photos at BE Events and upload/archive those to the website.
