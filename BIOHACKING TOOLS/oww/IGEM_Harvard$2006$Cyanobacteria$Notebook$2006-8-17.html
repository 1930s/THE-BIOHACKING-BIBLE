==Ligation and Transformation attempt #3 for stage 1 of constructs==

This ligation and transformation attempt was done for 9 things:
*B0034\sp + KaiA \xp, KaiB \xp, KaiC \xp
*J4500\xp from the 97.3 ng/uL midiprep + KaiA \xp, KaiB \xp, KaiC \xp
*J4500\xp from the 97.3 ng/uL midiprep + KaiA \xp, KaiB \xp, KaiC \xp


Did a 1:3 volume ratio because the gel cutout did not give good nanodrop numbers; the usual, 25uL competent cells per sample, plated 5 on KAN (the J4500 \xp), 5 on Carb (the B0034 and the controls), and 1 of the J4500\xp on KAN (the KaiC \xp).
