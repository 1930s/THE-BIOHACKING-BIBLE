My name is Patrick Willoughby. I am Junior with a double major in Biochemistry and Biology. I became interested in Biotechnology by talking to an old friend that recently graduated with the Biotech emphasis. I sappose my interests are in the Molecular Biology aspects of biotechnology. Outside of school I am a resident assistant in Campbell Hall. Though I really enjoy chemistry and biology I also love working with college students. My dream job would be a professor. I am taking this class because it fit well with my schedule and the title looked interesting.
