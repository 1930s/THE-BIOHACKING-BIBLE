==Incubator==
===Construction===
We grow our cyanobacteria in a modified incubator with a timer-controlled fluorescent light. The incubator has a shaking floor.
*Interior dimensions: 50 cm x 50 cm x 60 cm tall
*Lighting: 32 W and 22 W fluorescent lightbulbs (circular shape). Measured light intensity on the floor varies from 3800-4500 lux on our flask

===Current status===
This section will be updated to reflect the current contents of the incubator.
*Our light cycle is currently set to constant lighting.
**I put the timer on the windowsill above the electrical outlet
