*(optional) Determine plasmid concentration via A260 measurements or by comparing intensities of bands on gel with those of the ladder DNA (whose masses are known).

#To an eppendorf tube, add:
##Appropriate volume of plasmid for a total of approx. 700 ng DNA (usually, if plasmid prep is good, this will be 2 μL (i.e. ~350 ng/ μL)).
##1 μL of appropriate 10X concentration buffer (to determine correct buffer check compatibility of restriction buffers using NEB catalogue or going online to NEB.com [http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/tech_reference/restriction_enzymes/buffer_activity_restriction_enzymes.asp])
##If necessary (i.e. check NEB), add 1 μL 10X concentration BSA
##*BSA~bovine serum albumin
##[x] μL of dH2O to make the total reaction volume in tube of 10 μL.
##Chosen restriction enzymes.  They are at a high enough concentration that 0.5 μL of each is more than sufficient for a restriction digest.  ALWAYS ADD THESE LAST (and work quickly), in order to minimize time out of the freezer.  Keep these enzymes in their low-temp blue carrying case when out of the freezer.
#(Gingerly) flick tubes, and spin down in microcentrifuge for a second
#Incubate at 37°C (in water bath or warm room) for 1-4 hrs. (1-2 hrs. optimal) 
#(Under review)...treat any vectors w/0.2 μL CIP and incubate for 30 min at 37°C with rest of restrictions
