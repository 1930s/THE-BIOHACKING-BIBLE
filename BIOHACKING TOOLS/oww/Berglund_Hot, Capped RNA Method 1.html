Transcription used to make RNAs for splicing.  The M7cap is a GTP capping nucleotide that helps prevent degregation of the RNA during splicing.  Some papers have cited using an unmethylated cap, I found it works just as well as a methylated cap.  I have also tried not capping the RNA and I have noticed capped being better than uncapped.  The CTP is from Perkin-Elmer/NEN.  The NTP's need to be pHed to 8, and the reaction needs to be a final pH8.1 at 37°C (pH changes with temperature changes).  pH and T7 buffer are most often the reason why this reaction fails (other than template problems).  The spermidine in the buffer does not last a long time and as it breaks down your amt of product decreases.  Milligan and Uhlenbeck, 1989, Methods in Enzymology: 180 51-62 is an excellent source to be read by the serious transcriber.<br>
