PBS stands for phosphate buffered saline and is often used because it is isotonic to cells.

1x PBS is 137 mM NaCl, 10 mM Phosphate, 2.7 mM KCl, pH 7.4

To make 10x PBS,
# Combine the following:
#* 80 g NaCl
#* 2 g KCl
#* 14.4 g Na2HPO4
#* 2.4 g KH2PO4
#* 800 mL distilled H2O
# Adjust pH to 7.4 with HCl
# Add H2O to 1L
# Autoclave for 20 minutes on liquid cycle. Store at RT.
