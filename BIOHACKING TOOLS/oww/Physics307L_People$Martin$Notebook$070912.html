{{Side comment|comment=[[User:Steven J. Koch|Steven J. Koch]] 01:30, 13 September 2007 (EDT):Looks like a lot of potentially great data!  You two are off to a great start.  Description of how to adjust the spectrometer was pretty good.  A list of specific equipment you are using would be good, although not sure if your equipment has model numbers etc.  Maybe the tubes at least have some labels?  And the tube holder/power supply thing probably has a model number.}} 
==Adjusting the Spectrometer==
This took us a while to figure out how to do.  Take a known light seen and wavelength pair.  Align the dial to the specified wavelength, now adjust the spectrometer.  To adjust the spectrometer you must first remove the prism cover.  Loosen the prism's clamp and rotate the prism till the specified color of light falls into the cross hair.  Now the measurement that you get for this specific color will be correct.  Tighten the clamp and replace the cover.

==Materials and set up==
Spectrometer (Last years manual has a diagram), a spectrum tube power supply SP200 at 5000 volts, and three various spectrum tubes of Hydrogen Deuterium, and Mercury.  We set up the power supply with the correct spectrum tube in front of the spectrometer and turned it on looking through the eyepiece to see the spectrum lines incident from the light.  During our initial set up of the experiment we discovered that different results were obtained by approaching the spectral lines from the right then from the left.  We decided to fix this problem by taking measurements both from the left and from the right.

Great idea to record it both ways.  Multiple measurements will help in estimating your error, as you have done.  However, if possible, more than two measurements may make the error estimate easier.  We can discuss this next week.}}

note violet #2 was really faint and hard to see.  The measurements on this color were hard to take and there might be some error in that.

we got 10983540 m-1 +/- 11080.27 m-1 for the rydberg constant for deuterium.  this seems right because the rydberg constant for deuterium should not be much different then that of hydrogen.
