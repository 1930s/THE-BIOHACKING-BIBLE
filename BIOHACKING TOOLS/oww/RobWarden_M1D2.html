==Plaque Math==

* {10^{-8}\ \mbox{dilution}} = 10^5\ \mbox{plaque forming units}</math><br><br>

DH5 does not have an F vector so it will not have an F pilus. M13 Integrates into the F pilus, so no plaques should be seen in DH5.

==Synthetic biology is about engineering while genetic engineering is about biology.==

This is a completely valid statement.  Synthetic biology embodies engineering, ''applying'' knowledge to create a new system that is advantageous to society.  Genetic engineering, on the other hand, is very much a scientific method, perturbing, rearranging, or introducing material into a system to study the system's reaction.
