==Assembly of pSB1AC3-J45320.J45180 (J45800)==
pSB1AC3-J45320.J45180 prepped and submitted for sequencing.  Results likely tomorrow afternoon according to sequencing center (marked as high priority).
*I prepped DNA from two colonies - 1-2(Austin's Mach 1 transformation) & 2-4(Reshma's TOP10 transformation).
**1-2 - 190ng/&mu;l - used 2&mu;l for sequencing reaction
**2-4 - 268ng/&mu;l - used 1.2&mu;l for sequencing reaction
*I used 4 primers for each - VF2, VR, pchA mut forward, and osmYR.  The last two are mutation primers so who knows if they will work.
*I tried a colony PCR yesterday using pchA mut forward and osmYR.  Only 2-4 amplified and it had multiple bands with the brightest being at 1kb.  There was a weaker band at ~1900bp, the expected product length.

*100mL cultures of these two colonies were grown up overnight.  They DO NOT smell like mint this morning to either Tom or Reshma.  Austin thinks there may be a whiff of mint from the Mach1 culture.  Note that they are in TOP10 and Mach1 cells.
*Screening 16 more colonies by smell today.  Started 10 ml cultures of 6 colonies from the TOP10 transformation and 10 from the Mach1 transformation.

==Assembly of pSB1AT3-J45250.J45400 (J45600)==
*Both Austin and Reshma got colonies in Mach1 and TOP10 cells.  
**Letting these colonies grow up more.
*No transformants in IK cells.

*Started 8 4mL cultures of colonies.  4 from Reshma's TOP10 plates and 4 from Austin's Mach1 plate.  Do smell tests, prep and digest tonight (to check if it is right).
**If someone has time to set up a colony PCR on this, let me know.

==Other transformations==
*The cotransformation of pSB1AC3-J45250 with pSB3K3-J45400 into IK cells failed.
*Transformation of pSB1AC3-J45250 into IK cells worked.

==Registry==
*Submitted pSB1AK3-J45180 to the Registry.

==Smell tests==
*Use 4.4&mu;L stock IA-OH per 10mL culture
*Use 40&mu;L 0.5M SA per 10mL culture 

*50mL of each LB-Amp.  In 250 mL flask.

===Dilutions===
*Used 0.625mL of pSB1AC3-J45200 (OD600nm=0.80) in each flask
*Used 0.793mL of pSB1AT3-J45180 (OD600nm=0.63) in each flask
*Used 0.531mL of pSB1AC3-J45250 (OD600nm=0.94) in each flask

Thus, each strain was diluted back to OD 0.01 in each flask.

==Miniprep==
*pSB1AC3-J45700 <--- for possible cotransformation with J45250.J45400 -- done
*pSB3K3-J45400  <--- for possible cotransformation with J45250 -- done

==Competent cells==
*The chemically competent IK cells are not very competent.
*The electrocompetent IK cells are sufficient for intact plasmid transformation.
