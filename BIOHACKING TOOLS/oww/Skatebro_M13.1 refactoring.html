==Refactoring Steps==
#Define section A as being the roughly 2200 w.t. bp existing between 1-cutter sites: HpaI and BamHI
#List all w.t. genetic elements (promoters, RBS, cds) known to exist in section A
#*conveniently listed [http://openwetware.org/wiki/20.109%28S07%29:_Western_analysis#Part_3:_M13.1 Here]
#Find a list of all M13K07 0-cutters so that we know the maximum number of parts possible
#*list of all 0-cutters [http://tools.neb.com/NEBcutter2/listbycuts.php?name=8848374d-M13KO7&numcuts=0 Here]. Note, however, that only 29 out of this list of 64 0-cutters generate overhangs/are specific enough for our purposes. This means that we should not plan to exceed (by a large margin) 29 parts in our M13.1 design. This should not be a problem.
#Create Basic Parts (Enter dna sequence data) in the Registry for each known w.t. genetic element
#*conveniently all M13 parts are specified at the [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Main_Page Registry of Standard Biological Parts]
#Create Composite Part [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_M30110 M30110] in the Registry for Section A of refactored M13.1 genome
#Re-organize/Re-order M13 parts as see fit in design of Composite Part [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_M30110 M30110] '''= first draft of unstuffed genome'''
#Create new Basic M13.1 Parts in Registry (if neccesary) to remove all secondary functions of M13 parts
#*Do not change amino acid sequence, codon optimize changes for an E. coli host
#*Annotate and record all changes made from w.t. sequence in Hard Information and in Part Design
#*Also, state how you decided on each change and what you hope to have accomplished with each change
#**How to effectively disrupt Promoter function?
#***Bacterial promoters have two important sequence regions that interact with the RNA polymerase sigma subunit. These sequence regions are called the -10 and the -35 elements because they are centered close to -10 and -35 from the first nucleotide of the transcript. The consensus -35 element reads is TTGACA and the consensus -10 is TATAAT. Need to modify one/both.
#**How to effectively disrupt RBS function?
#***Anatomy of the E. Coli RBS [http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/paper/flexrbs/ Here]. Need to modify the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence  [TAAGGAGGT]. Also see Pubmed [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgicmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=7528374 Article] for more information on SD sequence.
#Codon Reshuffle downstream sequence repeats
#*specifically applicable to repeated copies of gene 10 and gene 11 which we don't want to loop/delete
#*reshuffling of repeated promoter/rbs sequence seems unecessary to me as I plan in future to replace M13's uncharacterized promoters and RBS with a standardized set.
#Update the Part Specification of [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_M30110 M30110] to include '''new M13.1 parts'''
#Add base pairs to insert unique restriction sites between all M13.1 parts in [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_M30110 M30110]
#*Bracketing seems unecessary to me
#Annotate w.t. 1-cutter restriction sites in [http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Part:BBa_M30110 M30110]

==Principles of Design==
#Does each part encode 1 and only 1 function?
#Is each part insulated and independently manipulable?
#Will the M13.1 phage be viable? - Is this worth being paranoid about if the other 2 are true?
