'''DNA-free Protocol'''

Routine Protocol (20ug RNA in a 100ul rxn)

1) Mixup the following:

10X DNAse Buffer   10ul
dH20               70ul
DNAse               2ul
RNA(1ug/ul)        20ul

2) Incubate at 37C for 30 minutes
3) Add 0.1 volume DNAse Inactivation Reagent (i.e. 10ul)
4) Incubate at room temperature for 2 mins mixing every 20-30 seconds.
5) Centrifuge at 10,000xg for 1.5 minutes at room temperature.
6) Pull off liquid without disturbing the pelleted Inactivation Reagent and transfer to a new tube.
