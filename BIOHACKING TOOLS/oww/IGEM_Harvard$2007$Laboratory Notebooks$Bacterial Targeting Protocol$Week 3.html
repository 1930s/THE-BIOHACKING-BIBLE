===MACS with strep and his plus cherry/red bacteria (07/02/07)===

----------

===Run the MACS with the cherry/red bacteria incorporated to see if separation occurs (07/03/07)===

#Followed [[IGEM:Harvard/2007/Protocols/Indirect Magnetic Labeling Protocol|Indirect Magnetic Labeling Protocol]]
##Used 300 ul of Strep/His and 300 ul of RFP Bacteria
##Note: OMPA1+Strep and OMPA1+His had low cell count
#Then follow [[IGEM:Harvard/2007/Protocols/Magnetic Separation|Magnetic Separation]]

===Results from MACS plate===

Observation: Still have some background in the elution fraction, instead of the plain white strep and his colonies that we expected.

Conclusion:  We may need to further optimize the wash steps, because some of the extraneous bacteria expected to be gone appear in the elution fraction.
