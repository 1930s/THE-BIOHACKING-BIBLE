==Method==
#Thaw 25 - 200 &mu;l TB buffer cells on ice.  Do not use glass tubes, which adsorb DNA.
#Add DNA, pipette gently to mix (keep volume of DNA less than 5% of the cell volume)
#Incubate on ice for 30 minutes
#*Note: If you are in a rush, you can shorten this incubation time to 5-10 min.
#Incubate cells for 30 seconds at 42&deg;C.
#Incubate cells on ice for 2 min.
#Add 4 volumes of room temperature [[SOC]] (not critical)
#Incubate for 1 hour at 37&deg;C on shaker.
#*Note: Can also save some time here by reducing incubation to ~45 min.
#*Note: Step can be eliminated if plating on Amp plates, but not most other antibiotics
#Spread 100-300 &mu;l onto a plate made with appropriate antibiotic.
#Grow overnight at 37&deg;C.

==Experimental results==
First attempt varied several parameters: incubation time on ice prior to heat shock, heat shock length, addition of DTT at 20mM.

* DTT appeared to have little effect when added during transformation.
* Incubating for 1/2 hour on ice had a positive effect, perhaps 1.5 to 2x efficiency gain.
* Heat shock of 0 or 15 s rather than 30 s reduced efficiency about 8x
* Heat shock at 30 s or 60 s gave approximately similar results. (*Edit: 50s is preferable)

Achieved efficiency was 3 x 10<sup>7</sup> per microgram.  A control transformation with Invitrogen cells was at 1.2 x 10<sup>8</sup> per microgram.
