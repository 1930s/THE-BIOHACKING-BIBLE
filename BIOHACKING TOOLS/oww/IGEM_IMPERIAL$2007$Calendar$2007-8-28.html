==Debrief==

===Experiments===
====Phase 1==== 
Inital testing of the biobricks
*pTet works 
**doesn't work below 10&deg;C or above 45&deg;C
**fluorescence peak at 25&deg;C - needed a monotonic relation between temperature and GFP expression
*pT7 - doesn't work - being re-cloned
*pLux - works at quite a high [AHL] 
**not very good fluorescence for a realistic [AHL]
**no GFP for 1nM of AHL 
**possible to change the threshold of the construct?

====Cell extract testing====
*Home-made cell extract with home-made reaction buffer - doesn't work
**Flooded the extract with DNA - still dosn't work
*Need more comercial cell extract - budget limit almost reached 
**Need to plan experiments more efficiently

===Modelling===
*Finished models for construct 1 and 2
*Currently documenting on the wiki
*Preparing for presentation

===Vessicles===
*Prepared presentation for Wednesday
*Done calculations for changes in protocols - to make the development of vessicles better
*Test again tomorrow
*Might have found a non-toxic method to create pores on vessicles - need further investigation
**Will affect stability and life-span

===Cloning of biobricks===
*All working biobricks cloned
*Making substitutes for the ones not woorking 
*New parts to be added to the registry
**Waiting for dsRed to arrive
*No further ligations
*Purified LuxR - has been ordered (USA)
**Will pursue both construct 1 and 2 for ID
