We would like to see the developement of a multitude of laboratory modules geared for use in undergraduate environments.  Module information can go from simple ideas of projects to fully detailed experiments with sample data, etc.


<br>
We are slowly filling in these modules with protocols and data.

== Modules outlined in AJP paper ==
[[Optical_Trap:Calibration|Calibration and Characterization]]<br>
[[Optical_Trap:Ecoli|E.coli rotation]]<br>
[[Optical_Trap:DNA Tether|DNA tether stretching]]<br>
[[Optical_Trap:Microtubules|Fluorescent Microtubules]]<br>


== User submitted modules ==
The following module combines aspects of the calibration and E.coli modules to make a streamlined 2 hour course for an optical trap demonstration.  It includes the calculation of the coefficient of drag for a sphere using an optical trap.  Developed by Dr. Barbara Hughey & Dave Appleyard for the Women in Technology Program at MIT.<br>
