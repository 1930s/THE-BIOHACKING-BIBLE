I completed my undergraduate BSc degree in Biotechnology from the University of Mumbai, India in June 2006.  Biotechnology being an interdisciplinary science I was exposed to diverse subject areas of biology. In my final year of undergraduate education I studied Immunology as one of my course modules and was intrigued by the central role the immune system plays in regulating efficient body function.  This spurred me to take up the Immunology and Immunogenetics masters programme here at the University of Manchester. As part of my Masters degree, I am now working on my dissertation with Dr Ardeshir Bayat and Dr Philip Day. My project title is “Identification of biomarkers in keloid disease”.  As keloids are a major clinical problem and keloids are resistant to any form of treatment, this study may enable identification of viable targets for therapeutic intervention.

I’m Dulharie Wijeratne, currently a student at the University of Manchester doing masters in Immunology and Immunogenetics. Originally I’m from Srilanka, where I have been living and completed my schooling. I was interested in subjects like Microbiology, Pathology and Immunology. I opted to do my graduation in Bangalore, India from Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences with a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology. Whilst deciding for my masters, I also gained experience on advanced molecular techniques at the University of Colombo on voluntary basis for four months.
For my dissertation at the University of Manchester I chose to work on the identification of biomarkers in Dupuytren’s Disease under the supervision of Dr Ardeshir Bayat & Dr Philip J.R Day. I would like to further my knowledge in this field.
