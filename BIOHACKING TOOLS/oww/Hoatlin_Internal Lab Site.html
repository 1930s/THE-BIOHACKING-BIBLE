==Rotation Student Tips by Katy, recent Roton==
*Getting a key to the lab during your rotation involves a short trip to the BMB office where they will gladly loan you one for the 10 week period.
*Getting a key into the MRB building is a little trickier since they don't give those keys out.  The trick is if you can get into one of the surrounding buildings you can get in the MRB.  So I went to my program advisor and got a permission waiver, had it signed by a few important people, and took it to the Parking and Keys office where they programmed my ID card to open the BRB.
*With all the lecture notes and an endless supply of journal articles and reviews to read, printing is essential to graduate student survival.  Being able to print is not always a simple task, however.  If you're lucky you will be able to hardwire your computer to the network and simply add your printer of choice.  Those of us with laptops and no network cables need to connet to the OHSU Airport wireless network in order to add printers.  Even then it is usually frustrating, so your best bet is to call someone who knows what they're doing.
