==Background==
I purified SspB using Igor's paper as a guide.

==Expression==
I obtained a clone of wild-type <u>E. coli</u> <i>sspB</i> in pET-3a (amp<sup>R</sup>, T7 promoter) from Igor and transformed NEB strain ER2566 with it.  Don't ask Igor for the clone, he has given it many times to the Sauer lab.  ER2566 is a BL-21 derivative that has the restriction systems knocked out.  Like BL-21, ER2566 lacks the lon and ompT proteases.  When growing cultures for stocks or larger overnights as starter cultures, I had 0.2% glucose in the medium to reduce <i>lac</i> promoter activity.

I started 2 x 1L cultures from a 1/100 dilution of an overnight culture.  The LB was supplemented with 150 ug/mL ampicillin and 0.2% glycerol.  At an OD of ~1.0, I added 1.0g lactose, 0.5g AmSO<sub>4</sub> and 1 mM IPTG all in powder form.  The expression went for 3 h at 37 degrees.

The culure was chilled, harvested, and resuspended in 25 mLs/L ice cold wash buffer (25 mM HEPES-Tris, 2 mM Mg-OAc, 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.6), and transferred to two 50 mL Falcon tubes.

The cells were re-harvested and resuspended in 10 mLs lysis buffer per liter (the same as the wash buffer above with the addition of 5 mM &beta;-ME and 0.05% Tween-20), then PMSF was added to 1 mM and the cells were frozen at -80 degrees.

==Buffers==
I left the glycerol and magnesium out of the buffers.

*<b>"5X" Buffer-7.6</B>:  125 mM HEPES-Tris, 2.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.6.  Start with 125 mM HEPES than slowly add Tris base until the pH is 7.6.

*<b>1M KCl</b> made with 1/50th Buffer-7.6.  Make sure the pH is near 7.6.

*<b>"5X" Buffer-6</b>:  125 mM K<sup>+</sup>-MES, 1 mM EDTA, pH 6.0.

*<b>1M NaCl</b> made with 1/50th buffer 6.  Check the pH to make sure it's near 6.

* When I prepared "1X" buffers, I added Tween-20 to 0.01%.  Although SspB is fine without Tween, most of the plastic-ware people use (like microfuge tubes) binds proteins, the Tween stops this.

==Protocol==

===Lysis===
* The cells were thawed and lysozyme was added to ~0.25 mg/mL as a powder.

* Another shot of PMSF to 1 mM and mix well.

* After lysis (about 5 mins at room temp.) 3 &mu;L of Benzonase was added.

* After the viscosity reduced noticeably, more lysis buffer was added to make each tube have 20 mLs and EDTA was added to 5 mM final.

* Transfer the lysates to centrifuge tubes and let them cool on ice for 10 minutes.  The EDTA chelated the Mg<sup>++</sup>, so ribosomes and other metal-dependent complexes are destabilized, many of their proteins will want to precipitate, this step allows that.

* Clear the lysate.  I spun for 15 minutes at 12K in the SA-600.

===Ammonium Sulfate Precipitation===

* Meanwhile, weigh out AmSO<sub>4</sub> to make 20 mLs at 30% saturation (0.164 g/mL) and place the  AmSO<sub>4</sub> in clean centrifuge tubes.

* After the spin, decant the supernatant into the tubes with AmSO<sub>4</sub> and rotate them at 4 degrees for 30 minutes.  The will precipitate SspB.  Fortunately, most other things are soluble.

* Centrifuge the samples to collect the SspB AmSO<sub>4</sub> pellet (12K, 15 minutes).

* Decant the supernatant.

* Add ~30 mLs of "no salt" 1X <b>Buffer-6</b>.  There is plenty of salt remaining in the AmSO<sub>4</sub> pellet and it has to be diluted.  I just filled the centifuge tubes with buffer.

* Re-solubilize SspB by rotating the tubes ~15 minutes at 4 degrees.

* Spin the tubes to clear the insoluble material.

* Transfer the sup. to a clean container, you should have about 60-80 mLs.


===Anion Exchange===

* While those spins are going on, prepare an anion-exchange column (usually some form of Q-column) by rinsing it with 1M NaCl (pH 6.0) and then with <b>Buffer-6</b> with 50 mM NaCl (<b>Line-A<sub>6</sub></b> buffer).  I used two Hi-Trap Q XP column screwed together.  Prep. the FPLC with <b>Line-A<sub>6</sub></b> buffer containing 50 mM NaCl and <b>Line-B<sub>6</sub></b> buffer with 500 mM NaCl.  If you plan to freeze the fractions from this step, you can add glycerol to each buffer to 10%.  This helps proteins when they freeze, but I don't think SspB needs it.

* Load the column.  I usually load by hand with a 60 mL syringe.  You can use a peristaltic pump or a super-loop, whatever you like.

* After loading, allow <b>Line-A<sub>6</sub></b> buffer to flow over th column until a stable baseline is reached.

* Run a gradient to elute the SspB.  It came off between 250 and 300 mM NaCl.  You can step the column to 150 mM, then run a shallow gradient to elute.  SspB should be a huge peak.

* I ran a gel of the peak fractions and found that most of the contaminants were toward the beginning of the SspB peak. I ditched them and pooled the majority of the SspB fractions and froze it at -80.

===Another Ammonium Sulfate Step===

* To concentrate for the SEC step, bring the thawed fractions from the anion-exchange column to 35% saturation again.  You can precipitate the prtoein overnight at 4 degrees.

* (You might want to start preparing the SEC column now).

* After harvesting the SspB, drain the pellet well.

* Add ~1.5 mL of "no-salt" 1X <b>Buffer-7.6</b> and gently shake the protien into solution. This should be enough to get the SspB into solution.  Our injection loop for the Superdex-75 step was only 2 mLs, so I made an effort to keep the volume below that.

* Transfer the protein to a microfuge tube and spin it 10 minutes to clear aggregates.  Then transfer to a clean tube on ice.

===SEC===

Pick a column that will include the SspB dimer.  An S-100 or S-75 should be fine.  Follow the manufacturer's instructions as far as maximum injection and pressure/flow rate.

<b>Superdex-75</b> (16X60 mm):

* 0.3 MPa max pressure (set pressure limit).

* 1.0 mL/min flow rate (slower generally better, but there isn't too much difference).

* When removing the 20% ehtanol storage solution, first wash the column and pump with filtered water before swithing to your buffer.

* I ran SspB in <b>Buffer-7.6</b> with 100 mM KCl, 0.01% Tween, 5 mM &beta;-ME.  (SspB doesn't have cysteins, but other aggregates might be.

* I collected 4 mL fractions.

* It eluted around a 45-50 kDa protein.

* Run a gel to check your peak fractions.  The majority of mine was in three fractions.  These were pooled.


===Concentrate===

* I concentrated SspB in a Millipore 10-K centrifugal concentrator.  You could use Ammonium sulfate and buffer exchange.  The concentration off of the sizing column was probably high enough without concentrating.

* I washed the protein to buffer exchange into a buffer I do my degradation reactions in.

* I rinsed the concentrator, pooled the protein, and gently mixed.

*  I measured the concentration after dilution into 6M Guanidine-Cl, pH 7.0 (PO<sub>4</sub>).  The extincion coefficient at 280 nm in Gu-Cl for the momoner is 12,090.

*  My final stocks were ~1.1 mM.
