===Test For How Oil Affects Fluorescence===

We will test how a layer of oil will affect the fluorescence of a sample. We think that the oil may absorb some of the emitted photons and so fluorescence is expected to decrease.
To test this we will made a series of GFP dilutions and measure how varying volumes of oil will affect the fluorescence measured. The GFP dilutions chosen had a similar range of fluorescence that is normally visualised within our cell free system.
The control will be that we initially measure the GFP dilutions before addition of oil, and also we will keep one of each GFP concentration without oil.
To limit the GFP that we use, we added oil serially so that small volumes were initially tested and to these more oil was added to increase the volume to then be tested. This relies upon quick measurements to limit the affect of GFP degradation. 

====Equipment====
*Pipettes P5,P20,P200
*96 Well Plate (black)
*Fluorometer
*Incubator 37&deg;C

====Reagents====
*Distilled Water x 1200ul
*Parafin Oil x 270ul
*Mineral Oil x 270ul

====Protocol====
'''Prepare GFP Dilutions''' <br>
We use a sample of GFP of unknown concentration to prepare a series of dilutions. We initially tested several dilutions to determine a range of 3 suitable concentrations to cover the low, medium and high fluorescence signals that we see in our experiments. The dilutions used depend on the initial GFP sample and so it is better to do some rough dilutions before deciding up final dilutions. The dilutions we used were as following:
*1ul GFP + 59ul Distilled Water
*5ul GFP + 55ul Distilled Water
*20ul GFP + 40ul Distilled Water

'''Load Plate'''<br>

*Add the following dilutions of GFP to the following wells following the schematic.
*Take an inital reading of the GFP dilutions
'''10ul of Oil'''<br>
*Then add 10ul of Paraffin and Mineral Oil to the to the following wells following the schematic. A p20 should be used to measure out the oil, in addition when the oil is added to the well it should be carefully dropped into the centre if the well
*Take an inital reading of the GFP dilutions
'''20ul of oil'''<br>
*Add 10ul more of Paraffin and Mineral Oil to the to the following wells following the schematic, this is to bring the oil volume to 20ul. A p20 should be used to measure out the oil, in addition when the oil is added to the well it should be carefully dropped into the centre if the well
*Take an inital reading of the GFP dilutions
'''90ul of oil'''<br>
*Add 70ul more of Paraffin and Mineral Oil to the to the following wells following the schematic, this is to bring the oil volume to 90ul. A p200 should be used to measure out the oil, in addition when the oil is added to the well it should be carefully dropped into the centre if the well
*Take an inital reading of the GFP dilutions
