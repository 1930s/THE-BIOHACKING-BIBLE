=Cell Substratum Adhesion, Signaling, and Migration=
Our objective here is to provide fundamental information on the relationship between adhesion molecule properties and aspects of dynamic adhesion of cells on ligand-coated biomaterials. Emphasis can range from physicochemical aspects of adhesion, to structural aspects of the materials substratum, to biological signaling processes stimulated by adhesion. A major area of work is relating both adhesion-based signaling and soluble growth factor-based signaling to the biophysical processes governing cell migration. This cell behavior function is crucial to therapies for inflammation, cancer, and wound healing as well as applications in tissue engineering.
