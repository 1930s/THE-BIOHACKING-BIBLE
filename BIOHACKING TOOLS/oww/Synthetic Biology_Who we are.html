We are a group of [[Synthetic_Biology:People|individuals]], groups and [[Synthetic Biology:Labs|labs]] from various institutions who are committed to engineering biology in an open and ethical manner.

We are currently working to 
*help specify and populate a set of standard parts that have well-defined performance characteristics and can be used (and re-used) to build biological systems, 
*develop and incorporate design methods and tools into an integrated engineering environment, 
*reverse engineer and re-design pre-existing biological parts and devices in order to expand the set of functions that we can access and program 
*reverse engineer and re-design a 'simple' natural bacterium.
