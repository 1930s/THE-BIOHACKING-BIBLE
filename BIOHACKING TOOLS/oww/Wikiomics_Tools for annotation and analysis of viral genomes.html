Provides access to viral genomes and a variety of tools for comparative genomic analyses. At the heart of the system is VOCs (Virus Orthologous Clusters), a database with built-in tools that allows users to retrieve and analyze the genes, gene families, and genomes of different virus families. The database is the source of information for other programs of the workbench for whole genome alignments, genome display, or gene/protein sequence analysis. Many of these tools can also be used with user-provided sequence data. The workbench tools are Java-based and user-friendly to allow all users, regardless of computer skill-level, to access and analyze the data.
