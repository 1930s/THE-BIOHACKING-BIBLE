Some guidelines on how to best avoid RNase contamination.

==Common sources of contamination==
#Buffers contaminated with microorganisms.  (Note that the solutions need not be turbid to be problematic.)
#Pipettors.  Keep a separate set of pipettors for RNA use to avoid contamination with RNases.  Avoid touching the barrel or metal ejector to the sides of tubes.

==Precautions==
#Keep separate a set of pipettors, glassware, plasticware, reagents, electrophoresis apparatus etc. for RNA use only.
#Store solutions in small aliquots and discard each aliquot after use.
#Clean electrophoresis apparatus.
##Wash with detergent solution.
##Rinse in H<sub>2</sub>O.
##Dry with ethanol.
##Fill with 3% solution of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. (Don't use DEPC solutions because it will break down the plastic.)
##Incubate 10 mins at room temperature.
##Rinse with DEPC treated H<sub>2</sub>O.
#Handle chemicals with disposable spatulas.  
#Whenever possible treat solutions with 0.1% DEPC for 1 hour at 37&deg;C and autoclave 15 mins at 15 psi.
#Remove RNases from glassware by 
##Bake glassware at 300&deg;C for 4 hours or 180&deg;C or higher for several hours.
##Alternatively, soak glassware in freshly prepared 0.1% (v/v) DEPC in water or ethanol for 1 hour, drain, and autoclave (necessary to destroy any unreacted DEPC which can otherwise react with other proteins and RNA).
##Rinsing with RNaseZap followed by two rinses with RNase free H<sub>2</sub>O.
#Sterile, disposable plasticware can safely be considered RNase-free and should be used when possible.
#Metal spatulas can quickly be decontaminated by holding in a burner flame for several seconds.
#Treat plasticware with RNAseZap or DEPC.
#Use RNase-free disposable tips and tubes.  Use sterile forceps to transfer items to racks.
#Use gloves from a fresh box at all times.  Don't touch the gloves to any surface that might be contaminated with RNases (like yourself, door handles, refrigerators, freezers etc.).

==Notes==
*According to tests run by Ambion, autoclaving H<sub>2</sub>O is sufficient to remove most (but not all) RNase activity from water. <cite>AmbionDEPC</cite>
