==Input==
*We don't know if the fluor. oligos/molecules are even entering the cell
*Check on mic. settings
*Check for autofluor?
*Controling the pH: fluor. is an indicator
*Maybe electroporation isn't the best idea
*Lets clean up our technique so we know how to test our system
*Lets talk to the advisors -- need some new plans

==Head Receiver==
*For the ToxR system, do we need TT?

==ToxR==
*atcc -- order primers
*start assemblies if parts arrive

==FecA==
*Lab: 
*# Making FecA', quickchange
*# coordinating for making parts
*Ordering primers for fusion, and fecA promoter
*Gathering materials for transformation
*#Xgal and IPTG for QuikChange
*Knockouts: getting constructs -- ASAP 

==Signal Processing==
*An experiment will happen if assemblies arrive
