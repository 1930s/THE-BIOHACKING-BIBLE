*Got growth on:
**T9002
***3K3 (from both sequential and double digests)
**I2055
***1AK3
**E0240
***3K3
***1AK3 (2 colonies)

*Will colony PCR
*Gel of I2055 (with promoter) looks ok, will sequence to make sure.

*PCR cleaned I2055
*Double M/N digest in buffer 2

*I2056 doesn't seem to grow in o.n. amp/tet culture...trying with just tet.


*Ligating T9002 into 1AK3
