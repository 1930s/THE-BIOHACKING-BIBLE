PCR is an acronym for polymerase chain reaction.  It is a method for amplifying DNA ''in vitro''.

==Overview==
* Design primers
* Prepare template
* Prepare PCR mix
* Run PCR cycler program
* Analyse by gel electrophoresis

==Designing primers==
Designing suitable primers might be the most crucial step in PCR.  This is especially true when using genomic DNA as the template. Traditionally, primers were designed using empirical guidelines. Nowadays, various pieces of software help to predict the best primers including algorithms to prevent mispriming, self-complementarity and primer-primer complementarity, and binding in repeat regions. Additionally, software programs automate the use empirical guidelines for primer design.  See [[Designing primers|here]] for more details...

==The general PCR cycle==
# heat template/primer/dNTP/enzyme mix to 95°C for separation of DNA duplexes
# lower the temperature enough for primers to anneal specifically to the template DNA (e.g. 55°C); lowering the temperature too much increases unspecific annealing
# raise temperature to optimal elongation temperature of [[Taq]] or similar DNA polymerase (72-74°C)
# repeat from top 20-35 times; less cycles gives less product, too many cycles increases fraction of incomplete and erroneous products
