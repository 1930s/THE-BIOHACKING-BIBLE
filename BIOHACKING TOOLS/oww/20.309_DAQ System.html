Each lab PC is equipped with a [http://www.ni.com/pdf/manuals/370503k.pdf PCI-MIO-16E-1] data acquisition (DAQ)  card. ([http://www.ni.com National Instruments] renamed the PCI-MIO-16E-1 to PCI6070E.) 

The PCI-MIO-16E-1 is a PCI card that has a single, 12-bit analog to digital converter with a maximum sample rate of 1.25 MHz. A multiplexer selects from among 16 single-ended or 8 differentail input signals. In addition, the card includes an instrumentation amplifier with a programmable gain of 0.5 to 100. The card also supports two 12 bit analog output channels, 8 digital input and output lines, and two 24-bit counter/timers with a maximum clock rate of 20 MHz. 

A 10 meter cable runs from the DAQ card to a [http://www.ni.com/pdf/manuals/321183a.pdf BNC-2090] signal breakout box. The BNC-2090 provides BNC type connectors for each of the DAQ boardâ€™s analog inputs and outputs.
