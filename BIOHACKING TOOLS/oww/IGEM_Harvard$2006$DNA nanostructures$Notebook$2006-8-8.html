==Microcon trials==

Trial 1: 30 {{ul}} folded nanostructures diluted in 360 {{ul}} water and placed in a Microcon YM-50 tube.

* Centrifuged at 14k g for 2.5 min, removed 200+ {{ul}} flow-through, and added 200 {{ul}} water.
* Repeated previous step four more times, placing each flow-through in different 0.5 mL PCR tubes. (Fifth centrifuge step for 3.5 min)
* Centrigued remaining liquid out by turning tube upside down and centrifuging at 1.3k g for 1 min (manual says 1k g for 3 min., so we should've centrifuged longer)
* Vacufuged flow-through to near dryness

Trial 2: 30 {{ul}} folded nanostructures diluted in 160 {{ul}} water (total volume: 200 {{ul}}) and placed in a Microcon YM-50 tube. Centrifuged as follows, removing (and combining) flow-through at given intervals:

* Vacufuged flow-through to near dryness

====Gel analysis====

2% agarose gel with EtBr, both gel and buffer (1x TBE) supplemented to 10 mM {{mgcl2}}. Run at 60V for 1 h.

==Biotinylated c5.0==

* reconstituted the oligos c5.0.8.1-5 and c5.0.9.1-5 (in tubes) to 200uM in EB
* made pre-working stocks c5.0.8 and c5.0.9 
** 2.5uL of each 200uM oligo solution + 7.5uL of dH2O
* made working stocks c5.0 E(b) and c5.0 F(b):

* mixed and folded 8 40uL reactions of each according to usual protocol and with FOLDINGD program
* Microconned all 8x40uL (=320uL) of Eb and Fb:
** spun the 320uL of reaction for 4.5min (190uL of flowthrough obtained)
** removed the flowthrough to separate 1.5mL tube
** added 190uL of H2O to top
** repeated twice more
** spun down once for an additional 1min, without adding extra H2O
** extracted final 30uL by turning reservoir upside down and spinning at 1000g for 1 min
** b/c the amount of "elute" was so low (under 10uL) after this step, despite the flowthrough being 30uL short of the 200uL of liquid that was placed in the top, steps for "spinning to dryness" - though the top membrane never appeared completely dry - were taken as outlined by Microcon:
*** 30uL of H2O were added to the reservoir membrane
*** the reservoir and vial were gently agitated (setting 3 on the Vortex) for 30 seconds
*** reservoir was flipped, placed into the collection tube again, and spun down again at 1000g for 3min

==Microcon of c3.2F, G, H, and I==
* after assessing the success of the Microcon 1-spin method, we've decided to use Microcon tubes to purify the four c3.2 designs given above ([[IGEM:Harvard/2006/Container_Design_3#Working_stocks|working stock table]]).
* diluted each 40uL sample to 200uL and then spin down for 4.5minutes at 14000g
** remove flowthrough to separate 1.5mL tube
** add 170ul of H20 to top
** repeat twice more (ie. three flowthrough fractions)
* flip the reservoir and place in new clean Microncon vial; spin down at 1000g for 1min
** b/c the amount of "elute" was so low (under 10uL) after this step, despite the flowthrough being 30uL short of the 200uL of liquid that was placed in the top, steps for "spinning to dryness" - though the top membrane never appeared completely dry - were taken as outlined by Microcon:
*** 30uL of H2O were added to the reservoir membrane
*** the reservoir and vial were gently agitated (setting 3 on the Vortex) for 30 seconds
*** reservoir was flipped, placed into the collection tube again, and spun down again at 1000g for 3min

* ''we will run the top liquid and the flowthroughs in a Mg2+ 2% agarose gel (ladder, scaffold, 4 top liquids - 10uL of each, 4 flowthroughs - Speedvac for 30 minutes down to ~40uL = 10 lanes)''
