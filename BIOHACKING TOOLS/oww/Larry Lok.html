I am a scientist at the [http://www.molsci.org/ Molecular Sciences Institute] in Berkeley, CA.  You can find more about me on [http://www.molsci.org/Dispatch?action-PersonWidget:15-detail=1 this] page.


I have taken a look at several papers connected with ODE parameter estimation, and written up some [[Media:LokParamEstNotes.pdf | notes]] about them.  Here are the papers themselves, including those that Koichi distributed:
*[[Media:Kikuchi2003.pdf | Kikuchi et al. 2003]]
*[[Media:MolesMendesBanga.pdf | Moles, Mendes, and Banga, 2003]]
*[[Media:ObiYagns.pdf | Kimura et al. 2004]]
*[[Media:RunarssonYao.pdf | Runarsson and Yao 2000]]
*[[Media:Sugimoto2005.pdf | Sugimoto et al. 2005]]


Here is an old [[Media:Optimization_scheme.pdf | write-up]] of a program to find time-varying input that maximizes the sensitivity of the response to a particular model parameter (a reaction rate as we discussed it previously.)  This is the same genetic algorithm-type thing that Ty suggested long ago and which we have been talking about since Ty's simulation results that located such an input function.
