Poet Robert Pinsky said, "The longer I live, the more I see there's something about reciting rhythmical words aloud — it's almost biological — that comforts and enlivens human beings."<br>
Photographer Walker Evans said, "Stare, pry, listen, eavesdrop. Die knowing something. You are not here long."<br>



Not long ago when biology meant<br>
looking and prodding and fixing what’s bent<br>
there were armies of scientists working away<br>
to list what they found<br>
and to know life’s display <br> 
*
But not all was well as they tried to discover<br>
how life could be programmed since some but not other<br>
experiments worked and each person designed<br>
their template for learning <br>
as they were inclined <br>
*
“Share!” said the engineers “and try to remember<br>
that others will use your work only whenever<br>
the tools you develop are standard and simple<br>
think of most screwthreads and<br>
think of the wheel.<br>
*
Maybe in this way life by design <br>
could work out of the box and others will find<br>
lots of interesting ways to build up from the bottom<br>
making useful new parts<br>
then new systems. No problem!”<br>
*
By combining devices in new and fun ways<br>
the biologists builders could spend their workdays<br>
learning what’s out there and making new widgets<br>
to responsibly meet <br>
the needs of our planet<br>
