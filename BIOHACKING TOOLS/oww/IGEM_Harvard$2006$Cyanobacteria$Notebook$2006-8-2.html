==X-S digest of KaiA/B and RFP BioBrick plasmid==
We performed X-S digests of KaiA/B and the RFP BioBrick plasmids. There were 6 digests in total: LC3A KaiA, LC3A KaiB, LC3B KaiA, LC3B KaiB, RFP #3, and RFP #4 (RFP numbers refer to the 4 minipreps we did yesterday).

Reaction:
* 20 µL DNA
* 2.5 µL Buffer 2 (from NEB)
* 0.25 µL BSA (100x)
* 0.5 µL XbaI enzyme
* 0.5 µl SpeI enzyme
* 1.25 µL H2O

Incubate for 2 hours at 37C, heat inactivate for 20 minutes at 80C, hold at 4C.

==Phosphotase treatment of KaiA/B and RFP BioBrick plasmid digestions==
After completing the X-S digests, we added 1 µL alkaline phosphatase to each digestion and incubated for 1 hour at 37C.

'''Update:''' This was a mistake, I wasn't supposed to add phosphatase to KaiA and KaiB. We will redo the KaiA/B digests.

==Reinoculation of PCC 7942 flask from frozen stock==
Our PCC 7942 liquid cultures are now more than 2 weeks old, so we reinoculated a new flask from frozen stock so we have a fresh supply of cyanobacteria.

==Gel purification of KaiA/B and RFP BioBrick plasmid==

We gel-purified KaiA/B and the RFP BioBrick plasmids after digesting them and treating them with phosphotase. Gel image to the left.

==Gel extraction of BioBrick backbone==
We excised the 2kb fragments from lanes 6 and 7 above. They're sitting in the 4C refrigerator waiting to be purified.

==Re-digest of KaiA/B and RFP BioBrick==
We redigested LC3B KaiA and LC3B KaiB with X-S since I mistakenly added phosphatase to our earlier digests. Also, at Nick's request, we digested the RFP BioBrick again, with the intent of purifying the insert (not the backbone).
