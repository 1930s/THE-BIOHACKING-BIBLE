===Anything else you would like us to know?===
<i>Optional: As mentioned in lecture on 02.06.07, we would like you to consider how, as a biological engineer you might test the superstition "Spit on a bat before using it for the 1st time to make it lucky." </i> EXP1: have someone spit on the bat.  see if its any more lucky than a regular bat.  give the bat to someone else and see if it stays lucky by this new persons standards. EXP2: tell a person that bat1 is lucky and that bat2 is normal.  both bats are completely the same.  compare their performance.  this would help to see if merely suggesting the bat is lucky makes it lucky.  EXP3: have one bat be spit on and establish that it is lucky by many trials.  then give the lucky bat and a regular bat to someone else and dont tell them anything.  watch their performance and see which one is better. they should be the same kind of bat.
