==Micro fluidic Chip Preparation Protocol==

*Materials:
**Sylgard 184 Silicone Elastomer Base (Dow Corning 3097366-1004)
**Sylgard 184 Silicone Elastomer Curing Agent (Dow Corning 3097358-1004)
**50ml Self-Standing Centrifuge Tube (Corning 430897)
**S/S needle 14G x 1” (Small parts, Inc. NE-142PL-25)
**Cover Glass No.1 22 x 40 mm (Corning Labware)
**ID 0.040”, OD 0.070” Tygon Tubing (Cole-Parmer S-54-HL)
**75% Ethanol
**Argon
**Distilled Water
**PDMS Moulds
**Plasma Cleaner/Sterilizer 
==To make PDMS chips:==
#Pour Elastomer Base in tube (not more than 40 ml)
#Add Elastomer Curing Agent 1:5 ratio to Base.
#Mix thoroughly (use inoculating loops and invert and roll tube) till uniform.
#Place in vacuum chamber for at least 30 minutes or until mixture is degassed.
#Pour into mould and place in oven at 75 C till it hardens
#Remove from mould and cut out chips using blades.
#Poke holes using needle, do not rotate needle to avoid tearing
#Apply scotch tape to remove dust, etc from chips
#Place chip in plasma cleaner along with a cover glass.
#Turn on pump and seal the cleaner chamber.
#Set the RF level to high.
#When plasma strikes optimize by twisting black cap on chamber cover.
#Once optimized let it sit for 45 seconds.
#After 45 s remove from chamber and place chip on cover glass and apply even pressure to ensure a good bond.
#Place in oven at 75 C for 12 hours.
#Cut out hoses (7.5” pieces for in flow, 3.5” for out flow) and insert in holes.
#Check for leaks by flowing ethanol through channels.

==Pre-experiment Preparation==
#Flush channels with 5ml 75% Ethanol.
#Flush channels with DI water.
#Dry by flowing argon through channels.
