==Notes==
*The instrument has 2 modes - 'instrument' and 'emulate'.  When it is set to emulate the program does not communicate with the block, and the iCycler will simulate data even if the iCycler block is on.  To switch back to 'instrument', click the icon under the iCycler folder in the Windows start menu.  There is no way to change modes inside the iCycler program.
