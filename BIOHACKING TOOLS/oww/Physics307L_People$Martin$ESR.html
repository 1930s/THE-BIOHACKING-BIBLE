==Purpose==
The purpose of this experiment is to figure out the <math>g_s\;</math> factor from the spin flip transition of a free electron in a magnetic field.

==Results==

*Above is a graph of the Magnetic field provided by the Helmholtz coils times the Bohr magnetron vs the frequency times Planck's constant.  The slope is the g factor.

Final value for <math>g_s\;</math>: 1.86

Uncertainty in <math>g_s\;</math>: 0.005

Accepted value for <math>g_s\;</math>: 2

Relative error: 7.26%

==How could we improve our experiment==
*Our percent error was about 7% this is not the best experiment we have done all semester but the results were still not bad.
*Since most of our data yields the same result and the uncertainty in our result was small I believe that the main source of error was systematic.  
*If I were to do this experiment again, I would first check all of the equipment to insure that it all worked properly.  This is the only thing that I can think to do to solve this systematic error problem.

==Conclusions==
*Our percent error was about 7% this is not the best experiment we have done all semester but the results were still not bad.
* I learned a lot during the experiment, mostly how to set up that complicated circuit and how to better use an oscilloscope to collect data.  
'''Possible sources of error'''

*Since most of our data yields the same result and the uncertainty in our result was small I believe that the main source of error was systematic.I am thinking bad equipment that might have effected our data.
