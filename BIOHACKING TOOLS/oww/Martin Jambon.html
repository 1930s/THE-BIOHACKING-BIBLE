=== Background ===

* I am currently working for [http://wink.com Wink] - no biology involved
* I used to do some research about bioinformatics and proteins, and was postdoc in the [http://godziklab.org Godzik lab]
* I am the main founder/admin of [http://wikiomics.org Wikiomics], a bioinformatics howto, which opened in November 2005. I don't maintain it myself anymore.
* I made [http://martin.jambon.free.fr/biblio_php.html an extension] of the MediaWiki engine which can retrieve and arrange PMID-based citations in MediaWiki wikis (such as OWW).
* I love [http://caml.inria.fr OCaml] programming. Some say I am a fanatic but of course it's just that they are forever-frustrated programmers. My [http://martin.jambon.free.fr personal web site] provides some utilities for OCaml programmers

=== What I am doing here ===

[[Sri Kosuri]] suggested I join the [[OpenWetWare steering committee]], so here I am. The goal is to join efforts in the world of science/bio wikis and possibly merge [http://wikiomics.org Wikiomics] and OWW.
