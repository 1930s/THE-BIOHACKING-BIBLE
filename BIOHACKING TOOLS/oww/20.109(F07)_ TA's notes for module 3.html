==General notes==
Before term/module begins:
# Check that all links on all wiki pages for biomaterial engineering modulre properly direct to current version of class and to working webpages. Fix broken ones. 
# Dissolve 1.7 g Ir(III)Cl3 in 200 ml ddH20. Do not use IrCl3 from Sigma (cat # 336807) since this is NOT water soluble (oddly). Use only Alfa Aesar IrCl3 (Cat # 11030). Store in dark. <b> note for F07</b> this has already been done. Most all of the materials for the module are in one cabinet in the main lab. Check there first. 
# Confirm pH meter is in good working order.
# Wake up NB273, strain with 3-12 version of M13 in it.Since phage has no selectible marker try to recover by innoculating 2 ml of LB+tet with dab from frozen stock. Tet selects for F' in host strain.<b> note for F07 </b> this has already been piloted and worked well. 
# Wake up Blattner minimal strains on LB plate at 37° ON. These are NB258 through NB263.<b> note for F07 </b> this has already been done. 
# Wake up M13 titering strain, NB271 = ER2267 cat#E4103S. Streak out a plate on LB+Kan so you will have colonies to pick for liquid cultures before phage titration. The Kan is important to select for the F'.
# Pour LB plates (4L), 6 plates per group, x 2 days. Later in the module will need even more, 13 plates/group x 2 days.  
# Pour LB+ Kan plates (2L), 6 plates per group, x 2 days.
# Prepare top agar if needed. TA left over from Mod 1 will still work as long as it's not contaminated. 
# Autoclave more large and small tubes if necessary.
# Check stock of LB liquid media and make more if necessary.
# Reserve TEM for two afternoons it will be needed if this has not been done. Arrange for operator of TEM in you are not certified.<b> note for F07 </b> this has already been done.  
===[[20.109(F07): Growth of phage materials| Notes: Day 1]]===
Before lab:
# Grow phage infected strain NB273, enough for each pair of students to work with at least 3 ml. 
# Check pH meter area for water, waste beaker, standards, Chemwipes, pasteurs, bulbs, pH paper etc.
# Grow NB271= titering strain for M13 in LB+Kan. Grow at least 2.5 ml/lab group.
Day of lab:
# Do not need quiz on day 1 but in future all quizzes 2 or 3 questions, 5 points. 
# Aliquot PEG solution for each group. (500 ul/group in eppendorfs should be enough)
# Fill ice buckets for each group 
# Place rack of 15 ml falcon tubes and foil out for Ir pH'ing.
# Place rack of small sterile test tubes out where all groups can collect as needed. 
# Place 5 ml pipets out near 55° water bath with melted top agar. 
# Place LB plates at RT for titering phage. Need at least 6/lab group. Can leave as piles of plates at front of room where groups can collect as needed.   
# Melt top agar. Need to melt so at least 20 ml of top agar/group. Microwave 1', swirl, microwave 30", and then into 55C water bath to keep molten. It's very important that the top agar be fully melted for the students.
# Place 3 packages of pH paper (1-14) and short pasteur pipets with bulbs at front bench.  
# 3x 1ml 1N NaOH in epp at front bench.

Day after lab: 
# Remove petri dishes from 37° incubator and store at 4° or RT until next time.

===[[20.109(F07): Phage nanowires | Notes: Day 2]]===
Before lab: 
# Prepare 4L+ of 10mM NaOH
Day of lab:
# Need quiz
# Distribute titer plates from Day 1
# Place electropulser on bench with balance. 
# Place cuvettes where students can collect as needed. 
# Place nutator on bench across from balance with foil to cover. 
# Place dialysis tubing, clamps and 6x 40 ml ddH20 in 50 ml falcon tubes on teacher demo area. 

Day after lab: 
# Change 10mM NaOH in dialysis bath.

===[[20.109(F07): Transmission electron microscopy | Notes: Day 3]]===
Before lab:
# 
Day of lab:
# no quiz since students come to lab at staggered times to get to TEM at different times.
# set up bench work area with tweezers, TEM grids, and petri dishes with Western blotting paper. 

===[[20.109 (F07): Phage by design | Notes: Day 4]]===
Before lab:
# Grow Blattner MDS strains, NB258 through NB263, in 2.5 ml LB 37° ON
# Refill EtOH in burners and place EtOH lamps, strikers, jars of EtOH and spreaders on front bench
Day of lab:
# Need quiz.
# <b> 5 hours before lab </b> innoculate 0.5 ml into 4.5 ml LB of NB259 through NB263 and place on roller drum 37°. <b> Please set up 2x NB263</b>
# <b> 2.5 hours before lab </b> innoculate <b> 8x </b> 0.5 ml of NB258 into 4.5 ml LB and place on roller drum 37°
# just before lab, fill ice buckets for all student benches. 
# aliquot 3 ml TB into 15 ml falcon tubes x6 (one aliquot/group)
# aliquot 3x 0.5 ml DMSO into eppendorf tubes for front bench. 
# need 6 LB+Kan plates/group. 
# aliquot M13K07 plasmid into 3x 20 ul eppendorfs for front bench in ice bucket or cold block.
# thaw whatever M13.1 plasmids are available to study and leave on front bench in ice bucket or cold block. 
# aliquot 3x 50 ul Kanamycin and leave on front bench in ice bucket or cold block.
# aliquot 6x 12 ml LB into falcon tubes and leave on front bench. 
# bring full rack of sterile large tubes to front bench.

At end of lab: 
# move tube with LB+Kan to 4° until needed tomorrow.

Day after lab: 
# Remove plates from incubator and blow plug into LB+Kan. Grow on roller wheel 37° ON.

===[[20.109(F07): Phage by design, pt2 | Notes: Day 5]]===

==Recipes/Reagents==
===Growth media===
# LB: 10 g Tryptone, 5 g Yeast Extract, 10 g NaCl per liter. 20g of Agar for plates. Autoclave 30 minutes with stirbar. Pour when ~55°. Let plates dry ON on bench and store in sleeves in 4°. For LB-Kan plates, add the Kan after autoclaving, once the mixture has cooled down to a temperature where you can hold your hands on the flask and not feel like you're being burned. 
# Top Agar: 10 g Tryptone, 5 g Yeast Extract, 10 g NaCl, 1 g MgCl2*6H20 7 g Agar per liter. Autoclave then aliquot to 50 ml conical tubes or bottles. Store at RT. Melt in microwave in beaker of water, 2’ then keep molten in 55° water bath.
# Kan: 25 mg/ml in H20. Filter and store at 4°. Use at 1:1000 in liq media. 2ml/L in plates.
# Tet: 20 mg/ml MeOH. Keep in dark at 4°. Use at 1:1000 in liq media. 1ml/L in plates
# 20% PEG-8000/2.5M NaCl (salt dissolved in PEG solution) Store at 4°.

===Inoue TB===
# Used for making Blattner strains competent.
# 10 mM Pipes, 55 mM MnCl2, 15 mM CaCl2, 250 mM KCl. 
# All the components except the MnCl2 were mixed and the pH adjusted to 6.7 with KOH then MgCl2 was dissolved and the solution was filter sterilized. 
# For Fall of 2007 we have 1L in lab already.
