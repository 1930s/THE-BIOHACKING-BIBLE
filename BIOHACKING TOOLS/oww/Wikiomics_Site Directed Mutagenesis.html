The idea here is to create a flow of work to simulate the point mutation of a single amino acid in a protein. 

#First step is to choose your target.  (This is up to you). 
#Finding the nucleic sequence ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi ENTREZ])
#What type of mutation will be introduced ? (substitution / deletion / addition) 
#Can we find the wanted mutation in other related proteins ? (Blast)
#How conserved is the protein we wish to mutate ?
#Does the w.t. protein has a known 3D structure ?  (Check [http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/ PDB]) 
##if not check out [http://speedy.embl-heidelberg.de/gtsp/flowchart2.html  STRUCTURE PREDICTION FLOWCHART]
#What are the known domains inside our protein ? 
## see [[Wikiomics:Searching for 3D functional sites in a protein structure]]
## Where is the Active Site ? ([http://bioinfo2.weizmann.ac.il/~pietro/SARIG/V3/index.html SARIG])
## What is the location of the mutation? (surface / inside the protein) 
#What impact does the mutation have on the protein (no backbone changes yet)
#If the protein is a multiple subunit protein - what are the subunit interaction residues ? (CSU)
