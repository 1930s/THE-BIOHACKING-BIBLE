The prey cells don't flouressce! '''This is a majour problem!!!''' what are we doing about it?

*This data suggests that the prey cells are flourescing however there is no propper controll so the experiment needs to be repeated [http://openwetware.org/wiki/IGEM:Imperial/Results/J37015] I am pretty sure the increaced flourescence is due to the presence of cells not producing GFP. There needs to be a positive controll.

*My experiment yesterday showed that the prey cells '''DO NOT PRODUCE AHL!''' this is a big problem

'''How can we fix this?'''

*'''[[User:TomH|Tom]] 14:10, 26 August 2006 (EDT)''': When I did the initial testing of J37015 I initally got a AHL and flourescence flatline. However, repeating the experiment and missing out the dilution steps from the o/n culture I got [[IGEM:Imperial/Results/J37015#Results|this output]] for AHL (although I forgot to measure J37015 direct flouresence, oops!). The data does show that AHL is being produced.
