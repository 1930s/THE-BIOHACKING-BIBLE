==Technical Writing==
* Clear simple prose not laden with jargon
* lab report is very different from research article
* A lab report (e.g. high school) is a canned experiment written for the teacher who knows the results
* A research article is written for peers and the results aren't known beforehand
* This class, you're writing for peers a research article
* Formulate figures first
** Start from results
** What's important about it?
** 3 bullet points per figure
