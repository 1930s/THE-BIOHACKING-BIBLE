Recently, I have returned to UT Austin to finish my undergraduate degree, continue to work with OpenWetWare, and teach Yoga and Pilates group fitness classes.

I recently finished a 7-month engineering co-op at [http://www.codondevices.com Codon Devices] in Cambridge, MA as a research intern in the Applications group, and volunteered weekends to work in Production --it was that fun!

Currently, I am develping page designs and templates that make OWW more user-friendly (i.e. front page). I am an active member of the [[OpenWetWare:Steering committee|Steering Committee]], and was the interim OpenWetWare [[OpenWetWare:ByLaws#Elected_Positions|Secretary]] until January 2007.
