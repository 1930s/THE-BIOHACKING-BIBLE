=== Second Order Binding (of two things) ===

Givens: 
*A physical interaction between molecules '''A''' and '''B'''.
*A system that contains some initial concentration of molecules '''A''' and '''B''' (<math>A_0</math> and <math>B_0</math>, respectively).

Tasks: 
*Compute the steady state concentrations of free '''A''', free '''B''', and the '''A:B''' complex.

Approach:
*Write differential equation for change in '''A:B''' over time.
<center><math>\frac{d[A:B]}{dt}=+k_{on}*[A]*[B]-k_{off}*[A:B]</math></center>
*Solve equation at steady state (that is, no change in concentration of the A:B complex.
<center><math>0=+k_{on}*[A]*[B]-k_{off}*[A:B]</math></center>
*Solve for <math>K_D</math>, the dissociation constant.
<center>Equation 1: <math>K_D = k_{off}/k_{on} = \frac{[A][B]}{[A:B]}</math></center>
*Note constraints on system due to conservation of mass.
<center>Equation 2: <math>[A_0] = [A] + [A:B]</math></center>
<center>Equation 3: <math>[B_0] = [B] + [A:B]</math></center>
*Note system of three unknowns with three equations (1-3 above)!  Solve for unknowns '''A''', '''B''', and '''A:B''' (takes you through a quadratic).
