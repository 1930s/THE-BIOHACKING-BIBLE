==A project:  faster maturing FPs==

===Assay overview===
P(regulated)-UBP1-[zFP]  (on the chromosome?)<BR>

P(constitutive)-UBIQ-R-xFP
:expression levels must be such that R-xFP doesn't overwhelm clp machinery (ie undetectable in wt, detectable in clpx mutant)

===Tweaking conditions===
Use UBIQ-L-xFP, instead of UBIQ-R-xFP<BR>
Adjust inducer (arabinose?)<BR>
Integrate UBP1, or keep on a plasmid?<BR>
growth rate (temperature, growth media)<BR>
fast shut off of Ubp1 expression to allow for detection... temperature sensitive ubp1??
screen for bright -Ubp1, then re-screen for bight +Ubp1

===Important considerations===
capacity of clp machinery (modulatable? above wt level?)<BR>
detection limit with FACS (other?), visualizing number of molecules that could be degraded<BR>
plasmid used in GFP screens?  cell-to-cell variability?

===Alternate approaches===
clp mutants<BR>
a variety of degradation tags: ssrA, n-term R, n-term L, RpoS, RepA, HemA, LacI
:used in combination?

===Test case===
Compare in assay, two extant FPs (preferably yellow) that have been shown to have different maturation kinetics (approx 2 fold).

===Expected distributions===
fraction matured, and observed for various maturation rates and degradation rates<br>
multiple processes/rates to reach degradable state

===Thoughts===
