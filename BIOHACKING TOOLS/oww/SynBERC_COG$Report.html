=Notes from retreat=
'''[[User:Jason R. Kelly|Jason R. Kelly]] 09:27, 18 September 2007 (EDT)''': These are just my notes, please feel free to add.
*Should consider distributed vs. centralized approach
**QIAcube could be backbone for distributed approach
*folks would like to see the comparison between projected synthesis costs and assembly going forward 5 years.
*synthesis companies haven't been receptive to making combinatorial libraries of pre-existing components
*in proposing path forward should consider options ranging like NSF grants, VCs, partnering with synth companies, partnering with equip manufacturers (qiacube), etc.
**There was suggestion that if we had a guaranteed order size, we could possible convince synth companies to add a pipeline for assembly.  so could work to get a larger group together.
*Good to continue working on both process optimization issues (e.g. work going on at Registry) as well as alternative assembly approaches that are still "in the lab".
*We need estimates of how much SynBERCers currently clone and how that would scale given drops in assembly cost and turn-around time

=To do=
How do we evaluate the different approaches to automated construction?

#Decentralized approach
#*We make cloning easier by using some automation combined with "normal" individual cloning approaches.  For example, each lab buys a Qiacube to partially automate minipreps and restriction digests.  Then ligations and transformations are done by hand at the bench.
#Centralized academic facility
#*We find the resources to start an assembly facility similar to how sequencing facilities are set up on campus
#Partnership with DNA synthesis company
#*We work with a DNA synthesis company so that they can offer commercial automated cloning services.  How do we ensure that such a partnership wouldn't fall apart as soon as a big synthesis order comes along?  Automated cloning may be too small a market and/or too large a problem for DNA synthesis companies to tackle right now?
