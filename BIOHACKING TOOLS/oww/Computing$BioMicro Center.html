==Intro==
The BioMicro Centerâ€™s computing mission is to support a core set of bioinformatics
applications and also to provide advanced computational, data storage, data security and
data backup services. From [http://biomicro.mit.edu/ BioMicro Center home page].  See also [https://biowiki.mit.edu/biowiki/index.php/General_Help_Page_for_DNA-Net_Users General Help Page for DNA-NET Users].

==Accounts==
DNA-NET domain accounts give users access to storage on centrally managed fileservers. Data stored on these servers can be access from multiple operating systems. To get a DNA-NET account, send email to '''biosupport 'at' mit.edu''' with subject "new user" and the following information:
*First/last name:
*Athena username:
*Lab PI:
*Department:
*Room number/address:
*Phone number:
You can check the status of your request at the [https://bmc-115.mit.edu/support-center BioMicro Support Center]
You will receive a confirmation email when your account is created.

You must login for the first time using a Windows machine. Your username is your Athena username and your temporary password is your username.
Your password must be changed on first login to a different password. This should be your
Athena password, for uniformity.

==Access==
In addition to the [[Endy:Data_storage#Bionet|Bionet]] storage, more space is available on [[Endy:Data_storage#R200|R200]] (which is physically located in [http://whereis.mit.edu/map-jpg?mapterms=w91&mapsearch=go building W91]). To connect, follow procedure below but substitute the address (<tt>192.168.4.28\endy</tt>).

===In Windows===
Drive <tt>X:</tt> is mapped to your home directory at <tt>\\bionet\endy\homedirs\username</tt><br/>
You may want to map drive <tt>Z:</tt> to <tt>\\bionet\endy</tt> to get easy access to the top level of the file share hierarchy:
*Right click My Computer
*Map network drive:
*Pick a drive letter: example <tt>Z:</tt>
*Folder: <tt>\\bionet\endy</tt> (or use IP address: <tt>192.168.4.25\endy</tt>)

===In OS X===
Press <tt>Cmd+K</tt> in Finder to connect to server. Then type in: <tt>cifs:\\bionet\endy</tt>

===In Linux===
Create a mount point:
 # mkdir /mnt/bionet
Add the following line into <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>:
 bionet:/vol/vol0/endy   /mnt/bionet     nfs     rsize=32768,wsize=32768,hard,intr 0 0
Mount the file share:
 # mount /mnt/bionet

===Off campus===
#Download and install VPN client for your operating system from [http://mit.edu/software/ MIT Software Distribution]
#Establish a VPN connection to MIT
#Access the lab file share:
#*Windows: type <tt>\\bionet.mit.edu\endy</tt> (or use IP address: <tt>18.79.1.147\endy</tt>)
#*OS X: press <tt>Cmd+K</tt> in Finder to connect to server. Then type in: <tt>cifs:\\bionet.mit.edu\endy</tt>
#*Linux: follow instructions above (substitute <tt>bionet:/vol/vol0/endy</tt> for <tt>bionet.mit.edu:/vol/vol0/endy</tt>)

Windows users may also be able to join the DNA-NET domain from off-campus. In this case your local username may be not the same as your DNA-NET credentials:
*select: connect using a different username.
*enter you DNA-NET username as follows: <tt>yourusername@dna-net.mit.edu</tt>
*your DNA-NET password

==Description of folder structure==
*<tt>admin</tt> - administrative documents
*<tt>backups</tt> - backups of shmoo, model and habanero
*<tt>projects</tt> - 
*<tt>homedirs</tt> - home directories of lab members
*<tt>.snapshot</tt> - an archive of the whole network file share:
**<tt>weekly</tt> - last week
**<tt>daily</tt> - last two days
**<tt>hourly</tt> - last two hours

==Miscellaneous==
Storage quota for the lab as of June 9, 2005 is 100GB.

Joining DNA-NET domain:
*Need to have a working domain user account
*Use <tt>dna-net.mit.edu</tt> as domain name when joining

Local Administrators can install software locally. Automatic updates through MIT SUS (Software Update Services) server.

Domain controllers:<br/>
<tt>bmc-win2kdc1.dna-net.mit.edu</tt><br/>

DNS and NAT on Bionet:<br/>
Neither bionet nor nearstore have NAT entries on the Cisco.  The MIT addresses are really
MIT addresses.  They also just happen to have interfaces configured on 192.168.4/24 and 10/8 [for the clusters].  Cisco does some magic when you ask it to resolve hosts for which it has a NAT entry.  It actually intercepts the incoming DNS reply and re-writes the answer with the internal IP. - from Michael Vezza

Troubleshooting:<br/>
Tip from Michael Vezza: we use bionet's internal IP address for NFS mounts inside the firewall on all hosts.  A simple entry in /etc/hosts should do.
 192.168.4.25    bionet.mit.edu     bionet
 192.168.4.27    nearstore.mit.edu  nearstore
