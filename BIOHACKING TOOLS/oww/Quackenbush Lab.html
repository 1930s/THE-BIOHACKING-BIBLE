Genomics has revolutionized biology, but not in the ways that many of us initially envisioned. While the reference genome sequences and the catalogues of genes that genome projects have provided are useful starting points for understanding the basis for development and disease, the tools and technology spawned by the genome project have had a far greater impact. Our group focuses on the application of functional genomics techniques – including microarrays, proteomics, metabolomics, and other high-throughput approaches – and the development of computational approaches in support of these studies to develop a comprehensive view of human diseases including cancer. Our goal is to develop software, databases, and bioinformatics techniques that will allow the development of new diagnostics and a more complete understanding of the cellular networks that are mechanistically responsible for diseases. Our commitment is to make those tools widely and freely available to the research community to enable research beyond our own.
