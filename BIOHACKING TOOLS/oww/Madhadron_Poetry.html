A blooming linden<br>
scents my nightly walk homeward --<br>
a quiet pleasure.<br>
(Oberlin, OH; June 29, 2005)

===Four Visions===
====Spring====
Everyone's inside in this April shower<br>
but me, in a loge in the cathedral square,<br>
where the rain veils door and tower and stair,<br>
and goes pat-a-pat, pat-a-pat on the cobbles.<br>

An umbrella bobs around the corner<br>
and --- brown-skirted, tall, and plain ---<br>
my love peers at me through the rain,<br>
and smiles hesitantly --- is she welcome?<br>

She slides onto my lap at my answering smile<br>
and lifts her feet from the rain-runneled tile.<br>
She kisses me, and in my ear,<br>
she murmurs, "'Allo, 'allo, my dear."<br>

====Summer====
I recline on a hilltop one bright summer's day<br>
next to my love, brown and tall,<br>
who gazes down on roof and wall<br>
of a city of brick not far away.<br>

The smell of cyprus, sharp and broad,<br>
the line of her body, the fall of her hair ---<br>
and faintly I catch its scent on the air:<br>
less pungent than cyprus, but sweeter than grass.<br>

I touch it --- and she does not turn ---<br>
but in the way her shoulders lie,<br>
I clearly see her crinkling eye,<br>
and calm, indulgent smile.<br>

====Autumn====
Through the doors I can see the sky --<br>
I'll abandon my work and go outside<br>
to autumn's color up the mountainside<br>
and the terraced garden down below.<br>

On the porch I watch my love<br>
laughing at each pull and shove<br>
in mock battle with the dog<br>
over an old and well chewed log.<br>

The dog gains the stick, proud of his win.<br>
My love gives me a sidelong glance and grin:<br>
Silly, why so long within<br>
On this lovely day?  Come play!<br>

====Winter====
The mountainside is white with snow,<br>
The limbs of oak trees grey and stark.<br>
The black and silver clouds loom low<br>
and wipe the scene of shape and mark.<br>

As I lie on the couch and gaze into the flames<br>
I can hear the north wind as it beats at the door.<br>
From the kitchen comes rustling, a creak of the floor,<br>
then a clinking beside me, a touch on my arm.<br>

My love, in brown, appears beside me,<br>
And cuddling close, proffers some tea.<br>
She cradles her own and peers through the steam,<br>
and secretly smiles, lost in a dream.<br>

===Rain===
The rain is a curtain,<br>
the lightning flashes above,<br>
the people cower<br>
in shop awnings and subways.<br>
This is New York in the rain.<br>

On sixty first street<br>
a cop is parked and reading<br>
while the rain runs down<br>
all the windows of his car<br>
all the buildings on the street.<br>

On the 1 downtown<br>
I faced a girl hardly mussed:<br>
her shoes, a bit damp;<br>
her hair, a few strands displaced;<br>
her mood, reflecting the rain.<br>

Once again at home<br>
I watch the East River bridge<br>
below my window<br>
vanishing in a distance<br>
of thick, silver rain and mist.<br>

===Shitting in the Woods===
To shit in the woods could be hell I suppose.<br>
Impaction, diarrhea, are terrible woes.<br>
And if some right moron mistakes poison ivy --<br>
Oh, how little pleasure that moron now knows!<br>

Eat well, and take your plastic shovel,<br>
Your toilet paper, but leave your troubles...<br>

The golden air at sunset spills upon the ridge<br>
and slowly drowns the in molten light the valley spread below.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I sit, upon my hole.<br>

The treetops' summer foliage is tossed upon the breeze<br>
and dapples all the ferns below into a sea of green.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I crouch, by a log.<br>

Sublimity and silence!  Solitude and bliss!<br>
When I return once more to town, it's surely this I'll miss.<br>
