== Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting: ==

=== Day 1 ===
# Prepare lysis buffer and keep it in ice
#*Lysis Buffer (Non-strigent example):

|-
|2M Tris/Hcl (ph7.5) || 375 ul
|-
|5M NaCl || 375 ul
|-
|Triton X-100 || 150 ul
|-

|100 mM PMSF || 150 ul
|-
|10 mg/ml Leupeptin || 15 ul

#3X wash cells with ice-cold PBS
#lyse the cells with lysis buffer, 200 ÔÅ≠l for each 10 cm2 area confluent cells, scrape the cell debris using the blunt end of the pipette tips, collect the cell lysis and kept in ice.
#centrifuge top speed in 4oC micro-centrifuger for 10 min
#transfer supernatant to new tubes
#measure the protein concentration
#*1:4 mixture of protein reagent: water
#*Take out 5 ul out from 1 ug/ul BSA and cell lysis samples, read the absorbance by photospectrometer and calculate the protein concentration of lysis samples.
#Take out 400 ug of protein from each sample, add in 2 ug of antibody, rock for 1 hr in 4oC. 
#add 30 ul of protein A or protein A/G beads to each sample (note: gentle tap and resuspend all the beads), Rock for overnight at 4oC.

=== Day 2 ===

#Prepare resolving Gel (typical 10%), takes 30 min to solidify.
#Prepare Stacking Gel (mostly 5%), add in comb to generate wells. Take 5-10 min to solidify.
#centrifuge the beads for 5 min at 3000 rpm at 4oC. aspirate the supernatant and add in 1ml lysis buffer for each sample.
#repeat step 9 for 2 times, centrifuge the beads for 5 min at 3000 rpm at 4oC. aspirate the supernatant. 
#add in 6X SDS protein loading buffer to each sample
