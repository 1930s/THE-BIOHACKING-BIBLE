<[[20.20: Design features]] <br>


<font color = red> This site is a work zone. </font color> Eventually we hope to offer an array of animations with comic characters Systems Sally and Device Dude (and Buddy, of course) describing foundational ideas in synthetic biology. The site is started at [http://biobuilder.org/ Biobuilder] 

==List your topic ideas here==
<font color = red> All topic ideas are sincerely welcomed!! </font color><br>
