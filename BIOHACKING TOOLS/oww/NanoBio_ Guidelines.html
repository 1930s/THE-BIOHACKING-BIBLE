==Guidelines on Talking or Writing about your Research Project==
===Structure===
# Briefly introduce, in a sentence or two, what it is you're aiming to do and why it is a valuable thing to do. People frequently refer to this as 'the big picture.'
# Introduce what has been done, focusing on both the state of the art (the best out there) and also areas of research that are most closely related to what you're doing.
# Explain the core elements of what you're doing, and how it is different, an improvement, and/or an advance over what has been previously been done.
