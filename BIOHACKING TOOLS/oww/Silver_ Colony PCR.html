== Zymolyase Solution: ==
*Regular stock of zymolyase is 10 mg/ml diluted in water, mix by inverting, not all will go into solution (filter it) store aliquots at -20&deg;C (minimize freeze-thawing if possible)
*Make 2.5 mg/ml zymolyase solution in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.5 immediately before PCR experiment

== Lysis of Yeast: ==
*Aliquot 15 µl 2.5 mg/ml zymo solution (in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.5) into thin-walled PCR tubes
*Scrape small amount of yeast colony and resuspend in PCR tube (one lysis reaction when dilute will yield ~15 PCR reactions, only 5 µl is used for a template in each PCR re action)
*Incubate on bench (RT) for 20 min
*Place in PCR block and heat to 37&deg;C for 5 min and then 95&deg;C for 5 min

== PCR Step: ==
* Dilute the lysis solution 1:5 by adding 60 ul ddH<sub>2</sub>O to each PCR tube
* Place 5 ul of this dilution into a fresh PCR tube
* Add PCR mix (usually 45 ul total per reaction):
**	2.5 µl     5’ Primer (10 µM)
**  	2.5 µl     3’ Primer (10 µM)
**	5 µl	  Thermopol Buffer
**	1 µl	  dNTPs (10 uM)
**	33.5 µl   ddH<sub>2</sub>O	
**	0.5 µl	  AmpliTaq or Vent DNA Polymerase
*Run Lyse Program (LysAn50), takes about 5 hours

*Check product by running 10 µl PCR sample + 2 µl 6x DNA dye on 1% agarose gel
