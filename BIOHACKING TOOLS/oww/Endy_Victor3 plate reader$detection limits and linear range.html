==Absorbance measurements==

For the OD600 label, the machine appears to respond in a linear fashion over the range of absorbances shown in this figure.  More details of the experiment can be found here.  Better data over a larger range will follow shortly.

==Fluorescence measurements==
Recent experiments have raised the question of what range of concentrations can we expect the plate reader to give linear results.  Chris Quinlan ([http://www.perkinelmer.com of Perkin Elmer]) provided the following information about the plate reader's detection limits.

*Fluorescein MDL (Minimum detectable level) - 2fMoles/well.  Using 200<math>\mu</math>l per well this corresponds to 10pM.

*([http://www.perkinelmer.com Perkin Elmer]) believe the machine has a five decade linear range.  This means concentrations up to <math>\mu</math>Molar should be read linearly.

*For higher concentrations, use a smaller volume.

*The emission of Fluorescein relative to GFP is not yet known.  We also do not know how the emission of purified fluorophores relates to the emission of fluorophores ''in vivo''.

*More to follow on this hopefully.
