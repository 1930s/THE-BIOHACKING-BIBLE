'''Pptase inhibitor protocol'''

#	Freeze cell pellets in liquid nitrogen & Store –80°C
#	Thaw cell pellets on ice
#	Add 500 ul ice-cold virgin lysis buffer and transfer to Bell lab notched screw-top tubes. Then add 500 ul glass beads.
#	Bead beat at 4 degrees by doing the following:
## Use Fast prep machine in the Bell Lab
##	Balance machine with even number of tubes.
##	Rotate starfish guard so it holds tube in place. Tighten with key.
##	Speed: 6.5; Time: 45
#	Once beating is finished, put tubes on ice. It is VERY important to keep tubes on ice from here on out, as the proteases will digest your proteins.
# Invert tubes, and tap tubes to beads move to lid region.
# Poke one hole in the bottom of each tube with hot 21G needle.
## To do this, heat the needle in a bunsen burner between pokes.
#	Place tubes, hole side down, in plastic tubes (from Bell lab). Keep on ice, and move quickly to the next step.
#	Spin 5 min at 3000 rpm at 4° to pellet debris. Use the swinging bucket centrifuge in the centrifuge room.
#	Recover lysate (the liquid in the tube). Discard the screw-top tube. KEEP ON ICE!
#      Split lysate into 50 µL aliquots in Epindorf tubes. Keep on ice!
#	Add the appropriate amounts of pptase and/or pptase inhibitor to each aliquot. See sheet that Samantha sent you for samples to run. See below for the appropriate amounts of pptase or pptase inhibitor to add.
##	1.5 µL Pptase (Calf intestinal Phosphatase)
##	22.5 µL pptase inhibitor (see below)
#	Incubate all samples at 37 °C for one hour.
#	Add 50 µL of 2x sample buffer.
#	Boil for 10 minutes.
#	Load on gel.
