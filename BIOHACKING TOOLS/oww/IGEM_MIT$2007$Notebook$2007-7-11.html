===Agenda===
:1.) Miniprep Backbone LC, DD eRFP (+, - controls), DD miniprep backbone (do we need to gel or pcr purify?), Standard assembly by running gel, purifying gel, ligation, transformation
:2.) Make LC of MerPR and MerR Plates
:3.) Send final transformation miniprep for sequencing

===Diluted LC's of Transformed XL-1===
*Used Samples #3 and #4 from overnight LC's
*Overnight LC's are colonies picked from source plate: 7/9 XL1-blue transformed with pSB3K3+F2620+B0034, 20µL of culture plated on LB+Kan
*1:5 dilution: therefore, we now have 25µl for each cell line
**JH: Accidentally diluted line #3 6X (30µL total).  Line #4 is still 5X dilution.
*Placed in 37C around 10am

===Notes on Future Use of Transformed XL-1===
*Miniprep
:*Some for sequencing
:*standard assembly with eRFP
:*Save some for standard assembly with sticky insert
:*Run a diagnostic digest (use EcoRI and PstI to digest, check length by running gel)
*Permanent glycerol stock (2ml for 2 stocks)

===DD part E1010===
*Digested with EcoRI and SpeI
*Used 121.5 ng/µL eppendorf of E1010
*Mixture:
**8.23µL of DNA
**5µL of EcoRI Buffer
**2µL of EcoRI
**2µL of SpeI
**0.5µL of BSA
**32.27µL of H2O
*3 Hrs in 37C room.  Put in at 11:50AM

*Redid digestion later, needed to use XBaI and PstI rest. enzymes

===Made More 1% Agarose in TAE Buffer===
*1L flask contains: 1L of TAE Buffer and 10 mg of agarose powder each
*TAE buffer can be found above the sink
*Agarose powder can be found on chemical powder shelf rm 558e.  Containers are alphabetized.
*Flask kept in the 55C box next to Jason's bay.
