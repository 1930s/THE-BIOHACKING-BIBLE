==transformation==
lacZa-plx009 gel rescue, lacZa, lacZa-pcc009 precipitation rescue, plx009 and lacZa precipitation rescue

==CD2-T sequencing result==
wrong! We have to re-PCR CD2

==RD2-T sequencing result==
It showed that 1 and 5 colony is right, miniprep using Kit

==Miniprep of T1-T10==
SacII and BSA, T buffer to digest the plasmid to see if it is right

==Miniprep of plx007 1-6 and plx008 1-6==
XhoI cannot cut it. We have to reconsider our testing plan

==Plasmid isolation using Kit==
RD2-pGEMT is isolated and digested with PstI and H buffer
It is all right and send to storage.

==CD2-pGEMT, lacZa-plx009 colony PCR==
The band seems in wrong place. RePCR tomorrow.

==PCR T1TE and T1T2==
rescue by cuting the gel after electrophoresis.
