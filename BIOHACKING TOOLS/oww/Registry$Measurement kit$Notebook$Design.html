Design considerations for the expression measurement kit

==Promoter==
*Constituitive?
*Relative strength
*Location of transcription initiation (outside of or within the promoter?)
*Previous work

==Ribosome Binding Site==
*Relative Strength
*Previous work (<bbpart>B0032</bbpart>)

==Fluorescent Protein==
*Color?
*previous work (<bbpart>E0040</bbpart>)
*Tagged?

==Terminator==
*Do we need one?
*Which one?
*Previous work (<bbpart>B0015</bbpart>)


==Preliminary Proposed Kit Designs==
===Promoter tester with GFP===
*E0240 (pSB1A2)
===Promoter tester with RFP===
*B0032 (pSB1A2) + J04650 (pSB1AK3)
===RBS tester with GFP===
*R0040 (pSB1A2) + I13401 (pSB1A2)
===RBS tester with RFP===
*R0040 (pSB1A2) + J04650 (pSB1AK3)

==Internal labels==
*1 - <bbpart>E0240</bbpart>
*2 - <bbpart>R0040</bbpart>
*3 - <bbpart>I13401</bbpart>
*4 - <bbpart>J04650</bbpart>
*5 - <bbpart>B0032</bbpart>

==Suggestions from peers==
*Using LacZ with a Miller Assay to measure expression instead of an FP
*3-series plasmid as the final vector (with flanking terminators)
*Ensure appropriate spacing between RBS and coding region

==Workaround for the RBS spacing problem==
*In the RBS tester plasmid, use a standard biobrick site minus the PstI restriction site. [...Promoter - EcoRI - XbaI - SpeI - Reporter gene...]
*To insert a RBS, the user would cut both the kit plasmid and the RBS BioBrick plasmid at SpeI and either XbaI or EcoRI and then perform the necessary ligation.
*To retrieve the RBS from the kit and standardize it, one would cut it at EcoRI and SpeI, and insert it into a standard BioBrick plasmid cut at EcoR1 and Spe1.
