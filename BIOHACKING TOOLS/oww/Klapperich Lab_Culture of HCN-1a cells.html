==Overview==

This protocol outlines the steps for culturing HCN-1a cells.

==Materials==
*T25 culture flasks
*Collagen-GAG solution
*HCN-1a media
**DMEM
**4mM L-glutamine
**1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate
**4.5 g/L glucose
**10% Fetal Bovine Serum
*TrypLE Express
*DMSO

==Procedure==
===Basic Aseptic Technique===
*Sanitize all work surfaces periodically with 10% bleach followed by 70% ethanol. 
*Clean all work surfaces (especially in the biosafety cabinet) with 70% ethanol before use.
*Change or spray gloves with 70% ethanol after they touch any unclean surface.
*Spray gloves with ethanol prior to placing objects in/ removing objects from incubator.  Be sure to fully dry sprayed gloves before putting hands in incubator.  Ethanol can kill the cells.  
*When working with RNA, change gloves at least every 15 minutes.
*Wipe down all objects with 70% ethanol prior to placing in biosafety cabinet or RNA work area.  
===Starting New Cells===
#Coat 4 T25 flasks with collagen-GAG.  Pour small amount of fluid into each flask.  Leave in BSC overnight with UV light on.
#Make a batch of supplemented DMEM as described above.  Adjust pH to 7.35.
#Thaw cells by briefly placing in 37&deg;C water bath.
#Pipette 250 uL of cells into each T25 tissue culture flask.  Add 10 mL media to each flask.
#As soon as cells attach (overnight), remove original media.  Replace with new media.
===Subculturing===
#Remove media. Rinse cells with 10mL PBS.
#Add 3.0 mL of TrypLE Express to flask and observe cells under inverted microscope until cell layer is dispersed (5-15 minutes).
#*Note: To avoid clumping do not agitate cells by hitting or shaking the flask while waiting for cells to detach.  Place flask in incubator at 37&deg;C to facilitate dispersal.
#Add 6.0 to 8.0 mL of media and aspirate cells by gently pipetting.
#Transfer cell suspension to centrifuge tube.  Spin at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes.
#Discard supernatant and resuspend cells in fresh media.  Aliquot suspension to new culture vessels.
#Place T25 flasks in incubator at 37&deg;C, 5% CO2.
===Freezing cells===
#Remove media. Rinse cells with 10mL PBS.
#Add 3.0 mL of TrypLE Express to flask and observe cells under inverted microscope until cell layer is dispersed (5-15 minutes).
#*Note: To avoid clumping do not agitate cells by hitting or shaking the flask while waiting for cells to detach.  Place flask in incubator at 37&deg;C to facilitate dispersal.
#Add 6.0 to 8.0 mL of media and aspirate cells by gently pipetting.
#Transfer cell suspension to centrifuge tube.  Remove 20uL from tube and set aside. 
#Spin at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes.
#Count cells from 20 uL sample by adding Trypan Blue and viewing on hematocytometer.
#*Multiply average count by 200,000 to get numbers of cells in pellet.
#Prepare enough freezing media to dilute cells to 1E6 cells/mL.
#*75% DMEM with L-glutamine, dextrose, and sodium bicarbonate
#*20% Fetal Bovine Serum
#*5% DMSO
#Discard supernatant and resuspend cells in freezing media to 1E6 cells/mL.  Vortex to break up pellet.
#Aliquot 1 mL of cell suspension into each cryo-vial.
#Place vials in -80&deg;C freezer in cryo-box lined with a paper towel for 3 hours.
#Move vials to LN2 storage.  Mark location.
