==Understanding Your Training Requirements==

*If you will be doing bench work in the lab please select one of the following to learn about your training requirements:
**I have previously worked in Parsons Lab as a UROP, rotation student, post-doc, technician, graduate student.
**I have previously worked in a different [[department/building at MIT]] as a UROP, rotation student, post-doc, technician, etc. (MIT classes don't count).
**I am [[new to MIT| new to labwork at MIT]].

*If your work in the lab is strictly computational (involves no benchwork) then please see the training requirements for [[Innocent Bystanders]].

*If you do not feel that you fit into any of these categories please see Sean for assistance.
