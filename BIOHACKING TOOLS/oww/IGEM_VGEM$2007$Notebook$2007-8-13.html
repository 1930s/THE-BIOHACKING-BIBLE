==Things to accomplish==
# Order top system/ cellulase system
# Discuss GCMS standards
# Design fermentation experiment

==Things accomplished==
# Evaluate remaining funds
# Continue butanol experiment
## Placed colony from 3.2% butanol plate into 2.4% butanol broth
# Maxi prep construction vectors (A/K, A/C)
# Re-transform failed vector (A/T)
#* Transforming DB3.1 Cells:
## Thaw competent cells on ice.  Place required number of 17 × 100 mm polypropylene tubes on wet ice.
## Gently mix cells, then aliquot 100 µl competent cells into chilled polypropylene tubes.
## Refreeze any unused cells in the dry ice/ethanol bath for 5 minutes before returning them to the -80°C freezer.  Do not use liquid nitrogen.
## Add 5uL of biobrick construction plasmid DNA to cells, moving pipet through cells to mix.  Gently tap to mix.
## Incubate cells on ice for 30 minutes. 
## Heat-shock cells 45 seconds in a 42°C water bath; do not shake.
## Place on ice for 2 minutes.
## Add 0.9 ml of room temperature S.O.C. Medium (Cat. No. 15544-034).
## Shake at 225 rpm (37°C) for 1 hour. 
## Plate transformed cells @ 75uL and 150 uL on ampicillin plates
## Plate control cells @ 100uL on control and ampicillin plates (for a total of 8 plates)
## Incubate overnight at 37°C.
# Finish ''E. coli'' model
