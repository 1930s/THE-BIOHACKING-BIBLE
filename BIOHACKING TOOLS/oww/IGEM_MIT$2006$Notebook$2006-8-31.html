==to do==
#dilute 4 plate reader LCs 1:500 and load w/Barry at 9 am '''-done'''
#glycerol (6) J45399 LCs (note: 2XYT problem) '''-done''' and miniprep '''-done'''
#primers should be arriving today, so we should try to PCR pmsCEAB-full out of PE3 and pE3R (minipreps of both plasmids from 8/29) '''-done/in progress'''
#check if the 0-Q-199A forward sequencing is in from the re-run '''-done''' (it's all good)
#sequence (6) J45399 attempts (b/c similar # of colonies on 2nd attempt I think its worth a try) '''-done'''
#miniprep iGEM yeast shuttle vector '''-done'''
#digest yeast with XS. Also digest our ATF1 biobrick (J45014) with XS. '''NOTE:''' we need to do freeze step so that X and S don't religate for both of these!!
#ligate ATF1 into yeast shuttle vector and transform into yeast (all in one step, hopefully samantha is around)
#pellet big yeast LC with big centrifuge and resuspend cells in milk and find a good bread recipe for baking
#pick colonies from all 8/30 transformant plates and make LCs
#check on pseudomonas '''-done'''

==to do tomorrow==
#analyze the incoming 12 sample sequencing order (and throw out duplicates/bad ones) '''done, also made new LCs for failed sequences'''

==also==
#'''UPDATE REGISTRY''': create registry biobrick parts and choose numbers for our inverter constructs (w/ and w/out osmY attached) '''as well as put all intermediate BGD, IAGD, SAGD parts into the registry!!!!''' - p.s. anybody out of town is welcome to help. we seem to be very behind on this.
