===Direct Magnetic Bead Assay with AIDA1his and AIDA1strep2 cotransformed with RFP sender (08/10/07)===

Protocol: <br>
1) Start cultures of the following:<br>
a) AIDA1strep2 (kan res) cotransformed with sender RFP (amp res,red) in BL21(DE3)<br>
b) AIDAhis (kan res) cotransformed with sender RFP (amp res,red) in BL21(DE3)<br>
c) Background BL21(DE3) transformed with J04500 (kan res,amp res) (white)<br>
<br>
2)At mid log, OD between .4 and .6, induce the following with 1mM IPTG for 2hrs<br>
a) AIDA1strep2 cotransformed with sender RFP (red) in BL21(DE3)<br>
and <br>
b) AIDAhis cotransformed with sender RFP (red) in BL21(DE3)<br>
<br>
3) Equilibrate to similar OD<br>
a) AIDA1strep2 cotransformed with sender RFP (red) (Induced for 2 hrs with 1mM IPTG)<br>
b) AIDAhis cotransformed with sender RFP (red)(Induced for 2 hrs with 1mM IPTG)<br>
and<br>
c) background BL21(DE3) with J04500 (amp/kan resistant)<br>
<br>
OD of all samples was equilibrated to 0.5.  <br>
<br>
Run the following assay<br>
<br>
1) Take 25ul of either Talon or Streptactin beads, put in microcentrifuge tube.<br>
2) Resuspend in 500ul PBS, put on magnet for 2 min, take off supernatent, beads remain.<br>
3) Wash with 700ul PBS (Add PBS, subject to magnet, take of supernatent)<br>
4) add 300ul PBS to a new tube plus 25ul of surface expression cells (either AIDAhis or AIDAstrep2) and 25ul background cells (BL21(DE3) with J04500)<br>
5) incubate 30 min on ice, with gentle shaking every few minutes to facilitate binding of beads<br>
6) put on magnet, let sit 1-2 min, take off supernatent, add 700 ul fresh PBS (repeat this wash step 5 times)<br>
7) resuspend in 500ul LB and plate on LB Kan+Amp<br>
<br>
Also, plate the cell mixture prior to magnetic selection.  <br>
Take:<br>
a) 5ul of AIDAhis cotransformed with sender RFP (red) + 5ul of background BL21(DE3) cells transformed with J04500 (white).<br>
and <br>
b) 5ul of AIDAstrep2 cotransformed with sender RFP (red) + 5ul of background BL21(DE3) cells transformed with J04500 (white).<br>

Also plated 1ul per plate and had >500 colonies on each plate.<br>
On the AIDAhis sender (red) + background BL21(DE3) (white) before magnetic selection 1ul plates there were over 500 colonies, of which >95% were white.<br>
ON the AIDAstrep2 sender (red) + background BL21(DE3) (white) before magnetic selection 1ul plates there were over 500 colonies, almost all of which appear to be white (99%), ~1% red.

Observation:  Assay was successful, and we were able to select for the red colonies (AIDA1-tag + sender RFP) over the white background colonies (BL21DE3 cells with J04500).  Significant enrichment of surface expression bacteria.<br>

Conclusion:  We have a construct that seems to be working well.<br>

===MACS Assay 2 results (08/11/07)===

See [[IGEM:Harvard/2007/Plates|Colony Counts]] for exact numbers of colonies.

Observation:  Assay was successful, and we were able to select for the red colonies over the white background colonies.

Conclusion:  We have a strong construct that seems to be working that we can try to incorporate with the Quorum Sensing group.
