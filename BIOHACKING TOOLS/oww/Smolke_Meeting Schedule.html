===How It Works===
Unless indicated group meeting is at 10:00 am in room 113 Spalding. Research presentations should be on the order of 45-60 minutes. Journal clubs are on the order of 45-60 minutes and are 'presenter's choice' from the list posted on the wiki and contributed to by all lab members. It is the responsibility of the research presenter to obtain the projector from Laura's office (Spalding 224) prior to the start of the meeting. Food is the choice of the member assigned for a particular day but should be 'breakfast type' food such as bagels, donuts, pastries, etc. Note, that the initial SOL ('state of the lab') address will be given by the PI to kick off the research year.
