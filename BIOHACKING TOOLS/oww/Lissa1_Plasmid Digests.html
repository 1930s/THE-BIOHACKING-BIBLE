#	Find prepped plasmid (you purified it out of E. coli using a QIAGEN kit – see protocol for doing that).  
#	Get restriction enzymes.  They are in the -20 freezer.
#	Get buffers from -20 freezer.  You find out which buffers you need form the NEB catalog.  You might also need BSA.
#	Make 30 uL of total digest.  
##	Add 3 uL of the buffer (it’s at 10x concentration).
##	Add BSA (.3 uL, you may need to make a 10x solution and add 3 uL instead)
##	Add 1 uL of enzyme.
##	Add DNA.  We used 2 ug of DNA.  
##	Add water to final volume of 30 uL.
#	Put in thermal cycler.  2 hours for cutting to happen, then look at NEB catalog to find out how long/at what temp to heat for inactivation.
#	Run on small agarose gel with uncut plasmid as a control to check for cutting.  
##	Prepare samples to go in gel.
###	You need blue buffer 1x (2 blues, sorbitol) which is in 4 degree freezer in little tubes (brown tubes, because of light sensitivity).
###	Put equal amounts buffer and DNA on parafilm to load in to gel.  Use 4 uL each.  (You want 200 ng, approximately).  
###	Also use DNA ladder.
