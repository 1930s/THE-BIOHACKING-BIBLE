*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXistenZ EXistenZ (1999, David Cronenberg)]. The all movie turns around a new type of immersive game, where to play, players must plug a 'pod', a bio-organic gaming device, into a 'bio-port' near the bottom of the spine. --[[User:Vincent Rouilly|Vincent]] 15:37, 7 June 2007 (EDT)
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix The matrix] - On Morpheus's ship, they eat gruel that is made of a "single-celled protein".  This makes no sense, since proteins are a component of cells, not vice versa. --[[User:Barry Canton|BC]] 19:26, 7 June 2007 (EDT)
* GATTACA has lots of biotech and society, no biological machines though - K. Handelsman via mail

"I'm a geneticist. I write code.
Like a hacker. Four elements,
A-G-T-P, in different combinations.
Hacking the human genome. I choose
what, I choose where, and your
kidneys work, or you grow a sixth
finger. I do that... You spot
God, lemme know. 'Til then, I'll
trust my Ph.D.s.

But don't get me wrong. Even
without a Great Pumpkin, life's
still great. You gotta seize
it with two hands and live it
large... Which is why I'm not
happy about maybe spending my
last hours on this ugly planet."  D. Endy via mail
