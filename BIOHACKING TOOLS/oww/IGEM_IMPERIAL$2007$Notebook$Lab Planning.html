Outline of week:
*Monday: Preparation of pre-incubation solution and YT media
*Tuesday: Growing of BL21(DE3) in YT media
*Wednesday: Harvesting of BL21(DE3)
*Thursday: Preparation of cell extracts
*Friday: Preparation of cell extracts

Cloning-ligation cycle: 
*Monday: Cloning of plasmids, plating
*Tuesday: Growing up of colonies for mini/midiprep
*Wednesday: Mini/midiprep
*Thursday: (Cloning, plating)
*Friday: Plasmid testing, (Ligation)
[Note: With an optimistic view, on cloning-ligation cycle takes 3 days.]
