<h3><b><i><font color="#ed181e">Escherichia coli</font></i></b></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Theodor Escherich first described <i>E. coli</i> in 1885, as <i>Bacterium
coli commune,</i> which he isolated from the feces of newborns. It was
later renamed <i>Escherichia coli,</i> and for many years the
bacterium was simply considered to be a commensal organism of the large
intestine. It was not until 1935 that a strain of <i>E. coli</i> was
shown to be the cause of an outbreak of diarrhea among infants.<br>
</p>
The GI tract of most warm-blooded animals is colonized by <i>E. coli</i>
within&nbsp; hours or a few days after birth. The bacterium is ingested
in foods or water or obtained directly from other individuals handling
the infant. The human bowel is usually colonized within 40 hours of
birth.
<i>E.
coli</i> can adhere to the mucus overlying the large intestine. Once
established,
an <i>E. coli</i> strain may persist for months or years. Resident
strains
shift over a long period (weeks to months), and more rapidly after
enteric
infection or antimicrobial chemotherapy that perturbs the normal flora.
The basis for these shifts and the ecology of <i>Escherichia coli</i>
in
the intestine of humans are poorly understood despite the vast amount
of
information on almost every other aspect of the organism's existence.
The
entire DNA base sequence of the <i>E. coli</i> genome has been known
since
1997.
<p><i>E. coli</i> is the head of the large bacterial family, <b><i>Enterobacteriaceae</i></b>,
the <b>enteric bacteria</b>, which are facultatively anaerobic
Gram-negative
rods that live in the intestinal tracts of animals in health and
disease.
The <i>Enterobacteriaceae </i>are among the most important bacteria
medically.
A number of genera within the family are human intestinal pathogens
(e.g.
<i>Salmonella</i>,
<i>Shigella</i>,
<i>Yersinia</i>).
Several others are normal colonists of the human gastrointestinal tract
(e.g. <i>Escherichia</i>,
<i>Enterobacter</i>,
<i>Klebsiella</i>), but
these bacteria, as well, may occasionally be associated with diseases
of
humans.
</p>
<p>Physiologically, <i>E. coli</i> is versatile and well-adapted to
its
characteristic habitats. It can grow in media with glucose as the sole
organic constituent. Wild-type <i>E. coli</i> has no growth factor
requirements,
and metabolically it can transform glucose into all of the
macromolecular
components that make up the cell. The bacterium can grow in the
presence
or absence of O<sub>2</sub>. Under anaerobic conditions it will grow by
means of fermentation, producing characteristic "mixed acids and gas"
as
end products. However, it can also grow by means of anaerobic
respiration,
since it is able to utilize NO<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub> or fumarate
as final electron acceptors for respiratory electron transport
processes.
In part, this adapts <i>E. coli</i> to its intestinal (anaerobic) and
its
extraintestinal (aerobic or anaerobic) habitats.
</p>
<p><i>E. coli</i> can respond to environmental signals such as
chemicals,
pH, temperature, osmolarity, etc., in a number of very remarkable ways
considering it is a unicellular organism. For example, it can sense
the
presence or absence of chemicals and gases in its environment and swim
towards or away from them. Or it can stop swimming and grow fimbriae
that
will specifically attach it to a cell or surface receptor. In response
to change in temperature and osmolarity, it can vary the pore diameter
of its outer membrane porins to accommodate larger molecules
(nutrients)
or to exclude inhibitory substances. With its complex mechanisms for
regulation
of metabolism the bacterium can survey the chemical contents in its
environment
in advance of synthesizing any enzymes that metabolize these compounds.
It does not wastefully produce enzymes for degradation of carbon
sources
unless they are available, and it does not produce enzymes for
synthesis
of metabolites if they are available as nutrients in the environment.
</p>
<p><i>E. coli</i> is a consistent inhabitant of the human intestinal
tract,
and it is the <b>predominant facultative organism in the human GI tract</b>;
however, it makes up a very small proportion of the total bacterial
content.
The anaerobic <i>Bacteroides</i> species in the bowel outnumber <i>E.
coli</i>
by at least 20:1. however, the regular presence of <i>E. coli</i> in
the
human intestine and feces has led to tracking the bacterium in nature
as
an indicator of fecal pollution and water contamination. As such, it is
taken to mean that, wherever <i>E. coli</i> is found, there may be
fecal
contamination by intestinal parasites of humans.

</p>
<h3><b><font color="#ed181e"><i>Escherichia coli</i> in the
Gastrointestinal Tract</font></b></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The commensal <i>E. coli</i> strains that inhabit the large
intestine of all humans and warm-blooded animals comprise no more than
1% of
the total&nbsp; bacterial biomass. <br>
</p>
<p>The <i>E. coli</i> flora is apparently in
constant flux. One study on the distribution of different <i>E. coli</i>
strains colonizing the large intestine of women during a one year
period (in a hospital setting) showed that 52.1% yielded one serotype,
34.9% yielded two, 4.4% yielded three, and 0.6% yielded four.&nbsp; The
most likely source of new serotypes of <i>E. coli</i> is acquisition
by the oral route. <br>
</p>
<p>To study oral acquisition, the carriage rate of <i>E.
coli </i>carrying antibiotic-resistance plasmids (R factors) was
examined
among vegetarians, babies, and nonvegetarians. It was assumed that
nonvegetarians might carry more <i>E. coli</i> with R factors due to
their presumed high incidence in animals treated with growth-promoting
antimicrobial agents. However, omnivores had no higher an incidence of
R-factor-containing <i>E. coli</i> than vegetarians, and babies had
more resistant <i>E. coli</i> in their feces than nonvegetarians. No
suitable explanation could be offered for these findings.
Besides, investigation of the microbial flora of the uninhabited
Krakatoa archipelago has shown the presence of antibiotic-resistant <i>E.
coli</i> associated with plants. <br>
</p>
<p>The bottom line seems to be that most of us have more than one
strain
of <span style="font-style: italic;">E. coli</span> in our gut, and
intestinal strains tend to displace one another about three or four
times a year.<br>
</p>
<h3><font color="#ed181e">Pathogenesis of <i>E. coli</i></font></h3>
Over 700 antigenic types (<b>serotypes</b>) of <span
style="font-style: italic;">E. coli</span> are recognized based on <b>O,
H, and K antigens</b>. At one time serotyping was important in
distinguishing
the small number of strains that actually cause disease. Thus, the
serotype O157:H7 (O refers to somatic antigen; H refers to flagellar
antigen) is uniquely responsible for&nbsp; causing HUS (hemolytic
uremic syndrome). Nowadays, particularly for diarrheagenic strains
(those that cause diarrhea) pathogenic <span
style="font-style: italic;">E. coli</span> are classified based on
their unique virulence factors and can only be identified by
these traits. Hence, analysis for pathogenic <i>E. coli</i> usually
requires that the
isolates first be identified as <i>E. coli</i> before testing for
virulence markers.<br>
<br>
Pathogenic strains of <i>E. coli</i> are responsible for three types
of infections in
humans:
<b>urinary
tract infections (UTI)</b>, <b>neonatal meningitis</b>, and
<b>intestinal
diseases (gastroenteritis)</b>. The diseases caused (or not caused) by
a particular strain of <span style="font-style: italic;">E. coli </span>depend
on distribution and expression of an array of virulence determinants,
including adhesins, invasins, toxins, and abilities to withstand host
defenses. These are summarized in Table
1 and applied to the discussion of pathogenic strains <span
style="font-style: italic;">E. coli</span> below.<br>

<h3><font color="#ed181e">Urinary Tract Infections</font></h3>
<b>Uropathogenic <i>E. coli</i></b> <span style="font-weight: bold;">(UPEC)</span>
cause 90% of the urinary tract
infections
(UTI) in anatomically-normal, unobstructed urinary tracts. The bacteria
colonize from the feces or perineal region and ascend the urinary tract
to the bladder. Bladder infections are 14-times more common in females
than males by virtue of the shortened urethra. The typical patient with
uncomplicated cystitis is a sexually-active female who was first
colonized
in the intestine with a uropathogenic <i>E. coli</i> strain. The
organisms
are propelled into the bladder from the periurethral region during
sexual
intercourse. With the aid of specific adhesins they are able to
colonize
the bladder.
<p>The adhesin that has been most closely associated with uropathogenic
<i>E.
coli</i> is the <b>P fimbria</b> (or <b>pyelonephritis-associated
pili
[PAP]</b>). The letter designation is derived from the ability of
P fimbriae to bind specifically to the P blood group antigen which
contains
a D-galactose-D-galactose residue. The fimbriae bind not only to red
cells
but to a specific galactose dissaccharide that is found on the surfaces
uroepithelial cells in approximately 99% of the population.
</p>
<p>The frequency of the distribution of this host cell receptor plays a
role in susceptibility and explains why certain individuals have
repeated
UTI caused by <i>E. coli</i>. Uncomplicated <i>E. coli</i> UTI
virtually
never occurs in individuals lacking the receptors.
</p>
<p>Uropathogenic strains of <i>E. coli</i> possess other determinants
of
virulence in addition to P fimbriae. <i>E. coli</i> with P fimbriae
also
possess the gene for Type 1 fimbriae, and there is evidence that P
fimbriae
are derived from Type 1 fimbriae by insertion of a new fimbrial tip
protein
to replace the mannose-binding domain of Type 1 fimbriae. In any case, <b>Type
1 fimbriae</b> could provide a supplementary mechanism of adherence or
play a role in aggregating the bacteria to a specific
manosyl-glycoprotein
that occurs in urine.
</p>
<p>Uropathogenic strains of <i>E. coli</i> usually produce <b>siderophores</b>
that probably play an essential role in iron acquisition for the
bacteria
during or after colonization. They also produce<span
style="font-weight: bold;"> hemolysins</span> which are
cytotoxic
due to formation of transmembranous pores in host cell membranes. One
strategy
for
obtaining iron and other nutrients for bacterial growth may involve the
lysis of host cells to release these substances. The activity of
hemolysins
is not limited to red cells since the alpha-hemolysins of <i>E. coli</i>
also lyse lymphocytes, and the beta-hemolysins inhibit phagocytosis and
chemotaxis of neutrophils.
</p>
<p>Another factor thought to be involved in the pathogenicity of the
uropathogenic
strains of <i>E. coli</i> is their resistance to the
complement-dependent
bactericidal effect of serum. The presence of K antigens is associated
with upper urinary tract infections, and antibody to the <b>K antigen</b>
has been shown to afford some degree of protection in experimental
infections.
The K antigens of <i>E. coli</i> are "capsular" antigens that may be
composed
of proteinaceous organelles associated with colonization (e.g., CFA
antigens),
or made of polysaccharides. Regardless of their chemistry, these
capsules
may be able to promote bacterial virulence by decreasing the ability of
antibodies and/or complement to bind to the bacterial surface, and the
ability of phagocytes to recognize and engulf the bacterial cells. The
best studied K antigen, K-1, is composed of a polymer of N-acetyl
neuraminic
acid (sialic acid), which besides being antiphagocytic, has the
additional
property of being an antigenic disguise.
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<h3><font color="#ed181e">Neonatal Meningitis</font></h3>
<b>Neonatal meningitis</b> affects 1/2,000-4,000 infants. Eighty
percent
of <i>E. coli</i> strains involved synthesize K-1 capsular antigens
(K-1
is only present 20-40% of the time in intestinal isolates).
<p><i>E. coli</i> strains invade the blood stream of infants from the
nasopharynx
or GI tract and are carried to the meninges.
</p>
<p>The <b>K-1 antigen</b> is considered the major determinant of
virulence
among strains of <i>E. coli</i> that cause neonatal meningitis. K-1 is
a homopolymer of sialic acid. It inhibits phagocytosis, complement, and
responses from the host's immunological mechanisms. K-1 may not be the
only determinant of virulence, however, as <b>siderophore</b>
production
and <b>endotoxin</b> are also likely to be involved.
</p>
<p>Epidemiologic studies have shown that pregnancy is associated with
increased
rates of colonization by K-1 strains and that these strains become
involved
in the subsequent cases of meningitis in the newborn. Probably, the
infant
GI tract is the portal of entry into the bloodstream. Fortunately,
although
colonization is fairly common, invasion and the catastrophic sequelae
are
rare.
</p>
<p>Neonatal meningitis requires antibiotic therapy that usually
includes
ampicillin and a third-generation cephalosporin.
<br>

<b><font color="#18605a"><font size="-1">Lysis of a dividing pair of <i>E.

cells in the presence of a beta-lactam antibiotic. Some beta lactam
antibiotics, such as&nbsp; ampicillin and cephalosporin, are effective
in the treatment of meningitis caused by strains of <i>E. coli</i>
(above). The beta lactam antibiotics prevent cell wall synthesis and
assembly in the bacterium. When the bacterium grows in the presence of
the antibiotic, the cell wall becomes progressively weaker and weaker,
so the the organism eventually ruptures or "lyses", pouring out its
cytoplasmic contents as shown here.</font></font></b> </p>
<h3><font color="#ed181e">Intestinal Diseases Caused by <i>E. coli</i></font></h3>
As a pathogen, <i>E. coli</i> is best known for its
ability
to cause intestinal diseases. Five classes (virotypes) of <i>E. coli</i>
that cause diarrheal diseases are now recognized: <b>enterotoxigenic <i>E.
coli</i> (ETEC), enteroinvasive <i>E. coli</i> (EIEC),
enterohemorrhagic
<i>E.
coli</i> (EHEC), enteropathogenic <i>E. coli</i> (EPEC), and
enteroaggregative
<i>E.
coli</i> (EAEC)</b>. Each class falls within a serological subgroup
and
manifests distinct features in pathogenesis.
A summary of the characteristics of diarrheagenic strains of <span
style="font-style: italic;">E. coli</span> is given in Table 2 at the
end of this article.<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#ed181e">Enterotoxigenic <i>E. coli</i> (ETEC)<br>
</font></b><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">ETEC</span> is an important cause of
diarrhea in infants
and travelers
in underdeveloped countries or regions of poor sanitation. In the U.S.,
it has been implicated in sporadic waterborne
outbreaks, as well as due to the consumption of soft cheeses,
Mexican-style foods and raw
vegetables. The diseases
vary from minor discomfort to a severe cholera-like syndrome. ETEC are
acquired by ingestion of contaminated food and water, and adults in
endemic
areas evidently develop immunity. The disease requires colonization and
elaboration of one or more enterotoxins. Both traits are
plasmid-encoded.<br>
<br>
ETEC may produce a <span style="font-weight: bold;">heat-labile
enterotoxin (LT)</span> that is similar in molecular size,
sequence, antigenicity, and function to the cholera toxin (Ctx). It is
an 86kDa protein composed of an enzymatically active (A) subunit
surrounded by 5 identical binding (B) subunits. It binds to the same
identical
ganglioside receptors that are recognized by the cholera toxin (i.e.,
GM1),
and its enzymatic activity is identical to that of the cholera toxin. <br>
<br>
ETEC may also produce a<span style="font-weight: bold;">
heat stable toxin (ST)</span> that is of low molecular size and
resistant to boiling for 30 minutes.
There are several variants of ST, of which ST1a or STp is found in <span
style="font-style: italic;">E. coli</span> isolated
from both humans and animals, while ST1b or STh is predominant in human
isolates only. The ST enterotoxins are
peptides
of molecular weight about 4,000 daltons. Their small size explains why
they are not inactivated by heat. ST causes an increase in cyclic GMP
in
host cell cytoplasm leading to the same effects as an increase in cAMP.
ST1a
is known to act by binding to a guanylate cyclase that is located on
the
apical membranes of host cells, thereby activating the enzyme. This
leads
to secretion of fluid and electrolytes resulting in diarrhea.<br>
<br>
The
infective dose of ETEC for adults has been estimated to be at least 10<sup>8</sup>
cells; but the
young, the elderly and the infirm may be susceptible to lower numbers.<br>
<p>ETEC adhesins are <span style="font-weight: bold;">fimbriae</span>
which are species-specific. For
example,
the K-88 fimbrial Ag is found on strains from piglets; K-99 Ag is found
on strains from calves and lambs; CFA I, and CFA II, are found on
strains
from humans. These fimbrial adhesins adhere to specific receptors on
enterocytes
of the proximal small intestine.
</p>
Symptoms ETEC infections include <span style="font-weight: bold;">diarrhea
without fever</span>. The
bacteria
colonize the GI tract by means of a fimbrial adhesin, e.g. CFA I and
CFA
II, and are<span style="font-weight: bold;"> noninvasive</span>, but
produce either the LT or ST toxin.
&lt;&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#ed181e">Enteroinvasive <i>E. coli </i>(EIEC)<br>
<br>
</font></b><b>EIEC </b>closely resemble <i>Shigella</i> in their
pathogenic mechanisms
and the kind of clinical illness they produce. EIEC penetrate and
multiply
within epithelial cells of the colon causing widespread cell
destruction.
The clinical syndrome is identical to <i>Shigella</i> dysentery and
includes
a <span style="font-weight: bold;">dysentery-like diarrhea with fever</span>.
EIEC apparently lack fimbrial
adhesins
but do possess a specific adhesin that, as in <i>Shigella</i>, is
thought
to be an outer membrane protein. Also, like<i> Shigella</i>, EIEC
are
<span style="font-weight: bold;">invasive </span>organisms. They do
not produce LT or ST toxin.<br>
<br>
There
are no known animal reservoirs of EIEC. Hence the primary source for
EIEC appears to be infected
humans. Although the infective dose of <em>Shigella</em> is low (in
the range of 10 to few
hundred cells), volunteer feeding studies showed that at least 10<sup>6</sup>
EIEC organisms are
required to cause illness in healthy adults. Unlike typical <i>E. coli</i>,
EIEC are
non-motile, do not decarboxylate lysine and do not ferment lactose.
Pathogenicity of EIEC is primarily due to its ability to invade and
destroy colonic tissue. The
invasion phenotype, encoded by a high molecular weight plasmid, can be
detected by PCR and probes for specific for invasion genes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#ed181e">Enteropathogenic <i>E. coli</i> (EPEC)<br>
<br>
</font></b>EPEC induce a profuse <span style="font-weight: bold;">watery,
sometimes bloody, diarrhea</span>.
They are a leading cause of
infantile diarrhea in developing countries. Outbreaks have been linked
to the
consumption of contaminated drinking water as well as some meat
products.&nbsp; Pathogenesis of EPEC involves<span
style="font-weight: bold;"></span> a plasmid-encoded protein
referred to as <span style="font-weight: bold;">EPEC adherence factor</span>
(<span style="font-weight: bold;">EAF</span>) that enables localized
adherence of bacteria to
intestinal cells and a non fimbrial adhesin designated <span
style="font-weight: bold;">intimin</span>, which is an
outer
membrane protein that mediates the final stages of adherence. They do
not produce ST or LT toxins.<br>
<p>Adherence of EPEC strains to the intestinal mucosa is a very
complicated
process and produces dramatic effects in the ultrastructure of the
cells
resulting in rearrangements of actin in the vicinity of adherent
bacteria.
The phenomenon is sometimes called "attachment and effacing" of
cells.
EPEC strains are said to be "moderately-invasive",&nbsp; meaning they
are
not as invasive as <span style="font-style: italic;">Shigella,</span>
and unlike ETEC or EAEC, they
cause
an inflammatory response. The diarrhea and other symptoms of EPEC
infections
probably are caused by bacterial invasion of host cells and
interference
with normal cellular signal transduction, rather than by production of
toxins.<br>
<br>
Through volunteer
feeding studies the infectious dose of EPEC in healthy adults has been
estimated to be
10<sup>6</sup> organisms.<br>
<br>
Some types of EPEC are referred to as <span style="font-weight: bold;">diffusely
adherent <span style="font-style: italic;">E. coli</span>
(DAEC)</span>, based on specific patterns of adherence. They are an
important
cause of traveler's diarrhea in Mexico and in North Africa.<br>
<br>
</p>
<b><font color="#ed181e">Enteroaggregative <i>E. coli</i> (EAEC)<br>
<br>
</font></b>The distinguishing feature of <b>EAEC</b> strains is
their ability to
attach to tissue culture cells in an aggregative manner. These strains
are associated with persistent diarrhea in young children. They
resemble
ETEC strains in that the bacteria adhere to the intestinal mucosa and
cause
non-bloody diarrhea without invading or causing inflammation. This
suggests
that the organisms produce an enterotoxin of some sort. Recently, a
distinctive
heat-labile plasmid-encoded toxin has been isolated from these strains,
called the <b>EAST</b> (<b>EnteroAggregative ST</b>) <b>toxin</b>.
They
also produce a <b>hemolysin</b> related to the hemolysin produced by <i>E.
coli</i> strains involved in urinary tract infections. The role of the
toxin and the hemolysin in virulence has not been proven. The
significance
of EAEC strains in human disease is controversial.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<b><font color="#ed181e">Enterohemorrhagic
<i>E. coli</i> (EHEC)<br>
<br>
</font></b><b>EHEC</b> are recognized as the primary cause of <span
style="font-weight: bold;">hemorrhagic colitis (HC)</span> or bloody
diarrhea, which can progress to the potentially fatal <span
style="font-weight: bold;">hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)</span>.
EHEC
are characterized by the production of verotoxin or <span
style="font-weight: bold;">Shiga toxins</span> (Stx). Although Stx1
and Stx2
are most often implicated in human illness, several variants of Stx2
exist. <br>
<br>
There are many
serotypes of Stx-producing <i>E. coli</i> , but only those that have
been clinically
associated with HC are designated as EHEC. Of these, <span
style="font-weight: bold;">O157:H7</span> is the prototypic EHEC and
most often implicated in illness worldwide. The infectious dose for
O157:H7 is estimated to be 10
- 100 cells; but no information is available for other EHEC serotypes.
EHEC infections are
mostly food or water borne and have implicated undercooked ground beef,
raw milk, cold sandwiches, water, unpasteurized apple juice and
vegetables<b><br>
</b>
<p>EHEC are
considered
to be "<b>moderately invasive</b>". Nothing is known about the
colonization
antigens of EHEC but <b>fimbriae</b> are presumed to be involved. The
bacteria
do not invade mucosal cells as readily as <i>Shigella</i>, but EHEC
strains
produce a toxin that is virtually identical to the Shiga toxin.
The toxin plays a role in the intense inflammatory response produced by
EHEC strains and may explain the ability of EHEC strains to cause HUS.
The toxin is phage encoded and its production is enhanced by iron
deficiency.</p>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">ETEC</span><br>
fimbrial adhesins e.g. CFA I, CFAII, K88. K99 <br>
non invasive <br>
produce LT and/or ST toxin <br>
watery diarrhea in infants and travelers; no inflammation, no fever
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
<br>
EIEC</span><br>
nonfimbrial adhesins, possibly outer membrane protein <br>
invasive (penetrate and multiply within epithelial cells) <br>
does not produce shiga toxin <br>
dysentery-like diarrhea (mucous, blood), severe inflammation, fever
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">EPEC</span><br>
non fimbrial adhesin (intimin)<br>
EPEC adherence factor (EAF)
enables localized adherence of bacteria to
intestinal cells <br>
moderately invasive (not as invasive as <span
style="font-style: italic;">Shigella</span> or EIEC) <br>
does not produce LT or ST; some reports of shiga-like toxin <br>
usually infantile diarrhea; watery diarrhea with blood, some
inflammation,
no fever; symptoms probably result mainly from invasion rather than
toxigenesis
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">EAEC</span><br>
adhesins not characterized <br>
non invasive <br>
produce ST-like toxin (EAST) and a hemolysin <br>
persistent diarrhea in young children without inflammation or fever
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">EHEC</span><br>
adhesins not characterized, probably fimbriae <br>
moderately invasive <br>
does not produce LT or ST but does produce shiga toxin <br>
pediatric diarrhea, copious bloody discharge (hemorrhagic colitis),
intense inflammatory response, may be complicated by hemolytic uremia
