==Objective==

Taught in the context of biological research, this course helps biologists learn how to use the statistical [http://r-project.org/ scripting language R] for data analysis.  Unlike [[Bioinformatics Organization]] course MA101A (Biostatistics with R, Part 1), this course focuses on the syntax and functionality of the language R and may be used in preparation for MA101A. Armed with some knowledge and hands-on experience with a programming or scripting language, scientists taking a CS101 course at Bioinformatics.Org will be able to perform basic software development tasks and phrase research questions in the context of the language. As a result, they will be able to appreciate and use computers better in their organization and communicate better with their IT group.

==Course outline==

* Day 1: Installing and running R, understanding the R interactive environment
* Day 2: Creating, storing and manipulating R data objects, reading data from files
* Day 3: Applying built-in functions on data. ''for-loops'', ''if-then-else'' statements
* Day 4: Scripts, functions, packages. Introduction to [http://bioconductor.org/ Bioconductor]. Students will be assigned a project.
* Day 5: Project discussion

For an additional USD $49, students who attend this course may order data discs containing full-resolution lecture videos and extra copies of the slides, scripts and data files.

Registration deadline: When full

==Tuition and discounts==

The fee for this course is $595 USD (commercial and government)

Discounted rates are available, as follows:
* Academic and non-profit research organizations, $397 (USD)
* Students paying for themselves (not getting reimbursement) and unemployed individuals (verification required), $198

==Logistics==

Online courses are offered via online meeting system.  Access information will be provided prior to the start of the course. Each lecture will last 45 to 90 minutes, depending on the topics covered.

Students will also be able to communicate with the instructor and other students via the course forums.  Lecture attendance is therefore not required.

Since this will be an interactive, hands-on workshop, all attendees will need a computer with a broadband Internet connection (1 Mbps or faster is strongly recommended for those watching the live lecture), a sound card with speakers, a modern Web browser, and the [http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/ Adobe Flash plugin].  A microphone and webcam is not required for this course.  The necessary software, lecture notes and exercises will be provided.

==Certification==

This course is certified by the [[Bioinformatics Organization|Bioinformatics Organization, Inc.]], the largest international affiliation in the field, and it will count as '''5''' "Continuing Scientific Education" (CSE) credits (one credit per contact hour) within the Organization. Students completing the course will receive a certificate attesting to that.
