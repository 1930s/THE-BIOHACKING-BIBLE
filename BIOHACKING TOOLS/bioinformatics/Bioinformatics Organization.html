Bioinformatics Organization, Inc. is located in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson%2C_Massachusetts Hudson, Massachusetts].

==Mission statement==

''The Bioinformatics Organization, Inc. serves the scientific and educational needs of bioinformatic practitioners and the general public. We develop and maintain computational resources to facilitate world-wide communications and collaborations between people of all educational and professional levels. We provide and promote open access to the materials and methods required for, and derived from, research, development and education.''

==Membership==

The Bioinformatics Organization provides associate (non-voting) membership to individuals. This type of membership is divided into two categories: [[Membership|Basic and Professional]].

Bioinformatics.Org was established in 1998 by [[J.W. Bizzaro]] as a place to [[Hosting|host collaborations]] in [[Bioinformatics|bioinformatics]]. In 2000, the Organization had more than 100 members and a dozen projects. The Organization became incorporated in 2003 and currently has about 25,000 members and over 300 projects. Bioinformatics.Org is now one of the largest affiliations in the field of bioinformatics, and the number of resources that we offer is on-par with the number offered by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ NCBI] and [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ EBI]. However, we distinguish ourselves with our open membership and project hosting: anyone, anywhere can participate. Bioinformatics.Org is also well-known for its emphasis on open access to biological information as well as on [http://www.fsf.org/ Free] and [http://www.opensource.org/ Open Source] software.

==Services==

* Life sciences R&D: The Bioinformatics Organization provides [[Hosting|group hosting services]] and a number of online tools, databases and forums, all free to use.  Through our [[Bioinformatics Core Facility]], we provide fee-based data analysis and software development services to cater to the needs of scientists and biomedical researchers.
* Education: In addition to the hosted resources, which are also available for educational use, the Bioinformatics Organization offers [http://edu.bioinformatics.org/ professional development courses] for continuing scientific education. These are short, graduate- or postgraduate-level courses on computational topics of interest to prospective and practicing researchers in the life sciences.
