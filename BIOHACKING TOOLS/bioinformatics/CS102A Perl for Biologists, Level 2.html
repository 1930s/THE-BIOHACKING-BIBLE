==Objective==

Taught in the context of biological research, this course shows biologists how to use the scripting language Perl to automate certain tasks. It is a continuation of [[CS101A Perl for Biologists, Level 1]] and covers advanced topics and projects.

==Course outline==

* Day 1: Perl basics (a quick review):
*** How to use Perl commands in scripts and functions
*** Good programming practices
*** Specials notes, shortcuts, basic commands you may have forgotten
** Case study: Automating BLAST
*** Downloading sequences and formating them for querying using the “formatdb.exe” program
*** Creating FASTA file with sequences on which to use BLAST
*** Writing a program to call “blastall.exe”, finding the best hits
** Case study: Gene expression analysis
*** Reading ~20000 gene scores in a text file corresponding to 8 samples, and a gene information file
*** Performing thresholding and normalization for this data
*** Calculating fold change, difference, t-statistics, p-value, confidence intervals, etc.
*** Outputing the filtered results, sorted by lower confidence interval, and removing Affymetrix control genes
* Day 2: Creating and using modules, namespaces, packages. References and object-oriented programming
* Day 3: The Perl DBI and DBD for the MySQL DBMS. Using BioPerl for sequence analysis
* Day 4: Project: Microarray database with sequence information
** Use SantaLucia rules to calculate the delta-G value of all 25-mer Perfect Match (PM) probe sequences.
** Create tables in a database using Perl to accommodate the data.
* Day 5: Project discussions

==Registration==

Registration comprises of two steps. First, [https://edu.bioinformatics.org/login/signup.php create an online account] to access the educational section of our website. Second, register for this course by making a payment using either the online registration form (click on the scheduled course above; ''use this form only for credit card payments via secured PayPal''), or by sending in the [http://edu.bioinformatics.org/download/registration_form.pdf mail-in registration form] (~150 kB PDF, ''use this form if paying by US checks, credit card or corporate purchase order''). Please check the tuition rates and discounts below.

For an additional USD $49, students who attend this course may order data discs containing full-resolution lecture videos and extra copies of the slides, scripts and data files.

Registration deadline: When full

==Tuition and discounts==

The fee for this course is $595 USD (commercial and government)

Discounted rates are available, as follows:
* Academic and non-profit research organizations, $397 (USD)
* Students paying for themselves (not getting reimbursement) and unemployed individuals (verification required), $198
* Limited scholarships may also be available
* Professional members get an additional 20% discount

==Logistics==

Online courses are offered via online meeting system.  Access information will be provided prior to the start of the course. Each lecture will last 45 to 90 minutes, depending on the topics covered. For those who cannot attend the lectures at those times, the lectures will be recorded and placed on the course website as Flash videos (resolution reduced by 30%) each day, within one day.  Students will also be able to communicate with the instructor and other students via the course forums.  Lecture attendance is therefore not required.

Since this will be an interactive, hands-on workshop, all attendees will need a computer with a broadband Internet connection (1 Mbps or faster is strongly recommended for those watching the live lecture), a sound card with speakers, a modern Web browser, and the [http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/ Adobe Flash plugin].  A microphone and webcam is not required for this course.  The necessary software, lecture notes and exercises will be provided.

==Certification==

This course is certified by the [[Bioinformatics Organization|Bioinformatics Organization, Inc.]], the largest international affiliation in the field, and it will count as '''5''' "Continuing Scientific Education" (CSE) credits (one credit per contact hour) within the Organization. Students completing the course will receive a certificate attesting to that.
