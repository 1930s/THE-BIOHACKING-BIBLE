==Objective==

Taught in the context of biological research, this course helps biologists learn how to use the [http://www.mysql.com/ database management system, MYSQL] to store, manage and query biological information. Armed with some knowledge and hands-on experience with a database system, scientists taking a CS101 course at the [[Bioinformatics Organization]] will be able to perform basic data storage tasks and phrase research questions in the context of the database. As a result, they will be able to appreciate and use computers better in their organization and communicate better with their IT group. 

No experience is required, although prior experience with any database system (Microsoft Access) will be helpful. This course is certified by the [[Bioinformatics Organization|Bioinformatics Organization, Inc.]], the largest international affiliation in the field, and it will count as '''5''' "Continuing Scientific Education" (CSE) credits (one credit per contact hour) within the Organization. Students completing the course will receive a certificate attesting to that.

==Course outline==

* Day 1: Fundamentals of databases and deciding what to store, and how to install a database
* Day 2: Creating and designing a database. Populating the database with sample data
* Day 3: Data retrieval and manipulation concepts using SQL queries (Select, Update, Delete, Insert)
* Day 4: Additional topics like interfacing the database with the Microsoft Access front end. Mining the data using Perl database interface.
* Day 5: Project discussion

Typical data used to illustrate the concept of databases will be from microarray experiments or sequence operations.

Online courses are offered on the ASAP online meeting system.  Access information will be provided prior to the start of the course. Each lecture will last 45 to 90 minutes, depending on the topics covered. For those who cannot attend the lectures at those times, the lectures will be recorded and placed on the course website as Flash videos (resolution reduced by 30%) each day, within one day.  Students will also be able to communicate with the instructor and other students via the course forums.  Lecture attendance is therefore not required.

Since this will be an interactive, hands-on workshop, all attendees will need a computer with a broadband Internet connection (1 Mbps or faster is strongly recommended for those watching the live lecture), a sound card with speakers, a modern Web browser, and the [http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/ Adobe Flash plugin].
