==Objective==

Taught in the context of biological research, this course helps biologists learn how to use the [http://perl.org/ scripting language Perl] to automate certain tasks. Armed with some knowledge and hands-on experience with a programming or scripting language, scientists taking a CS101 course at the [[Bioinformatics Organization]] will be able to perform basic software development tasks and phrase research questions in the context of the language. As a result, they will be able to appreciate and use computers better in their organization and communicate better with their IT group. 

No experience is required, although prior experience with any other programming language will be helpful. Math skills will also be useful.

==Course outline==

* Day 1: Installing and running simple Perl programs
* Day 2: Variables (scalars, arrays), printing, variable interpolation, string operations
* Day 3: Mathematical, conditional and logical operators, file input/output, loops (''if-then-else'', ''for'', ''while'')
* Day 4: List operations, regular expressions, functions, introduction to [http://bioperl.org/ BioPerl]. Students will be assigned a project.
* Day 5: Project discussion
