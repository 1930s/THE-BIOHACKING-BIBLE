The [[Bioinformatics Organization]] was established as a non-profit institute in 1998, with a mission to provide research, development and educational services to the life sciences community.  Today, the Organization is the largest international affiliation in the field, having tens of thousands of members from around the world.

The Core Facility draws on our wealth of experience in assisting biomedical and pharmaceutical scientists facing computational hurdles in their work. Our scientific staff use state-of-the-art hardware and software, as well as their knowledge, to develop solutions for computational problems. The educational offerings of the facility allow scientists to learn techniques for themselves and to solve problems independently.
