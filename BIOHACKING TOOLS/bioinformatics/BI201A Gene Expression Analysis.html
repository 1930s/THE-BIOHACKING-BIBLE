==Objective==

This course helps to demystify Affymetrix analysis so that any researcher can take the basic steps to go from a chip image to a list of genes that are up- or down-regulated in an experiment. Various tools will be covered, e.g. GCOS, Excel, MATLAB, and free tools like R and Dchip. It is geared towards researchers who conduct microarray experiments to study genome-wide expression changes and understand the underlying mechanisms of gene regulation in samples of interest. Most scientists are not able to analyze the resulting data themselves. They are not able to get desired results using traditional tools like Microsoft Word and Excel, or with advanced software provided by commercial vendors. The freeware solutions come either with a steep learning curve or as black-box interfaces that provide limited functionality with little or no technical support. In the midst of all this is the fundamental lack of understanding among scientists on how the technology works and what the fundamental parts of the analysis are. 

No experience is required, although prior experience with any other programming language will be helpful. Math skills will also be useful. This course is certified by the [[Bioinformatics Organization|Bioinformatics Organization, Inc.]], the largest international affiliation in the field, and it will count as '''10''' "Continuing Scientific Education" (CSE) credits (one credit per contact hour) within the Organization. Students completing the course will receive a certificate attesting to that.

==Course outline==

* Day 1: Introduction to GCOS â€“ the environment, creating and saving experiments, importing and exporting data, normalization settings, from DAT->CEL->CHP->RPT files and their significance, importing and exporting data 
* Day 2: Dchip software: importing expression data and annotation information into Dchip, normalization, gene filtering, clustering, visualization along chromosome, gene ranking by confidence intervals and pvalues for group studies, exporting to Excel. 
* Day 3: R/Bioconductor: installing and configuring bioconductor for gene expression analysis, obtaining normalized gene expression scores, performing statistics to obtaining differentially regulated genes in time series or group studies. 
* Day 4: MATLAB: importing expression data in MATLAB, thresholding, normalization, gene filtering, clustering, classification, statistical gene ranking for time series and group studies, exporting to excel, building custom user interfaces for advanced applications. 
* Day 5: Problem solving session involving some real gene expression data

Online courses are offered on the ASAP online meeting system.  Access information will be provided prior to the start of the course. Each lecture will last 45 to 90 minutes, depending on the topics covered. For those who cannot attend the lectures at those times, the lectures will be recorded and placed on the course website as Flash videos (resolution reduced by 30%) each day, within one day.  Students will also be able to communicate with the instructor and other students via the course forums.  Lecture attendance is therefore not required.

Since this will be an interactive, hands-on workshop, all attendees will need a computer with a broadband Internet connection (1 Mbps or faster is strongly recommended for those watching the live lecture), a sound card with speakers, a modern Web browser, and the [http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/ Adobe Flash plugin].  Please [[ASAP requirements|check the specific system requirements for your computer]].  A microphone and webcam is not required for this course.  The necessary software, lecture notes and exercises will be provided.
