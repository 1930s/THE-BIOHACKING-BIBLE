==Background==

Mitochondria are semi-autonomous organelles, presumed to be the evolutionary product of a symbiosis between a eukaryote and a prokaryote. The organelle is present in almost all eukaryotic cells in an extent from 10^3-10^4 copies. The main function of mitochondria is production of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation and its involvement in apoptosis. The organelles contain almost exclusively maternally inherited mtDNA, and they have specific systems for transcription, translation and replication of mtDNA.

Mitochondrial dysfunction has been correlated with mitochondrial diseases where the clinical pathologies are believed to include infertility, diabetes, blindness, deafness, stroke, migraine and heart-, kidney-, and liver diseases. Recently cancer was added to this list when investigations into human cancer cells from breast, bladder, neck, and lung, revealed a high occurrence of mutations in mtDNA. With the emerging understanding of the role of mitochondria in a vast array of pathologies, research of mitochondria and mitochondrial dysfunction have in the last decade yielded a huge amount of data in form of publications and databases. Nevertheless, the field of mitochondrial research is still far from exhausted with many unknown factors yet to be discovered.

==Objective==

The purpose of this course is to introduce the student to the various databases and wet-lab methods available. Furthermore, the course will, through selected articles, give an understanding of the pitfalls and limitations of the various databases and methods.

Online courses are offered on the ASAP online meeting system.  Access information will be provided prior to the start of the course. Each lecture will last 90 to 180 minutes, depending on the topics covered. For those who cannot attend the lectures at those times, the lectures will be recorded and placed on the course website as Flash videos (resolution reduced by 30%) each day, within one day.  Students will also be able to communicate with the instructor and other students via the course forums.  Lecture attendance is therefore not required.

Since this will be an interactive, hands-on workshop, all attendees will need a computer with a broadband Internet connection (1 Mbps or faster is strongly recommended for those watching the live lecture), a sound card with speakers, a modern Web browser, and the [http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/ Adobe Flash plugin].  Please [[ASAP requirements|check the specific system requirements for your computer]].  A microphone and webcam is not required for this course.  The necessary software, lecture notes and exercises will be provided.
