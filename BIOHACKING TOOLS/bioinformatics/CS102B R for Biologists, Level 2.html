==Objective==

Taught in the context of biological research, this course helps biologists understand the data analysis and visualization language R. It is a continuation of [[CS101B R for Biologists, Level 1]] and covers advanced topics and projects.

==Course outline==

* Day 1: Basic R commands for loading, manipulating and visualizing data
** How to create, manage and visualize data in R objects â€“ vectors, matrices, data frames, lists
** Good programming practices
** Specials notes, shortcuts, and basic commands that you may have forgotten
** Project: create a function that will compute the t-statistic, fold change, difference and p-value for all genes, and filter the data to keep the up- or down-regulated genes.
* Day 2: Case studies in linear regression, t-test, anova
* Day 3: Advanced graphics with par()
* Day 4: Bioconductor objects and algorithms, and getting differentially regulated genes from Affymetrix CEL files
** More case studies
* Day 5: Project: use limmaGUI or affylmGUI datasets to perform an analysis.

* Professional members get an additional 20% discount

==Logistics==

Online courses are offered via online meeting system.  Access information will be provided prior to the start of the course. Each lecture will last 45 to 90 minutes, depending on the topics covered. For those who cannot attend the lectures at those times, the lectures will be recorded and placed on the course website as Flash videos (resolution reduced by 30%) each day, within one day.  Students will also be able to communicate with the instructor and other students via the course forums.  Lecture attendance is therefore not required.

Since this will be an interactive, hands-on workshop, all attendees will need a computer with a broadband Internet connection (1 Mbps or faster is strongly recommended for those watching the live lecture), a sound card with speakers, a modern Web browser, and the [http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/ Adobe Flash plugin].  A microphone and webcam is not required for this course.  The necessary software, lecture notes and exercises will be provided.

==Certification==

This course is certified by the [[Bioinformatics Organization|Bioinformatics Organization, Inc.]], the largest international affiliation in the field, and it will count as '''5''' "Continuing Scientific Education" (CSE) credits (one credit per contact hour) within the Organization. Students completing the course will receive a certificate attesting to that.
