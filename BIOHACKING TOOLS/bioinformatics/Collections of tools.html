You can start [http://bioinformatics.org/ right here] at Bioinformatics.Org if you are looking for a bioinformatics toolbox.

I cannot recommend strongly enough the Rosalind Franklin Center's "[http://www.rfcgr.mrc.ac.uk/GenomeWeb/ GenomeWeb]".

Of historical interest only now, I guess, is the legendary "[http://www.public.iastate.edu/~pedro/research_tools.html  Pedro's Molecular Biology Search and Analysis Tools]".
