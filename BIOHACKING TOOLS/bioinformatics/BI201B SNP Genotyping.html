==Objective==

This course helps to demystify Affymetrix analysis so that any researcher can take the basic steps to go from a chip image to genotypes, for each SNP, and to the copy number or linkage associated with the SNPs in given samples. Various tools will be covered, such as GCOS, GTYPE, BRLMM, CNAT, Excel, MATLAB, and free tools like Dchip. It is geared towards researchers who conduct microarray-based SNP genotyping experiments to study genome-wide polymorphisms and then use the information for genotyping and linkage analysis. Most scientists are not able to analyze resulting microarray data themselves and are not able to get desired results using traditional tools like Microsoft Word and Excel, or the advanced software provided by commercial vendors. The free solutions come either with a steep learning curve or as black-box interfaces that provide limited functionality, with little or no technical support. In the midst of all this is the fundamental lack of understanding among scientists on how the technology works and what the fundamental parts of the analysis are. 

No experience is required, although prior experience with any other programming language will be helpful. Math skills will also be useful. This course is certified by the [[Bioinformatics Organization|Bioinformatics Organization, Inc.]], the largest international affiliation in the field, and it will count as '''10''' "Continuing Scientific Education" (CSE) credits (one credit per contact hour) within the Organization. Students completing the course will receive a certificate attesting to that.

==Course outline==

* Day 1: Introduction to GCOS â€“ the environment, creating and saving experiments, importing and exporting data, normalization settings, from DAT->CEL->CHP files and their significance, importing and exporting data, SNP chip layout and algorithms for generating genotypes 
* Day 2: GTYPE, BRLMM for generating genotypes, sample mismatch report, gender calls, pedigree check, creating virtual sets, and copy number analysis 
* Day 3: Dchip software: importing SNP data and annotation information into Dchip, LOH analysis, copy number analysis, linkage disequilibrium analysis, allele sharing analysis, and exporting to Excel 
* Day 4: MATLAB: importing SNP data in MATLAB, manipulating and filtering SNP genotypes, automating tasks using API to Affymetrix SDK, building custom user interfaces for advanced applications, and exporting to Excel 
* Day 5: Problem solving session involving some real SNP genotyping data

Online courses are offered on the ASAP online meeting system.  Access information will be provided prior to the start of the course. Each lecture will last 90 to 180 minutes, depending on the topics covered. For those who cannot attend the lectures at those times, the lectures will be recorded and placed on the course website as Flash videos (resolution reduced by 30%) each day, within one day.  Students will also be able to communicate with the instructor and other students via the course forums.  Lecture attendance is therefore not required.

Since this will be an interactive, hands-on workshop, all attendees will need a computer with a broadband Internet connection (1 Mbps or faster is strongly recommended for those watching the live lecture), a sound card with speakers, a modern Web browser, and the [http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/ Adobe Flash plugin].  Please [[ASAP requirements|check the specific system requirements for your computer]].  A microphone and webcam is not required for this course.  The necessary software, lecture notes and exercises will be provided.
