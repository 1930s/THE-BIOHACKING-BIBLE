==Objective==

With systems biology budding as a discipline, there is a colossal need for biologists to understand the interactions within biological networks. There has been much talk about systems biology and protein-protein interactions (PPI), and this course will dig into some of the fundamental issues concerning PPIs, their need and usage. The exercises and take-home messages will encourage students to give some thought to the topics covered and hopefully build some excitement about the field of systems biology. Nevertheless, this course shouldnâ€™t be considered too difficult for beginners. After completing the course, students should be able to understand and find answers to the following questions: 

* Whither systems biology?
* Why PPIs? What else does systems biology involve?
* What has made systems biology distinct from bioinformatics?
* Would PPIs bring out a function for umpteen orphan genes?
* What are the types of interaction data and their layouts?
* What are the online tools for analyzing networks?
* How are high-throughput methods used to measure interactions?
* How are interactions validated?

The student should have a degree in biology or computer science. However, this course covers diverse subjects, and so any graduate with adequate knowledge of biology and computer science may also wish to consider it.  Please come prepared with the name of a gene that interests you, preferentially from the human genome. And also take a note of its transcripts and accession numbers. If you are unsure about which gene to choose, we will leave it as a pro tem for exercises during fourth day. We also suggest that students download Cytoscape from http://cytoscape.org/ with the MCODE plugin. 

The following websites will help the student become acclimated to the subject: 

* http://www.genecards.org/
* http://www.ihop-et.org/UniPub/iHOP/
* http://string.embl.de/
* http://mint.bio.uniroma2.it/mint/Welcome.do/
* http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/
* http://www.bind.ca/
* http://www.prebind.bind.ca/
* http://www.hprd.org/
* http://www.cytoscape.org/

This course is certified by the [[Bioinformatics Organization|Bioinformatics Organization, Inc.]], the largest international affiliation in the field, and it will count as '''5''' "Continuing Scientific Education" (CSE) credits (one credit per contact hour) within the Organization. Students completing the course will receive a certificate attesting to that.

===[[Tuition discounts]]===

* Returning student discount: A 20% (rounded up) discount applies for students who have paid the base tuition (without a similar discount) for a course at Bioinformatics.Org that does '''''not''''' fall in the CS101 range (e.g., CS102A/B) (please use the mail-in registration form rather than PayPal if taking this discount).
* Cluster course discount: A 50% (rounded up) discount (cannot be combined with the 20% discount) applies for students who have paid the base tuition for a course that '''''does''''' fall in the CS101 range (please use the mail-in registration form rather than PayPal if taking this discount).

Online courses are offered on the ASAP online meeting system.  Access information will be provided prior to the start of the course. Each lecture will last 45 to 90 minutes, depending on the topics covered. For those who cannot attend the lectures at those times, the lectures will be recorded and placed on the course website as Flash videos (resolution reduced by 30%) each day, within one day.  Students will also be able to communicate with the instructor and other students via the course forums.  Lecture attendance is therefore not required.

Since this will be an interactive, hands-on workshop, all attendees will need a computer with a broadband Internet connection (1 Mbps or faster is strongly recommended for those watching the live lecture), a sound card with speakers, a modern Web browser, and the [http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/ Adobe Flash plugin].  Please [[ASAP requirements|check the specific system requirements for your computer]].  A microphone and webcam is not required for this course.  The necessary software, lecture notes and exercises will be provided.
