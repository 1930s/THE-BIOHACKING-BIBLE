==Objective==

This course aims at teaching Biologists how to analyze and manipulate biological images, and extract meaningful information from them, using a variety of tools. For large quantities of images that need to be analyzed with the same algorithm, the course teaches how to automate these routine tasks and generate reports in a high throughput fashion.

==Instructors==

* [[Shailender Nagpal]]

==Course outline==

The course is divided into 4 sessions, roughly 1-1.5 hours each. The 5th session is reserved for project discussion and any other issues the students may want to discuss. There will be quizzes and homework assignments after every lecture.

* Day 1: The different types of image file formats, and how the image data is stored in them. Tools to perform simple operations such as zoom, pan, rotate, crop, cut, paste, stretch/skew, etc will be introduced. File format conversion and compression issues will be discussed.

* Day 2: Fundamentals of image processing, such as contrast and brightness adjustment, sampling, transformation, 

* Day 3: More fundamentals like filtering, registration, morphological operations. These techniques will be used to demonstrate noise removal, image deblurring, image conversion, edge detection, etc.

* Day 4: The automation of tasks in analyzing a single image, and then using the algorithm to analyze multiple images. GUI tool development for point-n-click users will be shown. Project discussion.

Online courses are offered on the ASAP online meeting system.  Access information will be provided prior to the start of the course. Each lecture will last 90 to 180 minutes, depending on the topics covered. For those who cannot attend the lectures at those times, the lectures will be recorded and placed on the course website as Flash videos (resolution reduced by 30%) each day, within one day.  Students will also be able to communicate with the instructor and other students via the course forums.  Lecture attendance is therefore not required.

Since this will be an interactive, hands-on workshop, all attendees will need a computer with a broadband Internet connection (1 Mbps or faster is strongly recommended for those watching the live lecture), a sound card with speakers, a modern Web browser, and the [http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/ Adobe Flash plugin].  Please [[ASAP requirements|check the specific system requirements for your computer]].  A microphone and webcam is not required for this course.  The necessary software, lecture notes and exercises will be provided.

Some programming experience will be helpful, but not required.

This course is certified by the [[Bioinformatics Organization|Bioinformatics Organization, Inc.]], the largest international affiliation in the field, and it will count as '''5''' "Continuing Scientific Education" (CSE) credits (one credit per contact hour) within the Organization. Students completing the course will receive a certificate attesting to that.
