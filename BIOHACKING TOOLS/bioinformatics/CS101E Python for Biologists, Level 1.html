==Objective==

This course aims at teaching biologists how to use Python as a programming language to automate routine data management tasks in biological research and solve difficult data-related computational problems. Data could be DNA or amino acid sequence, microarray data, images, mass spectrometry data, LIMS data, or any other kind of biological information.

==Instructors==

* [[Shailender Nagpal]]

==Course outline==

The course is divided into 4 sessions, roughly 1-1.5 hours each. The 5th session is reserved for project discussion and any other issues the students may want to discuss. There will be quizzes and homework assignments after every lecture.

* Day 1: Installation issues and simple exercises that illustrate how to create and execute simple Python programs using variables and the print statement. The Python interpreter and editor will be introduced.

* Day 2: Fundamentals of programming with Python, such as operators (mathematical, conditional, logical), file input/output, loops (if-then-else, for, while), etc.

* Day 3: Functions, hashes and object oriented programming.

* Day 4: Cover the installation of Python packages such as iPython, NumPy (Numeric Python), and Biopython. Some basic tasks in these packages will be covered. Project discussion.

Online courses are offered on the ASAP online meeting system.  Access information will be provided prior to the start of the course. Each lecture will last 90 to 180 minutes, depending on the topics covered. For those who cannot attend the lectures at those times, the lectures will be recorded and placed on the course website as Flash videos (resolution reduced by 30%) each day, within one day.  Students will also be able to communicate with the instructor and other students via the course forums.  Lecture attendance is therefore not required.

Since this will be an interactive, hands-on workshop, all attendees will need a computer with a broadband Internet connection (1 Mbps or faster is strongly recommended for those watching the live lecture), a sound card with speakers, a modern Web browser, and the [http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/ Adobe Flash plugin].  Please [[ASAP requirements|check the specific system requirements for your computer]].  A microphone and webcam is not required for this course.  The necessary software, lecture notes and exercises will be provided.

No programming experience is required, just a need to learn how to program.

This course is certified by the [[Bioinformatics Organization|Bioinformatics Organization, Inc.]], the largest international affiliation in the field, and it will count as '''5''' "Continuing Scientific Education" (CSE) credits (one credit per contact hour) within the Organization. Students completing the course will receive a certificate attesting to that.
