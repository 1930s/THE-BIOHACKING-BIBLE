==Video==

ASAP is compatible with most properly installed webcams, including the following:

==Audio==

To broadcast audio, you need at least:
* A full-duplex sound card or a USB port.
* A speaker and microphone that plug into either the sound card or the USB port or a headset that plugs into either the sound card or the USB port. We strongly recommend using a headset to reduce feedback.
* A modem with a speed of 56 Kbps or faster and a working connection speed of 56 Kbps or faster. Note, however, that you will achieve best results when using at least a DSL connection.
