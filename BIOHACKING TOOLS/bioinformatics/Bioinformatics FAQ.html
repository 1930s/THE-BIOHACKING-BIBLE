==Centers of bioinformatics activity: Where is bioinformatics done?==

The biggest and best source of bioinformatics links I have encountered is the [http://www.rfcgr.mrc.ac.uk/GenomeWeb/ Genome Web] at the [http://www.rfcgr.mrc.ac.uk/ Rosalind Franklin Centre for Genomics Research] at the [http://www.hinxton.wellcome.ac.uk/ Genome Campus] near [http://www.cambridge.gov.uk/cambridge.htm Cambridge], UK. Most of the links below come from that resource. My list is necessarily limited by comparison.

==Education: Where can I study bioinformatics?==

Below are complete, full-time degree programmes rather than on individual study modules. You can go to other places, however, if you are looking for short courses. Rockefeller has a [http://linkage.rockefeller.edu/wli/bioinfocourse/ list] that is mirrored at various other sites. ICSB also maintains a [http://www.iscb.org/univ.shtml list].

If you are interested in U.S. programmes, here's [http://wbiomed.curtin.edu.au/teach/biochem/resources/Bioinformatics.html a list from Curtin] in Australia, and here's [http://www.smi.stanford.edu/academics/pdfs/degree_table.pdf a list from Stanford University].

Those wanting to find programmes in the Asia Pacific region could have a look at [http://www.apbionet.org/project/edu/index.shtml this resource] maintained by the Asia Pacific Bioinformatics Network APBioNet.

In the UK [http://www.rfcgr.mrc.ac.uk/CCP11/index.jsp The Bioinformatics Resource] (part of the [http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/ BBSRC]'s [http://www.rfcgr.mrc.ac.uk/CCP11/index.jsp  CCP11] project) project maintains (among many other resources) lists of (mainly) British [http://www.rfcgr.mrc.ac.uk/CCP11/directory/directory_mastersdegrees.jsp?Rp=20  Masters] and [http://www.rfcgr.mrc.ac.uk/CCP11/directory/directory_phds.jsp?Rp=20  PhDs] in bioinformatics.
