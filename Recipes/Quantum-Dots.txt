1. disperse the QD in CH2Cl2 
2. add MAA.  -> precipitate could be observed.
3. add TEA as dropwise until precipitate diappears. -> reaction heat could be felt.
4. add excess acetone to obtain precipitate of ligand exchanged InP/ZnS 
5. centrifugate to recover the InP/ZnS. Repeat this washing ~3 times until the smell of MAA disappears.
6. add water to obtain uniform dispersion.
If the precipitation could not observed at 4, a drop of NH3 aq may be added to dissociate the ligand MAA to COO-.
Both MAA and TEA seem to etch the ZnS slightly, so ZnS shell should be formd a little bit thicker than ideal thickness.
